    kants prolegomena1 although

	a small book is indubitably

    the most important of his writings it furnishes us with a key to his main work

    the critique of pure reason in fact it is an extract

    containing all the salient ideas of kants system it approaches the subject in the

    simplest and most direct way and is therefore best adapted as an introduction into

    his philosophy for this reason the open court publishing company has deemed it

    advisable to bring out a new edition of the work keeping in view its broader use as

    a preliminary survey and explanation of kants philosophy in general in order to

    make the book useful for this broader purpose the editor has not only stated his own

    views concerning the problem underlying the prolegomena see

    page 167 et seq but has also collected the most important materials which have

    reference to kants philosophy or to the reception which was accorded to it in

    various quarters see page 241 et seq the selections have not been made from a

    partisan standpoint but have been chosen with a view to characterising the attitude

    of different minds and to directing the student to the best literature on the

    subject

  
it is not without good reasons that the appearance of the critique

  of pure reason is regarded as the beginning of a new era in the

  history of philosophy and so it seems that a comprehension of kants position whether

  we accept or reject it is indispensable to the student of philosophy it is not his

  solution which makes the sage of knigsberg the initiator of

  modern thought but his formulation of the problem
    
the present translation is practically new but it goes without

  saying that the editor utilised the labors of his predecessors among whom prof john

  p mahaffy and john h bernard deserve special credit richardsons translation of 1818

  may be regarded as superseded and has not been consulted but occasional reference has

  been made to that of prof ernest belfort bax considering the difficulties under which

  even these translators labored we must recognise the fact that they did their work

  well with painstaking diligence great love of the subject and good judgment the

  editor of the present translation has the advantage of being to the manor born

  moreover he is pretty well versed in kants style and wherever he differs from his

  predecessors in the interpretation of a construction he has deviated from them not

  without good reasons nevertheless there are some passages which will still remain

  doubtful though happily they are of little consequence


    as a curiosum in richardsons translation professor mahaffy

    mentions that the words widersinnig gewundene schnecken

    which simply means symmetric helices2 are rendered by snails rolled up

    contrary to all sensea wording that is itself contrary to all sense and makes the

    whole paragraph unintelligible we may add an instance of another mistake that misses

    the mark kant employs in the appendix a word that is no longer used in german he

    speaks of the cento der metaphysik as having neue lappen and einen

	vernderten zuschnitt mr bax translates cento by body lappen by outgrowths

	and zuschnitt by figure his mistake is perhaps not less excusable than richardsons it is certainly not less comical

	and it also destroys the sense which in the present case is a very striking simile cento is a latin

	word3 derived from the greek 4 meaning

	a garment of many patches sewed together or as we might now say a crazy quilt

  
    
in the hope that this book will prove useful the open court

  publishing company offers it as a help to the student of philosophy

introduction
these prolegomena are destined for the use not of pupils but of

  future teachers and even the latter should not expect that they will be serviceable

  for the systematic exposition of a readymade science but merely for the discovery of

  the science itself
there are scholarly men to whom the history of philosophy both

  ancient and modern is philosophy itself for these the present prolegomena are not

  written they must wait till those who endeavor to draw from the fountain of reason

  itself have completed their work it will then be the historians turn to inform the

  world of what has been done unfortunately nothing can be said which in their opinion

  has not been said before and truly the same prophecy applies to all future time for

  since the human reason has for many centuries speculated upon innumerable objects in

  various ways it is hardly to be expected that we should not be able to discover

  analogies for every new idea among the old sayings of past ages
my object is to persuade all those who think metaphysics worth

  studying that it is absolutely necessary to pause a moment and neglecting all that

  has been done to propose first the preliminary question whether such a thing as

  metaphysics be at all possible
if it be a science how comes it that it cannot like other

  sciences obtain universal and permanent recognition if not how can it maintain its

  pretensions and keep the human mind in suspense with hopes never ceasing yet never

  fulfilled whether then we demonstrate our knowledge or our ignorance in this field we

  must come once for all to a definite conclusion respecting the nature of this socalled

  science which cannot possibly remain on its present footing it seems almost

  ridiculous while every other science is continually advancing that in this which

  pretends to be wisdom incarnate for whose oracle every one inquires we should

  constantly move round the same spot without gaining a single step and so its

  followers having melted away we do not find men confident of their ability to shine in

  other sciences venturing their reputation here where everybody however ignorant in

  other matters may deliver a final verdict as in this domain there is as yet no

  standard weight and measure to distinguish sound knowledge from shallow talk
after all it is nothing extraordinary in the elaboration of a

  science when men begin to wonder how far it has advanced that the question should at

  last occur whether and how such a science is possible human reason so delights in

  constructions that it has several times built up a tower and then razed it to examine

  the nature of the foundation it is never too late to become wise but if the change

  comes late there is always more difficulty in starting a reform
the question whether a science be possible presupposes a doubt as

  to its actuality but such a doubt offends the men whose whole possessions consist of

  this supposed jewel hence he who raises the doubt must expect opposition from all

  sides some in the proud consciousness of their possessions which are ancient and

  therefore considered legitimate will take their metaphysical compendia in their hands

  and look down on him with contempt others who never see anything except it be

  identical with what they have seen before will not understand him and everything will

  remain for a time as if nothing had happened to excite the concern or the hope for

  an impending change


    nevertheless i venture to predict that the independent reader of these prolegomena

    will not only doubt his previous science but ultimately be fully persuaded that it

    cannot exist unless the demands here stated on which its possibility depends be

    satisfied and as this has never been done that there is as yet no such thing as

    metaphysics but as it can never cease to be in demand5since the interests of common sense are

    intimately interwoven with it he must confess that a radical reform or rather a new

    birth of the science after an original plan are unavoidable however men may

    struggle against it for a while

  
since the essays of locke and leibnitz or rather since the origin

  of metaphysics so far as we know its history nothing has ever happened which was more

  decisive to its fate than the attack made upon it by david hume he threw no light on

  this species of knowledge but he certainly struck a spark from which light might have

  been obtained had it caught some inflammable substance and had its smouldering fire

  been carefully nursed and developed


    hume started from a single but important concept in metaphysics viz that of cause

    and effect including its derivatives force and action etc he challenges reason

    which pretends to have given birth to this idea from herself to answer him by what

    right she thinks anything to be so constituted that if that thing be posited

    something else also must necessarily be posited for this is the meaning of the

    concept of cause he demonstrated irrefutably that it was perfectly impossible for

    reason to think a priori and by means of concepts a

    combination involving necessity we cannot at all see why in consequence of the

    existence of one thing another must necessarily exist or how the concept of such a

    combination can arise a priori hence he inferred that

    reason was altogether deluded with reference to this concept which she erroneously

    considered as one of her children whereas in reality it was nothing but a bastard of

    imagination impregnated by experience which subsumed certain representations under

    the law of association and mistook the subjective necessity of habit for an

    objective necessity arising from insight hence he inferred that reason had no power

    to think such combinations even generally because her concepts would then be purely

    fictitious and all her pretended a priori cognitions nothing

    but common experiences marked with a false stamp in plain language there is not and

    cannot be any such thing as metaphysics at all6

however hasty and mistaken humes conclusion may appear it was at

  least founded upon investigation and this investigation deserved the concentrated

  attention of the brighter spirits of his day as well as determined efforts on their

  part to discover if possible a happier solution of the problem in the sense proposed

  by him all of which would have speedily resulted in a complete reform of the

  science
but hume suffered the usual misfortune of metaphysicians of not

  being understood it is positively painful to see how utterly his opponents reid

  oswald beattie and lastly priestley missed the point of the problem for while they

  were ever taking for granted that which he doubted and demonstrating with zeal and

  often with impudence that which he never thought of doubting they so misconstrued his

  valuable suggestion that everything remained in its old condition as if nothing had

  happened
the question was not whether the concept of cause was right

  useful and even indispensable for our knowledge of nature for this hume had never

  doubted but whether that concept could be thought by reason a

  priori and consequently whether it possessed an inner truth independent of all

  experience implying a wider application than merely to the objects of experience this

  was humes problem it was a question concerning the origin not concerning the

  indispensable need of the concept were the former decided the conditions of the use

  and the sphere of its valid application would have been determined as a matter of

  course
but to satisfy the conditions of the problem the opponents of the

  great thinker should have penetrated very deeply into the nature of reason so far as

  it is concerned with pure thinkinga task which did not suit them they found a more

  convenient method of being defiant without any insight viz the appeal to

  common sense it is indeed a great gift of god to possess

  right or as they now call it plain common sense but this common sense must be shown

  practically by wellconsidered and reasonable thoughts and words not by appealing to

  it as an oracle when no rational justification can be advanced to appeal to common

  sense when insight and science fail and no soonerthis is one of the subtile

  discoveries of modern times by means of which the most superficial ranter can safely

  enter the lists with the most thorough thinker and hold his own but as long as a

  particle of insight remains no one would think of having recourse to this subterfuge

  for what is it but an appeal to the opinion of the multitude of whose applause the

  philosopher is ashamed while the popular charlatan glories and confides in it i

  should think that hume might fairly have laid as much claim to common sense as beattie

  and in addition to a critical reason such as the latter did not possess which keeps

  common sense in check and prevents it from speculating or if speculations are under

  discussion restrains the desire to decide because it cannot satisfy itself concerning

  its own arguments by this means alone can common sense remain sound chisels and

  hammers may suffice to work a piece of wood but for steelengraving we require an

  engravers needle thus common sense and speculative understanding are each serviceable

  in their own way the former in judgments which apply immediately to experience the

  latter when we judge universally from mere concepts as in metaphysics where sound

  common sense so called in spite of the inapplicability of the word has no right to

  judge at all
i openly confess the suggestion of david hume was the very thing

  which many years ago first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations

  in the field of speculative philosophy quite a new direction i was far from following

  him in the conclusions at which he arrived by regarding not the whole of his problem

  but a part which by itself can give us no information if we start from a

  wellfounded but undeveloped thought which another has bequeathed to us we may well

  hope by continued reflection to advance farther than the acute man to whom we owe the

  first spark of light
i therefore first tried whether humes objection could not be put

  into a general form and soon found that the concept of the connexion of cause and

  effect was by no means the only idea by which the understanding thinks the connexion of

  things a priori but rather that metaphysics consists

  altogether of such connexions i sought to ascertain their number and when i had

  satisfactorily succeeded in this by starting from a single principle i proceeded to

  the deduction of these concepts which i was now certain were not deduced from

  experience as hume had apprehended but sprang from the pure understanding this

  deduction which seemed impossible to my acute predecessor which had never even

  occurred to any one else though no one had hesitated to use the concepts without

  investigating the basis of their objective validity was the most difficult task ever

  undertaken in the service of metaphysics and the worst was that metaphysics such as

  it then existed could not assist me in the least because this deduction alone can

  render metaphysics possible but as soon as i had succeeded in solving humes problem

  not merely in a particular case but with respect to the whole faculty of pure reason

  i could proceed safely though slowly to determine the whole sphere of pure reason

  completely and from general principles in its circumference as well as in its

  contents this was required for metaphysics in order to construct its system according

  to a reliable method
but i fear that the execution of humes problem in its widest

  extent viz my critique of the pure reason will fare as the problem itself fared

  when first proposed it will be misjudged because it is misunderstood and

  misunderstood because men choose to skim through the book and not to think through

  ita disagreeable task because the work is dry obscure opposed to all ordinary

  notions and moreover longwinded i confess however i did not expect to hear from

  philosophers complaints of want of popularity entertainment and facility when the

  existence of a highly prized and indispensable cognition is at stake which cannot be

  established otherwise than by the strictest rules of methodic precision popularity may

  follow but is inadmissible at the beginning yet as regards a certain obscurity

  arising partly from the diffuseness of the plan owing to which the principal points of

  the investigation are easily lost sight of the complaint is just and i intend to

  remove it by the present prolegomena
the firstmentioned work which discusses the pure faculty of

  reason in its whole compass and bounds will remain the foundation to which the

  prolegomena as a preliminary exercise refer for our critique must first be

  established as a complete and perfected science before we can think of letting

  metaphysics appear on the scene or even have the most distant hope of attaining

  it
we have been long accustomed to seeing antiquated knowledge

  produced as new by taking it out of its former context and reducing it to system in a

  new suit of any fancy pattern under new titles most readers will set out by expecting

  nothing else from the critique but these prolegomena may persuade him that it is a

  perfectly new science of which no one has ever even thought the very idea of which

  was unknown and for which nothing hitherto accomplished can be of the smallest use

  except it be the suggestion of humes doubts yet ever he did not suspect such a

  formal science but ran his ship ashore for safetys sake landing on scepticism

  there to let it lie and rot whereas my object is rather to give it a pilot who by

  means of safe astronomical principles drawn from a knowledge of the globe and provided

  with a complete chart and compass may steer the ship safely whither he listeth
if in a new science which is wholly isolated and unique in its

  kind we started with the prejudice that we can judge of things by means of our

  previously acquired knowledge which is precisely what has first to be called in

  question we should only fancy we saw everywhere what we had already known the

  expressions having a similar sound only that all would appear utterly metamorphosed

  senseless and unintelligible because we should have as a foundation our own notions

  made by long habit a second nature instead of the authors but the longwindedness of

  the work so far as it depends on the subject and not the exposition its consequent

  unavoidable dryness and its scholastic precision are qualities which can only benefit

  the science though they may discredit the book
few writers are gifted with the subtilty and at the same time with

  the grace of david hume or with the depth as well as the elegance of moses

  mendelssohn yet i flatter myself i might have made my own exposition popular had my

  object been merely to sketch out a plan and leave its completion to others instead of

  having my heart in the welfare of the science to which i had devoted myself so long

  in truth it required no little constancy and even selfdenial to postpone the sweets

  of an immediate success to the prospect of a slower but more lasting reputation
making plans is often the occupation of an opulent and boastful

  mind which thus obtains the reputation of a creative genius by demanding what it

  cannot itself supply by censuring what it cannot improve and by proposing what it

  knows not where to find and yet something more should belong to a sound plan of a

  general critique of pure reason than mere conjectures if this plan is to be other than

  the usual declamations of pious aspirations but pure reason is a sphere so separate

  and selfcontained that we cannot touch a part without affecting all the rest we can

  therefore do nothing without first determining the position of each part and its

  relation to the rest for as our judgment cannot be corrected by anything without the

  validity and use of every part depends upon the relation in which it stands to all the

  rest within the domain of reason
so in the structure of an organized body the end of each member

  can only be deduced from the full conception of the whole it may then be said of

  such a critique that it is never trustworthy except it be perfectly complete down to

  the smallest elements of pure reason in the sphere of this faculty you can determine

  either everything or nothing
but although a mere sketch preceding the critique of pure reason

  would be unintelligible unreliable and useless it is all the more useful as a

  sequel for so we are able to grasp the whole to examine in detail the chief points of

  importance in the science and to improve in many respects our exposition as compared

  with the first execution of the work


    after the completion of the work i offer here such a plan which is sketched out after

    an analytical method while the work itself had to be executed in the synthetical

    style in order that the science may present all its articulations as the structure

    of a peculiar cognitive faculty in their natural combination but should any reader

    find this plan which i publish as the prolegomena to any future metaphysics still

    obscure let him consider that not every one is bound to study metaphysics that many

    minds will succeed very well in the exact and even in deep sciences more closely

    allied to practical experience7 while they cannot succeed in

    investigations dealing exclusively with abstract concepts in such cases men should

    apply their talents to other subjects but he who undertakes to judge or still more

    to construct a system of metaphysics must satisfy the demands here made either by

    adopting my solution or by thoroughly refuting it and substituting another to

    evade it is impossible

  
in conclusion let it be remembered that this muchabused obscurity

  frequently serving as a mere pretext under which people hide their own indolence or

  dullness has its uses since all who in other sciences observe a judicious silence

  speak authoritatively in metaphysics and make bold decisions because their ignorance

  is not here contrasted with the knowledge of others yet it does contrast with sound

  critical principles which we may therefore commend in the words of virgil
ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent
bees are defending their hives against drones those indolent

  creatures
prolegomena
preamble on the peculiarities of all metaphysical cognition
 1  of the

  sources of metaphysics
if it becomes desirable to formulate any cognition as science it

  will be necessary first to determine accurately those peculiar features which no other

  science has in common with it constituting its characteristics otherwise the

  boundaries of all sciences become confused and none of them can be treated thoroughly

  according to its nature
the characteristics of a science may consist of a simple difference

  of object or of the sources of cognition or of the kind of cognition or perhaps of

  all three conjointly on this therefore depends the idea of a possible science and

  its territory
first as concerns the sources of metaphysical cognition its very

  concept implies that they cannot be empirical its principles including not only its

  maxims but its basic notions must never be derived from experience it must not be

  physical but metaphysical knowledge viz knowledge lying beyond experience it can

  therefore have for its basis neither external experience which is the source of

  physics proper nor internal which is the basis of empirical psychology it is

  therefore a priori knowledge coming from pure understanding

  and pure reason
but so far metaphysics would not be distinguish able from pure

  mathematics it must therefore be called pure philosophical cognition and for the

  meaning of this term i refer to the critique of the pure reason ii method of

  transcendentalism chap i sec i where the distinction between these two

  employments of the reason is sufficiently explained so far concerning the sources of

  metaphysical cognition
 2  concerning the kind of cognition which can

  alone be called metaphysical
a  of the

  distinction between analytical and synthetical judgments in generalthe

  peculiarity of its sources demands that metaphysical cognition must consist of nothing

  but a priori judgments but whatever be their origin or their

  logical form there is a distinction in judgments as to their content according to

  which they are either merely explicative adding nothing to the content of the

  cognition or expansive increasing the given cognition the former may be called

  analytical the latter synthetical judgments
analytical judgments express nothing in the predicate but what has

  been already actually thought in the concept of the subject though not so distinctly

  or with the same full consciousness when i say all bodies are extended i have not

  amplified in the least my concept of body but have only analysed it as extension was

  really thought to belong to that concept before the judgment was made though it was

  not expressed this judgment is therefore analytical on the contrary this judgment

  all bodies have weight contains in its predicate something not actually thought in the

  general concept of the body it amplifies my knowledge by adding something to my

  concept and must therefore be called synthetical
b  the common principle of all analytical

  judgments is the law of contradictionall analytical judgments depend wholly on

  the law of contradiction and are in their nature a priori

  cognitions whether the concepts that supply them with matter be empirical or not for

  the predicate of an affirmative analytical judgment is already contained in the concept

  of the subject of which it cannot be denied without contradiction in the same way its

  opposite is necessarily denied of the subject in an analytical but negative judgment

  by the same law of contradiction such is the nature of the judgments all bodies are

  extended and no bodies are unextended ie simple
for this very reason all analytical judgments are a priori even when the concepts are empirical as for example gold is a

  yellow metal for to know this i require no experience beyond my concept of gold as a

  yellow metal it is in fact the very concept and i need only analyse it without

  looking beyond it elsewhere
c  synthetical judgments require a different

  principle from the law of contradictionthere are synthetical a posteriori judgments of empirical origin but there are also others which

  are proved to be certain a priori and which spring from pure

  understanding and reason yet they both agree in this that they cannot possibly spring

  from the principle of analysis viz the law of contradiction alone they require a

  quite different principle though from whatever they may be deduced they must be

  subject to the law of contradiction which must never be violated even though

  everything cannot be deduced from it i shall first classify synthetical judgments
1  empirical judgments are always

  synthetical for it would be absurd to base an analytical judgment on experience as

  our concept suffices for the purpose without requiring any testimony from experience

  that body is extended is a judgment established a priori and

  not an empirical judgment for before appealing to experience we already have all the

  conditions of the judgment in the concept from which we have but to elicit the

  predicate according to the law of contradiction and thereby to become conscious of the

  necessity of the judgment which experience could not even teach us
2  mathematical judgments are all

  synthetical this fact seems hitherto to have altogether escaped the observation of

  those who have analysed human reason it even seems directly opposed to all their

  conjectures though incontestably certain and most important in its consequences for

  as it was found that the conclusions of mathematicians all proceed according to the law

  of contradiction as is demanded by all apodeictic certainty men persuaded themselves

  that the fundamental principles were known from the same law this was a great mistake

  for a synthetical proposition can indeed be comprehended according to the law of

  contradiction but only by presupposing another synthetical proposition from which it

  follows but never in itself
first of all we must observe that all proper mathematical

  judgments are a priori and not empirical because they carry

  with them necessity which cannot be obtained from experience but if this be not

  conceded to me very good i shall confine my assertion to pure

  mathematics the very notion of which implies that it contains pure a priori and not empirical cognitions
it might at first be thought that the proposition 7  5  12 is a

  mere analytical judgment following from the concept of the sum of seven and five

  according to the law of contradiction but on closer examination it appears that the

  concept of the sum of 7  5 contains merely their union in a single number without its

  being at all thought what the particular number is that unites them the concept of

  twelve is by no means thought by merely thinking of the combination of seven and five

  and analyse this possible sum as we may we shall not discover twelve in the concept

  we must go beyond these concepts by calling to our aid some concrete image

  anschauung ie either our five fingers or five points as

  segner has it in his arithmetic and we must add successively the units of the five

  given in some concrete image anschauung to the concept of

  seven hence our concept is really amplified by the proposition 7  5  12 and we add

  to the first a second not thought in it arithmetical judgments are therefore

  synthetical and the more plainly according as we take larger numbers for in such

  cases it is clear that however closely we analyse our concepts without calling visual

  images anschauung to our aid we can never find the sum by

  such mere dissection
all principles of geometry are no less analytical that a straight

  line is the shortest path between two points is a synthetical proposition for my

  concept of straight contains nothing of quantity but only a quality the attribute of

  shortness is therefore altogether additional and cannot be obtained by any analysis of

  the concept here too visualisation anschauung must come to

  aid us it alone makes the synthesis possible


    some other principles assumed by geometers are indeed actually analytical and

    depend on the law of contradiction but they only serve as identical propositions

    as a method of concatenation and not as principles eg a  a the whole is equal

    to itself or a  b  a the whole is greater than its part and yet even these

    though they are recognised as valid from mere concepts are only admitted in

    mathematics because they can be represented in some visual form anschauung what usually makes us believe that the predicate of such

    apodeictic8 judgments is already contained in our

    concept and that the judgment is therefore analytical is the duplicity of the

    expression requesting us to think a certain predicate as of necessity implied in the

    thought of a given concept which necessity attaches to the concept but the question

    is not what we are requested to join in thought to the given

    concept but what we actually think together with and in it though obscurely and so

    it appears that the predicate belongs to these concepts necessarily indeed yet not

    directly but indirectly by an added visualisation anschauung

  
 3  a remark on the general division of

  judgments into analytical and synthetical
this division is indispensable as concerns the critique of human

  understanding and therefore deserves to be called classical though otherwise it is of

  little use but this is the reason why dogmatic philosophers who always seek the

  sources of metaphysical judgments in metaphysics itself and not apart from it in the

  pure laws of reason generally altogether neglected this apparently obvious

  distinction thus the celebrated wolf and his acute follower baumgarten came to seek

  the proof of the principle of sufficient reason which is clearly synthetical in the

  principle of contradiction in lockes essay however i find an indication of my

  division for in the fourth book chap iii  9 seq having discussed the

  various connexions of representations in judgments and their sources one of which he

  makes identity and contradiction analytical judgments and another the coexistence

  of representations in a subject he confesses  10 that our a

  priori knowledge of the latter is very narrow and almost nothing but in his

  remarks on this species of cognition there is so little of what is definite and

  reduced to rules that we cannot wonder if no one not even hume was led to make

  investigations concerning this sort of judgments for such general and yet definite

  principles are not easily learned from other men who have had them obscurely in their

  minds we must hit on them first by our own reflexion then we find them elsewhere

  where we could not possibly have found them at first because the authors themselves

  did not know that such an idea lay at the basis of their observations men who never

  think independently have nevertheless the acuteness to discover everything after it

  has been once shown them in what was said long since though no one ever saw it there

  before
 4  the general question of the

  prolegomenais metaphysics at all possible
were a metaphysics which could maintain its place as a science

  really in existence could we say here is metaphysics learn it and it will convince

  you irresistibly and irrevocably of its truth this question would be useless and

  there would only remain that other question which would rather be a test of our

  acuteness than a proof of the existence of the thing itself how is the science

  possible and how does reason come to attain it but human reason has not been so

  fortunate in this case there is no single book to which you can point as you do to

  euclid and say this is metaphysics here you may find the noblest objects of this

  science the knowledge of a highest being and of a future existence proved from

  principles of pure reason we can be shown indeed many judgments demonstrably certain

  and never questioned but these are all analytical and rather concern the materials

  and the scaffolding for metaphysics than the extension of knowledge which is our

  proper object in studying it  2 even supposing you produce synthetical judgments

  such as the law of sufficient reason which you have never proved as you ought to

  from pure reason a priori though we gladly concede its truth

  you lapse when they come to be employed for your principal object into such doubtful

  assertions that in all ages one metaphysics has contradicted another either in its

  assertions or their proofs and thus has itself destroyed its own claim to lasting

  assent nay the very attempts to set up such a science are the main cause of the early

  appearance of scepticism a mental attitude in which reason treats itself with such

  violence that it could never have arisen save from complete despair of ever satisfying

  our most important aspirations for long before men began to inquire into nature

  methodically they consulted abstract reason which had to some extent been exercised

  by means of ordinary experience for reason is ever present while laws of nature must

  usually be discovered with labor so metaphysics floated to the surface like foam

  which dissolved the moment it was scooped off but immediately there appeared a new

  supply on the surface to be ever eagerly gathered up by some while others instead of

  seeking in the depths the cause of the phenomenon thought they showed their wisdom by

  ridiculing the idle labor of their neighbors
the essential and distinguishing feature of pure mathematical

  cognition among all other a priori cognitions is that it

  cannot at all proceed from concepts but only by means of the construction of concepts

  see critique ii method of transcendentalism chap i sect 1 as therefore in its

  judgments it must proceed beyond the concept to that which its corresponding

  visualisation anschauung contains these judgments neither

  can nor ought to arise analytically by dissecting the concept but are all

  synthetical
i cannot refrain from pointing out the disadvantage resulting to

  philosophy from the neglect of this easy and apparently insignificant observation hume

  being prompted a task worthy of a philosopher to cast his eye over the whole field of

  a priori cognitions in which human understanding claims such

  mighty possessions heedlessly severed from it a whole and indeed its most valuable

  province viz pure mathematics for he thought its nature or so to speak the

  stateconstitution of this empire depended on totally different principles namely on

  the law of contradiction alone and although he did not divide judgments in this manner

  formally and universally as i have done here what he said was equivalent to this that

  mathematics contains only analytical but metaphysics synthetical a

  priori judgments in this however he was greatly mistaken and the mistake had

  a decidedly injurious effect upon his whole conception but for this he would have

  extended his question concerning the origin of our synthetical judgments far beyond the

  metaphysical concept of causality and included in it the possibility of mathematics

  a priori also for this latter he must have assumed to be

  equally synthetical and then he could not have based his metaphysical judgments on

  mere experience without subjecting the axioms of mathematics equally to experience a

  thing which he was far too acute to do the good company into which metaphysics would

  thus have been brought would have saved it from the danger of a contemptuous

  illtreatment for the thrust intended for it must have reached mathematics which was

  not and could not have been humes intention thus that acute man would have been led

  into considerations which must needs be similar to those that now occupy us but which

  would have gained inestimably by his inimitably elegant style
metaphysical judgments properly so called are all synthetical we

  must distinguish judgments pertaining to metaphysics from metaphysical judgments

  properly so called many of the former are analytical but they only afford the means

  for metaphysical judgments which are the whole end of the science and which are

  always synthetical for if there be concepts pertaining to metaphysics as for

  example that of substance the judgments springing from simple analysis of them also

  pertain to metaphysics as for example substance is that which only exists as

  subject and by means of several such analytical judgments we seek to approach the

  definition of the concept but as the analysis of a pure concept of the understanding

  pertaining to metaphysics does not proceed in any different manner from the dissection

  of any other even empirical concepts not pertaining to metaphysics such as air is

  an elastic fluid the elasticity of which is not destroyed by any known degree of

  cold it follows that the concept indeed but not the analytical judgment is properly

  metaphysical this science has something peculiar in the production of its a priori cognitions which must therefore be distinguished from the

  features it has in common with other rational knowledge thus the judgment that all

  the substance in things is permanent is a synthetical and properly metaphysical

  judgment
if the a priori principles which

  constitute the materials of metaphysics have first been collected according to fixed

  principles then their analysis will be of great value it might be taught as a

  particular part as a philosophia definitiva containing

  nothing but analytical judgments pertaining to metaphysics and could be treated

  separately from the synthetical which constitute metaphysics proper for indeed these

  analyses are not elsewhere of much value except in metaphysics ie as regards the

  synthetical judgments which are to be generated by these previously analysed

  concepts
the conclusion drawn in this section then is that metaphysics is

  properly concerned with synethetical propositions a priori and

  these alone constitute its end for which it indeed requires various dissections of its

  concepts viz of its analytical judgments but wherein the procedure is not different

  from that in every other kind of knowledge in which we merely seek to render our

  concepts distinct by analysis but the generation of a priori

  cognition by concrete images as well as by concepts in fine of synthetical

  propositions a priori in philosophical cognition constitutes

  the essential subject of metaphysics
weary therefore as well of dogmatism which teaches us nothing as

  of scepticism which does not even promise us anything not even the quiet state of a

  contented ignorance disquieted by the importance of knowledge so much needed and

  lastly rendered suspicious by long experience of all knowledge which we believe we

  possess or which offers itself under the title of pure reason there remains but one

  critical question on the answer to which our future procedure depends viz

  is metaphysics at all possible but this question must be

  answered not by sceptical objections to the asseverations of some actual system of

  metaphysics for we do not as yet admit such a thing to exist but from the

  conception as yet only problematical of a science of this sort
in the critique of pure reason i have

  treated this question synthetically by making inquiries into pure reason itself and

  endeavoring in this source to determine the elements as well as the laws of its pure

  use according to principles the task is difficult and requires a resolute reader to

  penetrate by degrees into a system based on no data except reason itself and which

  therefore seeks without resting upon any fact to unfold knowledge from its original

  germs prolegomena however are designed for preparatory

  exercises they are intended rather to point out what we have to do in order if

  possible to actualise a science than to propound it they must therefore rest upon

  something already known as trustworthy from which we can set out with confidence and

  ascend to sources as yet unknown the discovery of which will not only explain to us

  what we knew but exhibit a sphere of many cognitions which all spring from the same

  sources the method of prolegomena especially of those

  designed as a preparation for future metaphysics is consequently analytical
but it happens fortunately that though we cannot assume

  metaphysics to be an actual science we can say with confidence that certain pure

  a priori synthetical cognitions pure mathematics and pure

  physics are actual and given for both contain propositions which are thoroughly

  recognised as apodeictically certain partly by mere reason partly by general consent

  arising from experience and yet as independent of experience we have therefore some

  at least uncontested synthetical knowledge a priori and need

  not ask whether it be possible for it is actual but

  how it is possible in order that we may deduce from the

  principle which makes the given cognitions possible the possibility of all the

  rest
the general problem how is cognition from pure reason possible
 5  we have above learned the significant distinction

  between analytical and synthetical judgments the possibility of analytical

  propositions was easily comprehended being entirely founded on the law of

  contradiction the possibility of synthetical a posteriori

  judgments of those which are gathered from experience also requires no particular

  explanation for experience is nothing but a continual synthesis of perceptions there

  remain therefore only synthetical propositions a priori of

  which the possibility must be sought or investigated because they must depend upon

  other principles than the law of contradiction
but here we need not first establish the possibility of such

  propositions so as to ask whether they are possible for there are enough of them which

  indeed are of undoubted certainty and as our present method is analytical we shall

  start from the fact that such synthetical but purely rational cognition actually

  exists but we must now inquire into the reason of this possibility and ask

  how such cognition is possible in order that we may from the

  principles of its possibility be enabled to determine the conditions of its use its

  sphere and its limits the proper problem upon which all depends when expressed with

  scholastic precision is therefore
how are synthetic propositions a priori possible


    for the sake of popularity i have above expressed this problem somewhat differently

    as an inquiry into purely rational cognition which i could do for once without

    detriment to the desired comprehension because as we have only to do here with

    metaphysics and its sources the reader will i hope after the fore going remarks

    keep in mind that when we speak of purely rational cognition we do not mean

    analytical but synthetical cognition9

metaphysics stands or falls with the solution of this problem its

  very existence depends upon it let any one make metaphysical assertions with ever so

  much plausibility let him overwhelm us with conclusions if he has not previously

  proved able to answer this question satisfactorily i have a right to say this is all

  vain baseless philosophy and false wisdom you speak through pure reason and claim as

  it were to create cognitions a priori by not only dissecting

  given concepts but also by asserting connexions which do not rest upon the law of

  contradiction and which you believe you conceive quite independently of all

  experience how do you arrive at this and how will you justify your pretensions an

  appeal to the consent of the common sense of mankind cannot be allowed for that is a

  witness whose authority depends merely upon rumor says horace
quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi
to all that which thou provest me thus i refuse to give

  credence
the answer to this question though indispensable is difficult

  and though the principal reason that it was not made long ago is that the possibility

  of the question never occurred to anybody there is yet another reason which is this

  that a satisfactory answer to this one question requires a much more persistent

  profound and painstaking reflexion than the most diffuse work on metaphysics which

  on its first appearance promised immortality to its author and every intelligent

  reader when he carefully reflects what this problem requires must at first be struck

  with its difficulty and would regard it as insoluble and even impossible did there

  not actually exist pure synthetical cognitions a priori this

  actually happened to david hume though he did not conceive the question in its entire

  universality as is done here and as must be done should the answer be decisive for

  all metaphysics for how is it possible says that acute man that when a concept is

  given me i can go beyond it and connect with it another which is not contained in it

  in such a manner as if the latter necessarily belonged to the former nothing but

  experience can furnish us with such connexions thus he concluded from the difficulty

  which he took to be an impossibility and all that vaunted necessity or what is the

  same thing all cognition assumed to be a priori is nothing

  but a long habit of accepting something as true and hence of mistaking subjective

  necessity for objective
should my reader complain of the difficulty and the trouble which i

  occasion him in the solution of this problem he is at liberty to solve it himself in

  an easier way perhaps he will then feel under obligation to the person who has

  undertaken for him a labor of so profound research and will rather be surprised at the

  facility with which considering the nature of the subject the solution has been

  attained yet it has cost years of work to solve the problem in its whole universality

  using the term in the mathematical sense viz for that which is sufficient for all

  cases and finally to exhibit it in the analytical form as the reader finds it

  here
all metaphysicians are therefore solemnly and legally suspended

  from their occupations till they shall have answered in a satisfactory manner the

  question how are synthetic cognitions a priori possible for

  the answer contains which they must show when they have anything to offer in the name

  of pure reason but if they do not possess these credentials they can expect nothing

  else of reasonable people who have been deceived so often than to be dismissed

  without further ado
if they on the other hand desire to carry on their business not as

  a science but as an art of wholesome oratory suited to the common sense of man they

  cannot in justice be prevented they will then speak the modest language of a rational

  belief they will grant that they are not allowed even to conjecture far less to know

  anything which lies beyond the bounds of all possible experience but only to assume

  not for speculative use which they must abandon but for practical purposes only the

  existence of something that is possible and even indispensable for the guidance of the

  understanding and of the will in life in this manner alone can they be called useful

  and wise men and the more so as they renounce the title of metaphysicians for the

  latter profess to be speculative philosophers and since when judgments a priori are under discussion poor probabilities cannot be admitted for

  what is declared to be known a priori is thereby announced as

  necessary such men cannot be permitted to play with conjectures but their assertions

  must be either science or are worth nothing at all
it may be said that the entire transcendental philosophy which

  necessarily precedes all metaphysics is nothing but the complete solution of the

  problem here propounded in systematical order and completeness and hitherto we have

  never had any transcendental philosophy for what goes by its name is properly a part

  of metaphysics whereas the former science is intended first to constitute the

  possibility of the latter and must therefore precede all metaphysics and it is not

  surprising that when a whole science deprived of all help from other sciences and

  consequently in itself quite new is required to answer a single question

  satisfactorily we should find the answer troublesome and difficult nay even shrouded

  in obscurity
as we now proceed to this solution according to the analytical

  method in which we assume that such cognitions from pure reasons actually exist we

  can only appeal to two sciences of theoretical cognition which alone is under

  consideration here pure mathematics and pure natural science physics for these

  alone can exhibit to us objects in a definite and actualisable form in der anschauung and consequently if there should occur in them a

  cognition a priori can show the truth or conformity of the

  cognition to the object in concreto that is its actuality

  from which we could proceed to the reason of its possibility by the analytic method

  this facilitates our work greatly for here universal considerations are not only

  applied to facts but even start from them while in a synthetic procedure they must

  strictly be derived in abstracto from concepts
but in order to rise from these actual and at the same time

  wellgrounded pure cognitions a priori to such a possible

  cognition of the same as we are seeking viz to metaphysics as a science we must

  comprehend that which occasions it i mean the mere natural though in spite of its

  truth not unsuspected cognition a priori which lies at the

  bottom of that science the elaboration of which without any critical investigation of

  its possibility is commonly called metaphysics in a word we must comprehend the

  natural conditions of such a science as a part of our inquiry and thus the

  transcendental problem will be gradually answered by a division into four

  questions
1  how is pure mathematics

  possible
2  how is pure natural science

  possible
3  how is metaphysics in general

  possible
4  how is metaphysics as a science

  possible
it may be seen that the solution of these problems though chiefly

  designed to exhibit the essential matter of the critique has yet something peculiar

  which for itself alone deserves attention this is the search for the sources of given

  sciences in reason itself so that its faculty of knowing something a

  priori may by its own deeds be investigated and measured by this procedure

  these sciences gain if not with regard to their contents yet as to their proper use

  and while they throw light on the higher question concerning their common origin they

  give at the same time an occasion better to explain their own nature
first

  part of the transcendental problem
how is pure mathematics possible
 6
here is a great and established branch of knowledge encompassing

  even now a wonderfully large domain and promising an unlimited extension in the future

  yet it carries with it thoroughly apodeictical certainty ie absolute necessity

  which therefore rests upon no empirical grounds consequently it is a pure product of

  reason and moreover is thoroughly synthetical here the question arises
how then is it possible for human reason to produce a cognition of

  this nature entirely a priori
does not this faculty which produces mathematics as it neither

  is nor can be based upon experience presuppose some ground of cognition a priori which lies deeply hidden but which might reveal itself by these

  its effects if their first beginnings were but diligently ferreted out
 7  but we find that all mathematical cognition has this

  peculiarity it must first exhibit its concept in a visual form anschauung and indeed a priori therefore in a

  visual form which is not empirical but pure without this mathematics cannot take a

  single step hence its judgments are always visual viz intuitive whereas

  philosophy must be satisfied with discursive judgments from mere concepts and though

  it may illustrate its doctrines through a visual figure can never derive them from it

  this observation on the nature of mathematics gives us a clue to the first and highest

  condition of its possibility which is that some nonsensuous visualisation called

  pure intuition or reine anschauung must form its basis in

  which all its concepts can be exhibited or constructed in

  concreto and yet a priori if we can find out this pure

  intuition and its possibility we may thence easily explain how synthetical

  propositions a priori are possible in pure mathematics and

  consequently how this science itself is possible empirical intuition viz

  senseperception enables us without difficulty to enlarge the concept which we frame

  of an object of intuition or senseperception by new predicates which intuition

  ie senseperception itself presents synthetically in experience pure intuition

  viz the visualisation of forms in our imagination from which every thing sensual

  ie every thought of material qualities is excluded does so likewise only with

  this difference that in the latter case the synthetical judgment is a

  priori certain and apodeictical in the former only a

  posteriori and empirically certain because this latter contains only that which

  occurs in contingent empirical intuition but the former that which must necessarily

  be discovered in pure intuition here intuition being an intuition a

  priori is before all experience viz before any

  perception of particular objects inseparably conjoined with its concept
 8  but with this step our perplexity seems rather to

  increase than to lessen for the question now is how is it possible to intuite in a

  visual form anything a priori an intuition viz a visual

  senseperception is such a representation as immediately depends upon the presence of

  the object hence it seems impossible to intuite from the outset a

  priori because intuition would in that event take place without either a former

  or a present object to refer to and by consequence could not be intuition concepts

  indeed are such that we can easily form some of them a priori

  viz such as contain nothing but the thought of an object in general and we need not

  find ourselves in an immediate relation to the object take for instance the concepts

  of quantity of cause etc but even these require in order to make them under stood

  a certain concrete usethat is an application to some senseexperience anschauung by which an object of them is given us but how can the

  intuition of the object its visualisation precede the object itself
 9  if our intuition ie our senseexperience were

  perforce of such a nature as to represent things as they are in themselves there would

  not be any intuition a priori but intuition would be always

  empirical for i can only know what is contained in the object in itself when it is

  present and given to me it is indeed even then incomprehensible how the visualising

  anschauung of a present thing should make me know this thing

  as it is in itself as its properties cannot migrate into my faculty of representation

  but even granting this possibility a visualising of that sort would not take place

  a priori that is before the object were presented to me for

  without this latter fact no reason of a relation between my representation and the

  object can be imagined unless it depend upon a direct inspiration
therefore in one way only can my intuition anschauung anticipate the actuality of the object and be a cognition

  a priori viz if my intuition contains nothing but the form

  of sensibility antedating in my subjectivity all the actual impressions through which

  i am affected by objects


    for that objects of sense can only be intuited according to this form of sensibility

    i can know a priori  hence it follows that

    propositions which concern this form of sensuous intuition only are possible and

    valid for objects of the senses as also conversely that intuitions which are

    possible a priori can never concern any other things than

    objects of our senses10
 10  accordingly it is only the form of the sensuous

  intuition by which we can intuite things a priori but by which

  we can know objects only as they appear to us to our senses

  not as they are in themselves and this assumption is absolutely necessary if

  synthetical propositions a priori be granted as possible or

  if in case they actually occur their possibility is to be comprehended and determined

  beforehand
now the intuitions which pure mathematics lays at the foundation

  of all its cognitions and judgments which appear at once apodeictic and necessary are

  space and time for mathematics must first have all its concepts in intuition and pure

  mathematics in pure intuition that is it must construct them if it proceeded in any

  other way it would be impossible to make any headway for mathematics proceeds not

  analytically by dissection of concepts but synthetically and if pure intuition be

  wanting there is nothing in which the matter for synthetical judgments a priori can be given geometry is based upon the pure intuition of space

  arithmetic accomplishes its concept of number by the successive addition of units in

  time and pure mechanics especially cannot attain its concepts of motion without

  employing the representation of time both representations however are only

  intuitions for if we omit from the empirical intuitions of bodies and their

  alterations motion everything empirical or belonging to sensation space and time

  still remain which are therefore pure intuitions that lie a

  priori at the basis of the empirical hence they can never be omitted but at

  the same time by their being pure intuitions a priori they

  prove that they are mere forms of our sensibility which must precede all empirical

  intuition or perception of actual objects and conformably to which objects can be

  known a priori but only as they appear to us
 11  the problem of the present section is therefore solved

  pure mathematics as synthetical cognition a priori is only

  possible by referring to no other objects than those of the senses at the basis of

  their empirical intuition lies a pure intuition of space and of time which is

  a priori this is possible because the latter intuition is

  nothing but the mere form of sensibility which precedes the actual appearance of the

  objects in that it in fact makes them possible yet this faculty of intuiting

  a priori affects not the matter of the phenomenon that is the

  senseelement in it for this constitutes that which is empirical but its form viz

  space and time should any man venture to doubt that these are determinations adhering

  not to things in themselves but to their relation to our sensibility i should be glad

  to know how it can be possible to know the constitution of things a

  priori viz before we have any acquaintance with them and before they are

  presented to us such however is the case with space and time but this is quite

  comprehensible as soon as both count for nothing more than formal conditions of our

  sensibility while the objects count merely as phenomena for then the form of the

  phenomenon ie pure intuition can by all means be represented as proceeding from

  ourselves that is a priori
 12  in order to add something by way of illustration and

  confirmation we need only watch the ordinary and necessary procedure of geometers all

  proofs of the complete congruence of two given figures where the one can in every

  respect be substituted for the other come ultimately to this that they may be made to

  coincide which is evidently nothing else than a synthetical proposition resting upon

  immediate intuition and this intuition must be pure or given a

  priori otherwise the proposition could not rank as apodeictically certain but

  would have empirical certainty only in that case it could only be said that it is

  always found to be so and holds good only as far as our perception reaches that

  everywhere space which in its entirety is itself no longer the boundary of another

  space has three dimensions and that space cannot in any way have more is based on

  the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one

  point but this proposition cannot by any means be shown from concepts but rests

  immediately on intuition and indeed on pure and a priori

  intuition because it is apodeictically certain that we can require a line to be drawn

  to infinity in indefinitum or that a series of changes for

  example spaces traversed by motion shall be infinitely continued presupposes a

  representation of space and time which can only attach to intuition namely so far as

  it in itself is bounded by nothing for from concepts it could never be inferred

  consequently the basis of mathematics actually are pure intuitions which make its

  synthetical and apodeictically valid propositions possible hence our transcendental

  deduction of the notions of space and of time explains at the same time the possibility

  of pure mathematics without some such deduction its truth may be granted but its

  existence could by no means be understood and we must assume that everything which

  can be given to our senses to the external senses in space to the internal one in

  time is intuited by us as it appears to us not as it is in itself
 13  those who cannot yet rid themselves of the notion that

  space and time are actual qualities inhering in things in themselves may exercise

  their acumen on the following paradox when they have in vain attempted its solution

  and are free from prejudices at least for a few moments they will suspect that the

  degradation of space and of time to mere forms of our sensuous intuition may perhaps be

  well founded
if two things are quite equal in all respects as much as can be

  ascertained by all means possible quantitatively and qualitatively it must follow

  that the one can in all cases and under all circumstances replace the other and this

  substitution would not occasion the least perceptible difference this in fact is true

  of plane figures in geometry but some spherical figures exhibit notwithstanding a

  complete internal agreement such a contrast in their external relation that the one

  figure cannot possibly be put in the place of the other for instance two spherical

  triangles on opposite hemispheres which have an arc of the equator as their common

  base may be quite equal both as regards sides and angles so that nothing is to be

  found in either if it be described for itself alone and completed that would not

  equally be applicable to both and yet the one cannot be put in the place of the other

  being situated upon the opposite hemisphere here then is an internal difference

  between the two triangles which difference our understanding cannot describe as

  internal and which only manifests itself by external relations in space
but i shall adduce examples taken from common life that are more

  obvious still
what can be more similar in every respect and in every part more

  alike to my hand and to my ear than their images in a mirror and yet i cannot put

  such a hand as is seen in the glass in the place of its archetype for if this is a

  right hand that in the glass is a left one and the image or reflexion of the right

  ear is a left one which never can serve as a substitute for the other there are in

  this case no internal differences which our understanding could determine by thinking

  alone yet the differences are internal as the senses teach for notwithstanding their

  complete equality and similarity the left hand cannot be enclosed in the same bounds

  as the right one they are not congruent the glove of one hand cannot be used for the

  other what is the solution these objects are not representations of things as they

  are in themselves and as the pure understanding would cognise them but sensuous

  intuitions that is appearances the possibility of which rests upon the relation of

  certain things unknown in themselves to something else viz to our sensibility space

  is the form of the external intuition of this sensibility and the internal

  determination of every space is only possible by the determination of its external

  relation to the whole space of which it is a part in other words by its relation to

  the external sense that is to say the part is only possible through the whole which

  is never the case with things in themselves as objects of the mere understanding but

  with appearances only hence the difference between similar and equal things which are

  yet not congruent for instance two symmetric helices cannot be made intelligible by

  any concept but only by the relation to the right and the left hands which immediately

  refers to intuition
remark i
pure mathematics and especially pure geometry can only have

  objective reality on condition that they refer to objects of sense but in regard to

  the latter the principle holds good that our sense representation is not a

  representation of things in themselves but of the way in which they appear to us

  hence it follows that the propositions of geometry are not the results of a mere

  creation of our poetic imagination and that therefore they cannot be referred with

  assurance to actual objects but rather that they are necessarily valid of space and

  consequently of all that may be found in space because space is nothing else than the

  form of all external appearances and it is this form alone in which objects of sense

  can be given sensibility the form of which is the basis of geometry is that upon

  which the possibility of external appearance depends therefore these appearances can

  never contain anything but what geometry prescribes to them
it would be quite otherwise if the senses were so constituted as to

  represent objects as they are in themselves for then it would not by any means follow

  from the conception of space which with all its properties serves to the geometer as

  an a priori foundation together with what is thence inferred

  must be so in nature the space of the geometer would be considered a mere fiction and

  it would not be credited with objective validity because we cannot see how things must

  of necessity agree with an image of them which we make spontaneously and previous to

  our acquaintance with them but if this image or rather this formal intuition is the

  essential property of our sensibility by means of which alone objects are given to us

  and if this sensibility represents not things in themselves but their appearances we

  shall easily comprehend and at the same time indisputably prove that all external

  objects of our world of sense must necessarily coincide in the most rigorous way with

  the propositions of geometry because sensibility by means of its form of external

  intuition viz by space the same with which the geometer is occupied makes those

  objects at all possible as mere appearances
it will always remain a remarkable phenomenon in the history of

  philosophy that there was a time when even mathematicians who at the same time were

  philosophers began to doubt not of the accuracy of their geometrical propositions so

  far as they concerned space but of their objective validity and the applicability of

  this concept itself and of all its corollaries to nature they showed much concern

  whether a line in nature might not consist of physical points and consequently that

  true space in the object might consist of simple discrete parts while the space

  which the geometer has in his mind being continuous cannot be such they did not

  recognise that this mental space renders possible the physical space ie the

  extension of matter that this pure space is not at all a quality of things in

  themselves but a form of our sensuous faculty of representation and that all objects

  in space are mere appearances ie not things in themselves but representations of

  our sensuous intuition but such is the case for the space of the geometer is exactly

  the form of sensuous intuition which we find a priori in us

  and contains the ground of the possibility of all external appearances according to

  their form and the latter must necessarily and most rigidly agree with the

  propositions of the geometer which he draws not from any fictitious concept but from

  the subjective basis of all external phenomena which is sensibility itself in this

  and no other way can geometry be made secure as to the undoubted objective reality of

  its propositions against all the intrigues of a shallow metaphysics which is surprised

  at them the geometrical propositions because it has not traced them to the sources

  of their concepts
remark ii
whatever is given us as object must be given us in intuition all

  our intuition however takes place by means of the senses only the understanding

  intuites nothing but only reflects and as we have just shown that the senses never

  and in no manner enable us to know things in themselves but only their appearances

  which are mere representations of the sensibility we conclude that all bodies

  together with the space in which they are must be considered nothing but mere

  representations in us and exist nowhere but in our thoughts you will say is not

  this manifest idealism
idealism consists in the assertion that there are none but

  thinking beings all other things which we think are perceived in intuition being

  nothing but representations in the thinking beings to which no object external to them

  corresponds in fact whereas i say that things as objects of our senses existing

  outside us are given but we know nothing of what they may be in themselves knowing

  only their appearances ie the representations which they cause in us by affecting

  our senses consequently i grant by all means that there are bodies without us that

  is things which though quite unknown to us as to what they are in themselves we yet

  know by the representations which their influence on our sensibility procures us and

  which we call bodies a term signifying merely the appearance of the thing which is

  unknown to us but not therefore less actual can this be termed idealism it is the

  very contrary
long before lockes time but assuredly since him it has been

  generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external

  things that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in

  themselves but to their appearances and to have no proper existence outside our

  representation heat color and taste for instance are of this kind now if i go

  farther and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of

  bodies also which are called primary such as extension place and in general space

  with all that which belongs to it impenetrability or materiality space etcno one

  in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible as little as the man who

  admits colors not to be properties of the object in itself but only as modifications

  of the sense of sight should on that account be called an idealist so little can my

  system be named idealistic merely because i find that more nay
all the properties which constitute the intuition

  of a body belong merely to its appearance
the existence of the thing that appears is thereby not destroyed

  as in genuine idealism but it is only shown that we cannot possibly know it by the

  senses as it is in itself
i should be glad to know what my assertions must be in order to

  avoid all idealism undoubtedly i should say that the representation of space is not

  only perfectly conformable to the relation which our sensibility has to objectsthat i

  have saidbut that it is quite similar to the objectan assertion in which i can find

  as little meaning as if i said that the sensation of red has a similarity to the

  property of vermilion which in me excites this sensation
remark iii
hence we may at once dismiss an easily foreseen but futile

  objection that by admitting the ideality of space and of time the whole sensible

  world would be turned into mere sham at first all philosophical insight into the

  nature of sensuous cognition was spoiled by making the sensibility merely a confused

  mode of representation according to which we still know things as they are but

  without being able to reduce everything in this our representation to a clear

  consciousness whereas proof is offered by us that sensibility consists not in this

  logical distinction of clearness and obscurity but in the genetical one of the origin

  of cognition itself for sensuous perception represents things not at all as they are

  but only the mode in which they affect our senses and consequently by sensuous

  perception appearances only and not things themselves are given to the understanding

  for reflexion after this necessary corrective an objection rises from an unpardonable

  and almost intentional misconception as if my doctrine turned all the things of the

  world of sense into mere illusion
when an appearance is given us we are still quite free as to how

  we should judge the matter the appearance depends upon the senses but the judgment

  upon the understanding and the only question is whether in the determination of the

  object there is truth or not but the difference between truth and dreaming is not

  ascertained by the nature of the representations which are referred to objects for

  they are the same in both cases but by their connexion according to those rules

  which determine the coherence of the representations in the concept of an object and

  by ascertaining whether they can subsist together in experience or not and it is not

  the fault of the appearances if our cognition takes illusion for truth ie if the

  intuition by which an object is given us is considered a concept of the thing or of

  its existence also which the understanding can only think the senses represent to us

  the paths of the planets as now progressive now retrogressive and herein is neither

  falsehood nor truth because as long as we hold this path to be nothing but appearance

  we do not judge of the objective nature of their motion but as a false judgment may

  easily arise when the understanding is not on its guard against this subjective mode of

  representation being considered objective we say they appear to move backward it is

  not the senses however which must be charged with the illusion but the understanding

  whose province alone it is to give an objective judgment on appearances
thus even if we did not at all reflect on the origin of our

  representations whenever we connect our intuitions of sense whatever they may

  contain in space and in time according to the rules of the coherence of all

  cognition in experience illusion or truth will arise according as we are negligent or

  careful it is merely a question of the use of sensuous representations in the

  understanding and not of their origin in the same way if i consider all the

  representations of the senses together with their form space and time to be nothing

  but appearances and space and time to be a mere form of the sensibility which is not

  to be met with in objects out of it and if i make use of these representations in

  reference to possible experience only there is nothing in my regarding them as

  appearances that can lead astray or cause illusion for all that they can correctly

  cohere according to rules of truth in experience thus all the propositions of geometry

  hold good of space as well as of all the objects of the senses consequently of all

  possible experience whether i consider space as a mere form of the sensibility or as

  something cleaving to the things themselves in the former case however i comprehend

  how i can know a priori these propositions concerning all the

  objects of external intuition otherwise everything else as regards all possible

  experience remains just as if i had not departed from the vulgar view
but if i venture to go beyond all possible experience with my

  notions of space and time which i cannot refrain from doing if i proclaim them

  qualities inherent in things in themselves for what should prevent me from letting

  them hold good of the same things even though my senses might be different and

  unsuited to them then a grave error may arise due to illusion for thus i would

  proclaim to be universally valid what is merely a subjective condition of the intuition

  of things and sure only for all objects of sense viz for all possible experience i

  would refer this condition to things in themselves and do not limit it to the

  conditions of experience
my doctrine of the ideality of space and of time therefore far

  from reducing the whole sensible world to mere illusion is the only means of securing

  the application of one of the most important cognitions that which mathematics

  propounds a priori to actual objects and of preventing its

  being regarded as mere illusion for without this observation it would be quite

  impossible to make out whether the intuitions of space and time which we borrow from

  no experience and which yet lie in our representation a

  priori are not mere phantasms of our brain to which objects do not correspond

  at least not adequately and consequently whether we have been able to show its

  unquestionable validity with regard to all the objects of the sensible world just

  because they are mere appearances
secondly though these my principles make appearances of the

  representations of the senses they are so far from turning the truth of experience

  into mere illusion that they are rather the only means of preventing the

  transcendental illusion by which metaphysics has hitherto been deceived leading to

  the childish endeavor of catching at bubbles because appearances which are mere

  representations were taken for things in themselves here originated the remarkable

  event of the antimony of reason which i shall mention by and by and which is destroyed

  by the single observation that appearance as long as it is employed in experience

  produces truth but the moment it transgresses the bounds of experience and

  consequently becomes transcendent produces nothing but illusion
inasmuch therefore as i leave to things as we obtain them by the

  senses their actuality and only limit our sensuous intuition of these things to this

  that they represent in no respect not even in the pure intuitions of space and of

  time anything more than mere appearance of those things but never their constitution

  in themselves this is not a sweeping illusion invented for nature by me my

  protestation too against all charges of idealism is so valid and clear as even to seem

  superfluous were there not incompetent judges who while they would have an old name

  for every deviation from their perverse though common opinion and never judge of the

  spirit of philosophic nomenclature but cling to the letter only are ready to put

  their own conceits in the place of welldefined notions and thereby deform and distort

  them i have myself given this my theory the name of transcendental idealism but that

  cannot authorise any one to confound it either with the empirical idealism of

  descartes indeed his was only an insoluble problem owing to which he thought every

  one at liberty to deny the existence of the corporeal world because it could never be

  proved satisfactorily or with the mystical and visionary idealism of berkeley

  against which and other similar phantasms our critique contains the proper antidote my

  idealism concerns not the existence of things the doubting of which however

  constitutes idealism in the ordinary sense since it never came into my head to doubt

  it but it concerns the sensuous representation of things to which space and time

  especially belong of these viz space and time consequently of all appearances in

  general i have only shown that they are neither things but mere modes of

  representation nor determinations belonging to things in themselves but the word

  transcendental which with me means a reference of our cognition ie not to

  things but only to the cognitive faculty was meant to obviate this misconception yet

  rather than give further occasion to it by this word i now retract it and desire this

  idealism of mine to be called critical but if it be really an objectionable idealism

  to convert actual things not appearances into mere representations by what name

  shall we call him who conversely changes mere representations to things it may i

  think be called dreaming idealism in contradistinction to the former which may be

  called visionary both of which are to be refuted by my transcendental or better

  critical idealism
second

  part of the transcendental problem
how is the science of nature possible
 14
nature is the existence of things so far as it is determined

  according to universal laws should nature signify the existence of things in

  themselves we could never cognise it either a priori or

  a posteriori not a priori for how can

  we know what belongs to things in themselves since this never can be done by the

  dissection of our concepts in analytical judgments we do not want to know what is

  contained in our concept of a thing for the concept describes what belongs to its

  logical being but what is in the actuality of the thing superadded to our concept

  and by what the thing itself is determined in its existence outside the concept our

  understanding and the conditions on which alone it can connect the determinations of

  things in their existence do not prescribe any rule to things themselves these do not

  conform to our understanding but it must conform itself to them they must therefore

  be first given us in order to gather these determinations from them wherefore they

  would not be cognised a priori
a cognition of the nature of things in themselves a posteriori would be equally impossible for if experience is to teach us

  laws to which the existence of things is subject these laws if they regard things in

  themselves must belong to them of necessity even outside our experience but

  experience teaches us what exists and how it exists but never that it must necessarily

  exist so and not otherwise experience therefore can never teach us the nature of

  things in themselves
 15  we nevertheless actually possess a pure science of

  nature in which are propounded a priori and with all the

  necessity requisite to apodeictical propositions laws to which nature is subject i

  need only call to witness that propaedeutic of natural science which under the title

  of the universal science of nature precedes all physics which is founded upon

  empirical principles in it we have mathematics applied to appearance and also merely

  discursive principles or those derived from concepts which constitute the

  philosophical part of the pure cognition of nature but there are several things in it

  which are not quite pure and independent of empirical sources such as the concept of

  motion that of impenetrability upon

  which the empirical concept of matter rests that of inertia

  and many others which prevent its being called a perfectly pure science of nature

  besides it only refers to objects of the external sense and therefore does not give

  an example of a universal science of nature in the strict sense for such a science

  must reduce nature in general whether it regards the object of the external or that of

  the internal sense the object of physics as well as psychology to universal laws

  but among the principles of this universal physics there are a few which actually have

  the required universality for instance the propositions that substance is

  permanent and that every event is determined by a cause according to constant laws

  etc these are actually universal laws of nature which subsist completely a priori there is then in fact a pure science of nature and the question

  arises how is it possible
 16  the word nature assumes yet another meaning which

  determines the object whereas in the former sense it only denotes the conformity to

  law gesetzmssigkeit of the determinations of the existence of things generally if we

  consider it materialiter ie in the matter that forms its

  objects nature is the complex of all the objects of experience and with this only

  are we now concerned for besides things which can never be objects of experience if

  they must be cognised as to their nature would oblige us to have recourse to concepts

  whose meaning could never be given in concreto by any example

  of possible experience consequently we must form for ourselves a list of concepts of

  their nature the reality whereof ie whether they actually refer to objects or are

  mere creations of thought could never be determined the cognition of what cannot be

  an object of experience would be hyperphysical and with things hyperphysical we are

  here not concerned but only with the cognition of nature the actuality of which can

  be confirmed by experience though it the cognition of nature is possible

  a priori and precedes all experience
 17  the formal aspect of nature in this narrower sense is

  therefore the conformity to law of all the objects of experience and so far as it is

  cognised a priori their necessary conformity but it has just

  been shown that the laws of nature can never be cognised a priori in objects so far as

  they are considered not in reference to possible experience but as things in

  themselves and our inquiry here extends not to things in themselves the properties of

  which we pass by but to things as objects of possible experience and the complex of

  these is what we properly designate as nature and now i ask when the possibility of a

  cognition of nature a priori is in question whether it is

  better to arrange the problem thus how can we cognise a priori

  that things as objects of experience necessarily conform to law or thus how is it

  possible to cognise a priori the necessary conformity to law of

  experience itself as regards all its objects generally
closely considered the solution of the problem represented in

  either way amounts with regard to the pure cognition of nature which is the point of

  the question at issue entirely to the same thing for the subjective laws under

  which alone an empirical cognition of things is possible hold good of these things as

  objects of possible experience not as things in themselves which are not considered

  here either of the following statements means quite the same
a judgment of observation can never rank as experience without the

  law that whenever an event is observed it is always referred to some antecedent

  which it follows according to a universal rule
everything of which experience teaches that it happens must have

  a cause
it is however more commendable to choose the first formula for

  we can a priori and previous to all given objects have a

  cognition of those conditions on which alone experience is possible but never of the

  laws to which things may in themselves be subject without reference to possible

  experience we cannot therefore study the nature of things a

  priori otherwise than by investigating the conditions and the universal though

  subjective laws under which alone such a cognition as experience as to mere form is

  possible and we determine accordingly the possibility of things as objects of

  experience for if i should choose the second formula and seek the conditions

  a priori on which nature as an object of experience is

  possible i might easily fall into error and fancy that i was speaking of nature as a

  thing in itself and then move round in endless circles in a vain search for laws

  concerning things of which nothing is given me
accordingly we shall here be concerned with experience only and

  the universal conditions of its possibility which are given a

  priori thence we shall determine nature as the whole object of all possible

  experience i think it will be understood that i here do not mean the rules of the

  observation of a nature that is already given for these already presuppose experience

  i do not mean how through experience we can study the laws of nature for these would

  not then be laws a priori and would yield us no pure science

  of nature but i mean to ask how the conditions a priori of

  the possibility of experience are at the same time the sources from which all the

  universal laws of nature must be derived


     18  in the first place we must state that while all judgments of experience

    erfahrungsurtheile are empirical ie have their ground

    in immediate sense perception vice versa all empirical

    judgments empirische urtheile are not judgments of

    experience but besides the empirical and in general besides what is given to the

    sensuous intuition particular concepts must yet be superaddedconcepts which have

    their origin quite a priori in the pure understanding and

    under which every perception must be first of all subsumed and then by their means

    changed into experience11

empirical judgments so far as they have objective validity are

  judgments of experience but those which are only subjectively

  valid i name mere judgments of perception the latter require

  no pure concept of the understanding but only the logical connexion of perception in a

  thinking subject but the former always require besides the representation of the

  sensuous intuition particular concepts originally begotten in the

  understanding which produce the objective validity of the judgment of

  experience
all our judgments are at first merely judgments of perception they

  hold good only for us ie for our subject and we do not till afterwards give them

  a new reference to an object and desire that they shall always hold good for us and

  in the same way for everybody else for when a judgment agrees with an object all

  judgments concerning the same object must likewise agree among themselves and thus the

  objective validity of the judgment of experience signifies nothing else than its

  necessary universality of application and conversely when we have reason to consider a

  judgment necessarily universal which never depends upon perception but upon the pure

  concept of the understanding under which the perception is subsumed we must consider

  it objective also that is that it expresses not merely a reference of our perception

  to a subject but a quality of the object for there would be no reason for the

  judgments of other men necessarily agreeing with mine if it were not the unity of the

  object to which they all refer and with which they accord hence they must all agree

  with one another
 19  therefore objective validity and necessary universality

  for everybody are equivalent terms and though we do not know the object in itself

  yet when we consider a judgment as universal and also necessary we understand it to

  have objective validity by this judgment we cognise the object though it remains

  unknown as it is in itself by the universal and necessary connexion of the given

  perceptions as this is the case with all objects of sense judgments of experience

  take their objective validity not from the immediate cognition of the object which is

  impossible but from the condition of universal validity in empirical judgments

  which as already said never rests upon empirical or in short sensuous conditions

  but upon a pure concept of the understanding the object always remains unknown in

  itself but when by the concept of the understanding the connexion of the

  representations of the object which are given to our sensibility is determined as

  universally valid the object is determined by this relation and it is the judgment

  that is objective


    to illustrate the matter when we say the room is warm sugar sweet and wormwood

    bitter12we have only subjectively valid

    judgments i do not at all expect that i or any other person shall always find it as

    i now do each of these sentences only expresses a relation of two sensations to the

    same subject to myself and that only in my present state of perception

    consequently they are not valid of the object such are judgments of perception

    judgments of experience are of quite a different nature what experience teaches me

    under certain circumstances it must always teach me and everybody and its validity

    is not limited to the subject nor to its state at a particular time hence i

    pronounce all such judgments as being objectively valid for instance when i say the

    air is elastic this judgment is as yet a judgment of perception onlyi do nothing

    but refer two of my sensations to one another but if i would have it called a

    judgment of experience i require this connexion to stand under a condition which

    makes it universally valid i desire therefore that i and everybody else should

    always connect necessarily the same perceptions under the same circumstances

  
 20  we must consequently analyse experience in order to see

  what is contained in this product of the senses and of the understanding and how the

  judgment of experience itself is possible  the foundation is the intuition of

  which i become conscious ie perception perceptio which

  pertains merely to the senses but in the next place there are acts of judging which

  belong only to the understanding but this judging may be twofoldfirst i may merely

  compare perceptions and connect them in a particular state of my consciousness or

  secondly i may connect them in consciousness generally the former judgment is merely

  a judgment of perception and of subjective validity only it is merely a connexion of

  perceptions in my mental state without reference to the object hence it is not as is

  commonly imagined enough for experience to compare perceptions and to connect them in

  consciousness through judgment there arises no universality and necessity for which

  alone judgments can become objectively valid and be called experience
quite another judgment therefore is required before perception can

  become experience the given intuition must be subsumed under a concept which

  determines the form of judging in general relatively to the intuition connects its

  empirical consciousness in consciousness generally and thereby procures universal

  validity for empirical judgments a concept of this nature is a pure a

  priori concept of the understanding which does nothing but determine for an

  intuition the general way in which it can be used for judgments let the concept be

  that of cause then it determines the intuition which is subsumed under it eg that

  of air relative to judgments in general viz the concept of air serves with regard

  to its expansion in the relation of antecedent to consequent in a hypothetical

  judgment the concept of cause accordingly is a pure concept of the understanding

  which is totally disparate from all possible perception and only serves to determine

  the representation subsumed under it relatively to judgments in general and so to

  make a universally valid judgment possible


    before therefore a judgment of perception can become a judgment of experience it

    is requisite that the perception should be subsumed under some such a concept of the

    understanding for instance air ranks under the concept of causes which determines

    our judgment about it in regard to its expansion as hypothetical13 thereby the expansion of the air is

    represented not as merely belonging to the perception of the air in my present state

    or in several states of mine or in the state of perception of others but as

    belonging to it necessarily the judgment the air is elastic becomes universally

    valid and a judgment of experience only by certain judgments preceding it which

    subsume the intuition of air under the concept of cause and effect and they thereby

    determine the perceptions not merely as regards one another in me but relatively to

    the form of judging in general which is here hypothetical and in this way they

    render the empirical judgment universally valid

  


    if all our synthetical judgments are analysed so far as they are objectively valid

    it will be found that they never consist of mere intuitions connected only as is

    commonly believed by comparison into a judgment but that they would be impossible

    were not a pure concept of the understanding superadded to the concepts abstracted

    from intuition under which concept these latter are subsumed and in this manner

    only combined into an objectively valid judgment even the judgments of pure

    mathematics in their simplest axioms are not exempt from this condition the

    principle a straight line is the shortest between two points presupposes that the

    line is subsumed under the concept of quantity which certainly is no mere intuition

    but has its seat in the understanding alone and serves to determine the intuition

    of the line with regard to the judgments which may be made about it relatively to

    their quantity that is to plurality as judicia

    plurativa14 for under them it is understood that

    in a given intuition there is contained a plurality of homogenous parts

  
 21  to prove then the possibility of experience so far as

  it rests upon pure concepts of the understanding a priori we

  must first represent what belongs to judgments in general and the various functions of

  the understanding in a complete table for the pure concepts of the understanding must

  run parallel to these functions as such concepts are nothing more than concepts of

  intuitions in general so far as these are determined by one or other of these

  functions of judging in themselves that is necessarily and universally hereby also

  the a priori principles of the possibility of all experience

  as of an objectively valid empirical cognition will be precisely determined for they

  are nothing but propositions by which all perception is under certain universal

  conditions of intuition subsumed under those pure concepts of the understanding

analogies of experience
postulates of empirical thinking generally


 21a  in order to comprise the whole

  matter in one idea it is first necessary to remind the reader that we are discussing

  not the origin of experience but of that which lies in experience the former pertains

  to empirical psychology and would even then never be adequately explained without the

  latter which belongs to the critique of cognition and particularly of the

  understanding
experience consists of intuitions which belong to the sensibility

  and of judgments which are entirely a work of the understanding but the judgments

  which the understanding forms alone from sensuous intuitions are far from being

  judgments of experience for in the one case the judgment connects only the perceptions

  as they are given in the sensuous intuition while in the other the judgments must

  express what experience in general and not what the mere perception which possesses

  only subjective validity contains the judgment of experience must therefore add to

  the sensuous intuition and its logical connexion in a judgment after it has been

  rendered universal by comparison something that determines the synthetical judgment as

  necessary and therefore as universally valid this can be nothing else than that

  concept which represents the intuition as determined in itself with regard to one form

  of judgment rather than another viz a concept of that synthetical unity of

  intuitions which can only be represented by a given logical function of judgments


     22  the sum of the matter is this the business of the senses is to

    intuitethat of the understanding is to think but thinking is uniting

    representations in one consciousness this union originates either merely relative to

    the subject and is accidental and subjective or is absolute and is necessary or

    objective the union of representations in one consciousness is judgment thinking

    therefore is the same as judging or referring representations to judgments in

    general hence judgments are either merely subjective when representations are

    referred to a consciousness in one subject only and united in it or objective when

    they are united in a consciousness generally that is necessarily  the logical

    functions of all judgments are but various modes of uniting representations in

    consciousness but if they serve for concepts they are concepts of their necessary

    union in a consciousness and so principles of objectively valid judgments this

    union in a consciousness is either analytical by identity or synthetical by the

    combination and addition of various representations one to another experience

    consists in the synthetical connexion of phenomena perceptions in consciousness so

    far as this connexion is necessary hence the pure concepts of the understanding are

    those under which all perceptions must be subsumed ere they can serve for judgments

    of experience in which the synthetical unity of the perceptions is represented as

    necessary and universally valid15

 23  judgments when considered merely as the condition

  of the union of given representations in a consciousness are rules these rules so

  far as they represent the union as necessary are rules a

  priori and so far as they cannot be deduced from higher rules are fundamental

  principles but in regard to the possibility of all experience merely in relation to

  the form of thinking in it no conditions of judgments of experience are higher than

  those which bring the phenomena according to the various form of their intuition

  under pure concepts of the understanding and render the empirical judgment objectively

  valid these concepts are therefore the a priori principles of

  possible experience


    the principles of possible experience are then at the same time universal laws of

    nature which can be cognised a priori and thus the problem

    in our second question how is the pure science of nature possible is solved for

    the system which is required for the form of a science is to be met with in

    perfection here because beyond the abovementioned formal conditions of all

    judgments in general offered in logic no others are possible and these constitute a

    logical system the concepts grounded thereupon which contain the a

    priori conditions of all synthetical and necessary judgments accordingly

    constitute a transcendental system finally the principles by means of which all

    phenomena are subsumed under these concepts constitute a physical16 system that is a system of nature

    which precedes all empirical cognition of nature makes it even possible and hence

    may in strictness be denominated the universal and pure science of nature

  


     24  the first one17 of the physiological principles

    subsumes all phenomena as intuitions in space and time under the concept of

    quantity and is so far a principle of the application of mathematics to experience

    the second one subsumes the empirical element viz sensation which denotes the real

    in intuitions not indeed directly under the concept of quantity because sensation

    is not an intuition that contains either space or time though it places the

    respective object into both but still there is between reality

    senserepresentation and the zero or total void of intuition in time a difference

    which has a quantity for between every given degree of light and of darkness

    between every degree of heat and of absolute cold between every degree of weight and

    of absolute lightness between every degree of occupied space and of totally void

    space diminishing degrees can be conceived in the same manner as between

    consciousness and total unconsciousness the darkness of a psychological blank ever

    diminishing degrees obtain hence there is no perception that can prove an absolute

    absence of it for instance no psychological darkness that cannot be considered as a

    kind of consciousness this occurs in all cases of sensation and so the

    understanding can anticipate even sensations which constitute the peculiar quality

    of empirical representations appearances by means of the principle that they all

    have consequently that what is real in all phenomena has a degree here is the

    second application of mathematics mathesis intensorum to

    the science of nature

  


     25  anent the relation of appearances merely with a view to their existence

    the determination is not mathematical but dynamical and can never be objectively

    valid consequently never fit for experience if it does not come under a priori principles by which the cognition of experience relative to

    appearances becomes even possible hence appearances must be subsumed under the

    concept of substance which is the foundation of all determination of existence as a

    concept of the thing itself or secondlyso far as a succession is found among

    phenomena that is an eventunder the concept of an effect with reference to cause

    or lastlyso far as coexistence is to be known objectively that is by a judgment of

    experienceunder the concept of community action and reaction18 thus a priori principles form the

    basis of objectively valid though empirical judgments that is of the possibility

    of experience so far as it must connect objects as existing in nature these

    principles are the proper laws of nature which may be termed dynamical

  
finally the cognition of the agreement and connexion not only of

  appearances among themselves in experience but of their relation to experience in

  general belongs to the judgments of experience this relation contains either their

  agreement with the formal conditions which the understanding cognises or their

  coherence with the materials of the senses and of perception or combines both into one

  concept consequently it contains possibility actuality and necessity according to

  universal laws of nature and this constitutes the physical doctrine of method or the

  distinction of truth and of hypotheses and the bounds of the certainty of the

  latter
 26  the third table of principles drawn from the nature of

  the understanding itself after the critical method shows an inherent perfection which

  raises it far above every other table which has hitherto though in vain been tried or

  may yet be tried by analysing the objects themselves dogmatically it exhibits all

  synthetical a priori principles completely and according to one

  principle viz the faculty of judging in general constituting the essence of

  experience as regards the understanding so that we can be certain that there are no

  more such principles a satisfaction such as can never be attained by the dogmatical

  method yet is this not all there is a still greater merit in it
we must carefully bear in mind the proof which shows the

  possibility of this cognition a priori and at the same time

  limits all such principles to a condition which must never be lost sight of if we

  desire it not to be misunderstood and extended in use beyond the original sense which

  the understanding attaches to it this limit is that they contain nothing but the

  conditions of possible experience in general so far as it is subjected to laws

  a priori consequently i do not say that things in themselves possess a quantity that their actuality possesses a degree

  their existence a connexion of accidents in a substance etc this nobody can prove

  because such a synthetical connexion from mere concepts without any reference to

  sensuous intuition on the one side or connexion of it in a possible experience on the

  other is absolutely impossible the essential limitation of the concepts in these

  principles then is that all things stand necessarily a priori

  under the aforementioned conditions as objects of experience only


    hence there follows secondly a specifically peculiar mode of proof of these

    principles they are not directly referred to appearances and to their relations but

    to the possibility of experience of which appearances constitute the matter only

    not the form thus they are referred to objectively and universally valid synthetical

    propositions in which we distinguish judgments of experience from those of

    perception this takes place because appearances as mere intuitions occupying a

    part of space and time come under the concept of quantity which unites their

    multiplicity a priori according to rules synthetically

    again so far as the perception contains besides intuition sensibility and between

    the latter and nothing ie the total disappearance of sensibility there is an

    ever decreasing transition it is apparent that that which is in appearances must

    have a degree so far as it viz the perception does not itself occupy any part of

    space or of time19 still the transition to actuality

    from empty time or empty space is only possible in time consequently though

    sensibility as the quality of empirical intuition can never be cognised

    a priori by its specific difference from other

    sensibilities yet it can in a possible experience in general as a quantity of

    perception be intensely distinguished from every other similar perception hence the

    application of mathematics to nature as regards the sensuous intuition by which

    nature is given to us becomes possible and is thus determined

  
above all the reader must pay attention to the mode of proof of

  the principles which occur under the title of analogies of experience for these do not

  refer to the genesis of intuitions as do the principles of applied mathematics but to

  the connexion of their existence in experience and this can be nothing but the

  determination of their existence in time according to necessary laws under which alone

  the connexion is objectively valid and thus becomes experience the proof therefore

  does not turn on the synthetical unity in the connexion of things in themselves but

  merely of perceptions and of these not in regard to their matter but to the

  determination of time and of the relation of their existence in it according to

  universal laws if the empirical determination in relative time is indeed objectively

  valid ie experience these universal laws contain the necessary determination of

  existence in time generally viz according to a rule of the understanding

  a priori
in these prolegomena i cannot further descant on the subject but

  my reader who has probably been long accustomed to consider experience a mere

  empirical synthesis of perceptions and hence not considered that it goes much beyond

  them as it imparts to empirical judgments universal validity and for that purpose

  requires a pure and a priori unity of the understanding is

  recommended to pay special attention to this distinction of experience from a mere

  aggregate of perceptions and to judge the mode of proof from this point of view
 27  now we are prepared to remove humes doubt he justly

  maintains that we cannot comprehend by reason the possibility of causality that is

  of the reference of the existence of one thing to the existence of another which is

  necessitated by the former i add that we comprehend just as little the concept of

  subsistence that is the necessity that at the foundation of the existence of things

  there lies a subject which cannot itself be a predicate of any other thing nay we

  cannot even form a notion of the possibility of such a thing though we can point out

  examples of its use in experience the very same in comprehensibility affects the

  community of things as we cannot comprehend how from the state of one thing an

  inference to the state of quite another thing beyond it and vice

  versa can be drawn and how substances which have each their own separate

  existence should depend upon one another necessarily but i am very far from holding

  these concepts to be derived merely from experience and the necessity represented in

  them to be imaginary and a mere illusion produced in us by long habit on the

  contrary i have amply shown that they and the theorems derived from them are firmly

  established a priori or before all experience and have their

  undoubted objective value though only with regard to experience
 28 though i have no notion of such a connexion of things in

  themselves that they can either exist as substances or act as causes or stand in

  community with others as parts of a real whole and i can just as little conceive

  such properties in appearances as such because those concepts contain nothing that

  lies in the appearances but only what the understanding alone must think we have yet

  a notion of such a connexion of representations in our understanding and in judgments

  generally consisting in this that representations appear in one sort of judgments as

  subject in relation to predicates in another as reason in relation to consequences

  and in a third as parts which constitute together a total possible cognition besides

  we cognise a priori that without considering the representation

  of an object as determined in some of these respects we can have no valid cognition of

  the object and if we should occupy ourselves about the object in itself there is no

  possible attribute by which i could know that it is determined under any of these

  aspects that is under the concept either of substance or of cause or in relation

  to other substances of community for i have no notion of the possibility of such a

  connexion of existence but the question is not how things in themselves but how the

  empirical cognition of things is determined as regards the above aspects of judgments

  in general that is how things as objects of experience can and shall be subsumed

  under these concepts of the understanding and then it is clear that i completely

  comprehend not only the possibility but also the necessity of subsuming all phenomena

  under these concepts that is of using them for principles of the possibility of

  experience
 29  when making an experiment with humes problematical

  concept his crux metaphysicorum the concept of cause we

  have in the first place given a priori by means of logic

  the form of a conditional judgment in general ie we have one given cognition as

  antecedent and another as consequence but it is possible that in perception we may

  meet with a rule of relation which runs thus that a certain phenomenon is constantly

  followed by another though not conversely and this is a case for me to use the

  hypothetical judgment and for instance to say it the sun shines long enough upon a

  body it grows warm here there is indeed as yet no necessity of connexion or concept

  of cause but i proceed and say that if this proposition which is merely a subjective

  connexion of perceptions is to be a judgment of experience it must be considered as

  necessary and universally valid such a proposition would be the sun is by its light

  the cause of heat the empirical rule is now considered as a law and as valid not

  merely of appearances but valid of them for the purposes of a possible experience which

  requires universal and therefore necessarily valid rules i therefore easily comprehend

  the concept of cause as a concept necessarily belonging to the mere form of

  experience and its possibility as a synthetical union of perceptions in consciousness

  generally but i do not at all comprehend the possibility of a thing generally as a

  cause because the concept of cause denotes a condition not at all belonging to things

  but to experience it is nothing in fact but an objectively valid cognition of

  appearances and of their succession so far as the antecedent can be conjoined with the

  consequent according to the rule of hypothetical judgments
 30  hence if the pure concepts of the understanding do not

  refer to objects of experience but to things in themselves noumena they have no signification whatever they serve as it were only

  to decipher appearances that we may be able to read them as experience the principles

  which arise from their reference to the sensible world only serve our understanding

  for empirical use beyond this they are arbitrary combinations without objective

  reality and we can neither cognise their possibility a priori

  nor verify their reference to objects let alone make it intelligible by any example

  because examples can only be borrowed from some possible experience consequently the

  objects of these concepts can be found nowhere but in a possible experience
this complete though to its originator unexpected solution of

  humes problem rescues for the pure concepts of the understanding their a priori origin and for the universal laws of nature their validity as

  laws of the understanding yet in such a way as to limit their use to experience

  because their possibility depends solely on the reference of the understanding to

  experience but with a completely reversed mode of connexion which never occurred to

  hume not by deriving them from experience but by deriving experience from them
this is therefore the result of all our foregoing inquiries all

  synthetical principles a priori are nothing more than

  principles of possible experience and can never be referred to things in themselves

  but to appearances as objects of experience and hence pure mathematics as well as a

  pure science of nature can never be referred to anything more than mere appearances

  and can only represent either that which makes experience generally possible or else

  that which as it is derived from these principles must always be capable of being

  represented in some possible experience
 31  and thus we have at last something definite upon which

  to depend in all metaphysical enterprises which have hitherto boldly enough but

  always at random attempted everything without discrimination that the aim of their

  exertions should be so near struck neither the dogmatical thinkers nor those who

  confident in their supposed sound common sense started with concepts and principles of

  pure reason which were legitimate and natural but destined for mere empirical use in

  quest of fields of knowledge to which they neither knew nor could know any determinate

  bounds because they had never reflected nor were able to reflect on the nature or even

  on the possibility of such a pure understanding
many a naturalist of pure reason by which i mean the man who

  believes he can decide in matters of metaphysics without any science may pretend that

  he long ago by the prophetic spirit of his sound sense not only suspected but knew

  and comprehended what is here propounded with so much ado or if he likes with

  prolix and pedantic pomp that with all our reason we can never reach beyond the field

  of experience but when he is questioned about his rational principles individually

  he must grant that there are many of them which he has not taken from experience and

  which are therefore independent of it and valid a priori how

  then and on what grounds will he restrain both himself and the dogmatist who makes use

  of these concepts and principles beyond all possible experience because they are

  recognised to be independent of it and even he this adept in sound sense in spite of

  all his assumed and cheaply acquired wisdom is not exempt from wandering inadvertently

  beyond objects of experience into the field of chimeras he is often deeply enough

  involved in them though in announcing everything as mere probability rational

  conjecture or analogy he gives by his popular language a color to his groundless

  pretensions
 32  since the oldest days of philosophy inquirers into pure

  reason have conceived besides the things of sense or appearances phenomena which

  make up the sensible world certain creations of the understanding verstandeswesen called noumena which should constitute an intelligible

  world and as appearance and illusion were by those men identified a thing which we

  may well excuse in an undeveloped epoch actuality was only conceded to the creations

  of thought
and we indeed rightly considering objects of sense as mere

  appearances confess thereby that they are based upon a thing in itself though we know

  not this thing in its internal constitution but only know its appearances viz the

  way in which our senses are affected by this unknown something the understanding

  therefore by assuming appearances grants the existence of things in themselves also

  and so far we may say that the representation of such things as form the basis of

  phenomena consequently of mere creations of the understanding is not only admissible

  but unavoidable
our critical deduction by no means excludes things of that sort

  noumena but rather limits the principles of the aesthetic the science of the

  sensibility to this that they shall not extend to all things as everything would

  then be turned into mere appearance but that they shall only hold good of objects of

  possible experience hereby then objects of the understanding are granted but with the

  inculcation of this rule which admits of no exception that we neither know nor can

  know anything at all definite of these pure objects of the understanding because our

  pure concepts of the understanding as well as our pure intuitions extend to nothing but

  objects of possible experience consequently to mere things of sense and as soon as we

  leave this sphere these concepts retain no meaning whatever
 33  there is indeed something seductive in our pure

  concepts of the understanding which tempts us to a transcendent use a use which

  transcends all possible experience not only are our concepts of substance of power

  of action of reality and others quite independent of experience containing nothing

  of sense appearance and so apparently applicable to things in themselves noumena

  but what strengthens this conjecture they contain a necessity of determination in

  themselves which experience never attains the concept of cause implies a rule

  according to which one state follows another necessarily but experience can only show

  us that one state of things often or at most commonly follows another and

  therefore affords neither strict universality nor necessity
hence the categories seem to have a deeper meaning and import than

  can be exhausted by their empirical use and so the understanding inadvertently adds

  for itself to the house of experience a much more extensive wing which it fills with

  nothing but creatures of thought without ever observing that it has transgressed with

  its otherwise lawful concepts the bounds of their use


     34  two important and even indispensable though very dry investigations

    had therefore become indispensable in the critique of pure reasonviz the two

    chapters vom schematismus der reinen verstandsbegriffe and vom grunde der

    unterscheidung aller verstandesbegriffe berhaupt in

    phnomena und noumena in the former it is shown that the

    senses furnish not the pure concepts of the understanding in

    concreto but only the schedule for their use and that the object conformable

    to it occurs only in experience as the product of the understanding from materials

    of the sensibility in the latter it is shown that although our pure concepts of

    the understanding and our principles are independent of experience and despite of

    the apparently greater sphere of their use still nothing whatever can be thought by

    them beyond the field of experience because they can do nothing but merely determine

    the logical form of the judgment relatively to given intuitions but as there is no

    intuition at all beyond the field of the sensibility these pure concepts as they

    cannot possibly be exhibited in concreto are void of all

    meaning consequently all these noumena together with their complex the

    intelligible world20 are nothing but representation of a

    problem of which the object in itself is possible but the solution from the nature

    of our understanding totally impossible for our understanding is not a faculty of

    intuition but of the connexion of given intuitions in experience experience must

    therefore contain all the objects for our concepts but beyond it no concepts have

    any significance as there is no intuition that might offer them a foundation

  
 35  the imagination may perhaps be forgiven for occasional

  vagaries and for not keeping carefully within the limits of experience since it gains

  life and vigor by such flights and since it is always easier to moderate its boldness

  than to stimulate its languor but the understanding which ought to think can never be

  forgiven for indulging in vagaries for we depend upon it alone for assistance to set

  bounds when necessary to the vagaries of the imagination
but the understanding begins its aberrations very innocently and

  modestly it first elucidates the elementary cognitions which inhere in it prior to

  all experience but yet must always have their application in experience it gradually

  drops these limits and what is there to prevent it as it has quite freely derived its

  principles from itself and then it proceeds first to newlyimagined powers in nature

  then to beings outside nature in short to a world for whose construction the

  materials cannot be wanting because fertile fiction furnishes them abundantly and

  though not confirmed is never refuted by experience this is the reason that young

  thinkers are so partial to metaphysics of the truly dogmatical kind and often

  sacrifice to it their time and their talents which might be otherwise better

  employed
but there is no use in trying to moderate these fruitless endeavors

  of pure reason by all manner of cautions as to the difficulties of solving questions so

  occult by complaints of the limits of our reason and by degrading our assertions into

  mere conjectures for if their impossibility is not distinctly shown and reasons

  cognition of its own essence does not become a true science in which the field of its

  right use is distinguished so to say with mathematical certainty from that of its

  worthless and idle use these fruitless efforts will never be abandoned for good
 36  how is nature itself possible
this questionthe highest point that transcendental philosophy can

  ever reach and to which as its boundary and completion it must proceedproperly

  contains two questions
first how is nature at all possible in

  the material sense by intuition considered as the totality of appearances how are

  space time and that which fills boththe object of sensation in general possible

  the answer is by means of the constitution of our sensibility according to which it

  is specifically affected by objects which are in themselves unknown to it and totally

  distinct from those phenomena this answer is given in the critique itself in the transcendental aesthetic and in these prolegomena by the solution of the first general problem
secondly how is nature possible in the

  formal sense as the totality of the rules under which all phenomena must come in

  order to be thought as connected in experience the answer must be this it is only

  possible by means of the constitution of our understanding according to which all the

  above representations of the sensibility are necessarily referred to a consciousness

  and by which the peculiar way in which we think viz by rules and hence experience

  also are possible but must be clearly distinguished from an insight into the objects

  in themselves this answer is given in the critique itself in

  the transcendental logic and in these prolegomena in the

  course of the solution of the second main problem
but how this peculiar property of our sensibility itself is

  possible or that of our understanding and of the apperception which is necessarily its

  basis and that of all thinking cannot be further analysed or answered because it is

  of them that we are in need for all our answers and for all our thinking about

  objects
there are many laws of nature which we can only know by means of

  experience but conformity to law in the connexion of appearances ie in nature in

  general we cannot discover by any experience because experience itself requires laws

  which are a priori at the basis of its possibility
the possibility of experience in general is therefore at the same

  time the universal law of nature and the principles of the experience are the very

  laws of nature for we do not know nature but as the totality of appearances ie of

  representations in us and hence we can only derive the laws of its connexion from the

  principles of their connexion in us that is from the conditions of their necessary

  union in consciousness which constitutes the possibility of experience
even the main proposition expounded throughout this sectionthat

  universal laws of nature can be distinctly cognised a

  priorileads naturally to the proposition that the highest legislation of

  nature must lie in ourselves ie in our understanding and that we must not seek the

  universal laws of nature in nature by means of experience but conversely must seek

  nature as to its universal conformity to law in the conditions of the possibility of

  experience which lie in our sensibility and in our understanding for how were it

  otherwise possible to know a priori these laws as they are not

  rules of analytical cognition but truly synthetical extensions of it


    such a necessary agreement of the principles of possible experience with the laws of

    the possibility of nature can only proceed from one of two reasons either these

    laws are drawn from nature by means of experience or conversely nature is derived

    from the laws of the possibility of experience in general and is quite the same as

    the mere universal conformity to law of the latter the former is selfcontradictory

    for the universal laws of nature can and must be cognised a

    priori that is independent of all experience and be the foundation of all

    empirical use of the understanding the latter alternative therefore alone

    remains21
but we must distinguish the empirical laws of nature which always

  presuppose particular perceptions from the pure or universal laws of nature which

  without being based on particular perceptions contain merely the conditions of their

  necessary union in experience in relation to the latter nature and possible

  experience are quite the same and as the conformity to law here depends upon the

  necessary connexion of appearances in experience without which we cannot cognise any

  object whatever in the sensible world consequently upon the original laws of the

  understanding it seems at first strange but is not the less certain to say
the understanding does not derive its laws a priori from but

  prescribes them to nature
 37  we shall illustrate this seemingly bold proposition by

  an example which will show that laws which we discover in objects of sensuous

  intuition especially when these laws are cognised as necessary are commonly held by

  us to be such as have been placed there by the understanding in spite of their being

  similar in all points to the laws of nature which we ascribe to experience
 38  if we consider the properties of the circle by which

  this figure combines so many arbitrary determinations of space in itself at once in a

  universal rule we cannot avoid attributing a constitution eine

  natur to this geometrical thing two right lines for example which intersect

  one another and the circle howsoever they may be drawn are always divided so that the

  rectangle constructed with the segments of the one is equal to that constructed with

  the segments of the other the question now is does this law lie in the circle or in

  the understanding that is does this figure independently of the understanding

  contain in itself the ground of the law or does the understanding having constructed

  according to its concepts according to the quality of the radii the figure itself

  introduce into it this law of the chords cutting one another in geometrical proportion

  when we follow the proofs of this law we soon perceive that it can only be derived

  from the condition on which the understanding founds the construction of this figure

  and which is that of the equality of the radii but if we enlarge this concept to

  pursue further the unity of various properties of geometrical figures under common

  laws and consider the circle as a conic section which of course is subject to the

  same fundamental conditions of construction as other conic sections we shall find that

  all the chords which intersect within the ellipse parabola and hyperbola always

  intersect so that the rectangles of their segments are not indeed equal but always

  bear a constant ratio to one another if we proceed still farther to the fundamental

  laws of physical astronomy we find a physical law of reciprocal attraction diffused

  over all material nature the rule of which is that it decreases inversely as the

  square of the distance from each attracting point ie as the spherical surfaces

  increase over which this force spreads which law seems to be necessarily inherent in

  the very nature of things and hence is usually propounded as cognisable a priori simple as the sources of this law are merely resting upon the

  relation of spherical surfaces of different radii its consequences are so valuable

  with regard to the variety of their agreement and its regularity that not only are all

  possible orbits of the celestial bodies conic sections but such a relation of these

  orbits to each other results that no other law of attraction than that of the inverse

  square of the distance can be imagined as fit for a cosmical system
here accordingly is a nature that rests upon laws which the

  understanding cognises a priori and chiefly from the universal

  principles of the determination of space now i ask
do the laws of nature lie in space and does the understanding

  learn them by merely endeavoring to find out the enormous wealth of meaning that lies

  in space or do they inhere in the understanding and in the way in which it determines

  space according to the conditions of the synthetical unity in which its concepts are

  all centred
space is something so uniform and as to all particular properties

  so indeterminate that we should certainly not seek a store of laws of nature in it

  whereas that which determines space to assume the form of a circle or the figures of a

  cone and a sphere is the understanding so far as it contains the ground of the unity

  of their constructions


    the mere universal form of intuition called space must therefore be the substratum

    of all intuitions determinable to particular objects and in it of course the

    condition of the possibility and of the variety of these intuitions lies but the

    unity of the objects is entirely determined by the understanding and on conditions

    which lie in its own nature and thus the understanding is the origin of the

    universal order of nature in that it comprehends all appearances under its own laws

    and thereby first constructs a priori experience as to its

    form by means of which whatever is to be cognised only by experience is

    necessarily subjected to its laws for we are not now concerned with the nature of

    things in themselves which is independent of the conditions both of our sensibility

    and our understanding but with nature as an object of possible experience and in

    this case the understanding whilst it makes experience possible thereby insists

    that the sensuous world is either not an object of experience at all or must be

    nature viz an existence of things determined according to universal

    laws22


appendix to the pure science of nature
 39  of the system of the

  categories
there can be nothing more desirable to a philosopher than to be

  able to derive the scattered multiplicity of the concepts or the principles which had

  occurred to him in concrete use from a principle a priori and

  to unite everything in this way in one cognition he formerly only believed that those

  things which remained after a certain abstraction and seemed by comparison among one

  another to constitute a particular kind of cognitions were completely collected but

  this was only an aggregate now he knows that just so many neither more nor less can

  constitute the mode of cognition and perceives the necessity of his division which

  constitutes comprehension and now only he has attained a system
to search in our daily cognition for the concepts which do not

  rest upon particular experience and yet occur in all cognition of experience where

  they as it were constitute the mere form of connexion presupposes neither greater

  reflexion nor deeper insight than to detect in a language the rules of the actual use

  of words generally and thus to collect elements for a grammar in fact both researches

  are very nearly related even though we are not able to give a reason why each language

  has just this and no other formal constitution and still less why an exact number of

  such formal determinations in general are found in it


    aristotle collected ten pure elementary concepts under the name of

    categories23 to these which are also called

    predicaments he found himself obliged afterwards to add five

    postpredicaments24 some of which however prius

    simul and motus are contained in

    the former but this random collection must be considered and commended as a mere

    hint for future inquirers not as a regularly developed idea and hence it has in

    the present more advanced state of philosophy been rejected as quite useless

  
after long reflexion on the pure elements of human knowledge those

  which contain nothing empirical i at last succeeded in distinguishing with certainty

  and in separating the pure elementary notions of the sensibility space and time from

  those of the understanding thus the 7th 8th and 9th categories had to be excluded

  from the old list and the others were of no service to me because there was no

  principle in them on which the understanding could be investigated measured in its

  completion and all the functions whence its pure concepts arise determined

  exhaustively and with precision
but in order to discover such a principle i looked about for an

  act of the understanding which comprises all the rest and is distinguished only by

  various modifications or phases in reducing the multiplicity of representation to the

  unity of thinking in general i found this act of the understanding to consist in

  judging here then the labors of the logicians were ready at hand though not yet quite

  free from defects and with this help i was enabled to exhibit a complete table of the

  pure functions of the understanding which are however undetermined in regard to any

  object i finally referred these functions of judging to objects in general or rather

  to the condition of determining judgments as objectively valid and so there arose the

  pure concepts of the understanding concerning which i could make certain that these

  and this exact number only constitute our whole cognition of things from pure

  understanding i was justified in calling them by their old name categories while i reserved for myself the liberty of adding under the

  title of predicables a complete list of all the concepts deducible from them by

  combinations whether among themselves or with the pure form of the appearance ie

  space or time or with its matter so far as it is not yet empirically determined

  viz the object of sensation in general as soon as a system of transcendental

  philosophy should be completed with the construction of which i am engaged in the

  critique of pure reason itself
now the essential point in this system of categories which

  distinguishes it from the old rhapsodical collection without any principle and for

  which alone it deserves to be considered as philosophy consists in this that by means

  of it the true significance of the pure concepts of the understanding and the condition

  of their use could be precisely determined for here it became obvious that they are

  themselves nothing but logical functions and as such do not produce the least concept

  of an object but require some sensuous intuition as a basis they therefore only serve

  to determine empirical judgments which are otherwise undetermined and indifferent as

  regards all functions of judging relatively to these functions thereby procuring them

  universal validity and by means of them making judgments of experience in general

  possible
such an insight into the nature of the categories which limits

  them at the same time to the mere use of experience never occurred either to their

  first author or to any of his successors but without this insight which immediately

  depends upon their derivation or deduction they are quite useless and only a

  miserable list of names without explanation or rule for their use had the ancients

  ever conceived such a notion doubtless the whole study of the pure rational knowledge

  which under the name of metaphysics has for centuries spoiled many a sound mind would

  have reached us in quite another shape and would have enlightened the human

  understanding instead of actually exhausting it in obscure and vain speculations

  thereby rendering it unfit for true science


    this system of categories makes all treatment of every object of pure reason itself

    systematic and affords a direction or clue how and through what points of inquiry

    every metaphysical consideration must proceed in order to be complete for it

    exhausts all the possible movements momenta of the

    understanding among which every concept must be classed in like manner the table of

    principles has been formulated the completeness of which we can only vouch for by

    the system of the categories even in the division of the concepts25 which must go beyond the physical

    application of the understanding it is always the very same clue which as it must

    always be determined a priori by the same fixed points of the

    human understanding always forms a closed circle there is no doubt that the object

    of a pure conception either of the understanding or of reason so far as it is to be

    estimated philosophically and on a priori principles can in

    this way be completely cognised i could not therefore omit to make use of this clue

    with regard to one of the most abstract ontological divisions viz the various

    distinctions of the notions of something and of nothing and to construct

    accordingly critique p 207 a regular and necessary

    table of their divisions26



    and this system like every other true one founded on a universal principle shows

    its inestimable value in this that it excludes all foreign concepts which might

    otherwise intrude among the pure concepts of the understanding and determines the

    place of every cognition those concepts which under the name of concepts of

    reflexion have been likewise arranged in a table according to the clue of the

    categories intrude without having any privilege or title to be among the pure

    concepts of the understanding in ontology they are concepts of connexion and

    thereby of the objects themselves whereas the former are only concepts of a mere

    comparison of concepts already given hence of quite another nature and use by my

    systematic division27

	they are saved from this confusion

    but the value of my special table of the categories will be still more obvious when

    we separate the table of the transcendental concepts of reason from the concepts of

    the understanding the latter being of quite another nature and origin they must

    have quite another form than the former this so necessary separation has never yet

    been made in any system of metaphysics for as a rule these rational concepts all

    mixed up with the categories like children of one family which confusion was

    unavoidable in the absence of a definite system of categories

  
third

  part of the main transcendental problem
how is metaphysics in general possible
 40
pure mathematics and pure science of nature had no occasion for

  such a deduction as we have made of both for their own safety and certainty for the

  former rests upon its own evidence and the latter though sprung from pure sources of

  the understanding upon experience and its thorough confirmation physics cannot

  altogether refuse and dispense with the testimony of the latter because with all its

  certainty it can never as philosophy rival mathematics both sciences therefore

  stood in need of this inquiry not for themselves but for the sake of another science

  metaphysics


    metaphysics has to do not only with concepts of nature which always find their

    application in experience but also with pure rational concepts which never can be

    given in any possible experience consequently the objective reality of these

    concepts viz that they are not mere chimeras and the truth or falsity of

    metaphysical assertions cannot be discovered or confirmed by any experience this

    part of metaphysics however is precisely what constitutes its essential end to which

    the rest is only a means and thus this science is in need of such a deduction for

    its own sake the third question now proposed relates therefore as it were to the

    root and essential difference of metaphysics ie the occupation of reason with

    itself and the supposed knowledge of objects arising immediately from this

    incubation of its own concepts without requiring or indeed being able to reach that

    knowledge through experience28

without solving this problem reason never is justified the

  empirical use to which reason limits the pure understanding does not fully satisfy the

  proper destination of the latter every single experience is only a part of the whole

  sphere of its domain but the absolute totality of all possible experience is itself

  not experience yet it is a necessary concrete problem for reason the mere

  representation of which requires concepts quite different from the categories whose

  use is only immanent or refers to experience so far as it can be given whereas the

  concepts of reason aim at the completeness ie the collective unity of all possible

  experience and thereby transcend every given experience thus they become transcendent
as the understanding stands in need of categories for experience reason

  contains in itself the source of ideas by which i mean necessary concepts whose

  object cannot be given in any experience the latter are inherent in the nature of

  reason as the former are in that of the understanding while the former carry with

  them an illusion likely to mislead the illusion of the latter is inevitable though it

  certainly can be kept from misleading us
since all illusion consists in holding the subjective ground of our

  judgments to be objective a selfknowledge of pure reason in its transcendent

  exaggerated use is the sole preservative from the aberrations into which reason falls

  when it mistakes its destination and refers that to the object transcendently which

  only regards its own subject and its guidance in all immanent use
 41  the distinction of ideas that is of pure concepts of

  reason from categories or pure concepts of the understanding as cognitions of a

  quite distinct species origin and use is so important a point in founding a science

  which is to contain the system of all these a priori

  cognitions that without this distinction metaphysics is absolutely impossible or is

  at best a random bungling attempt to build a castle in the air without a knowledge of

  the materials or of their fitness for any purpose had the critique of

  pure reason done nothing but first point out this distinction it had thereby

  contributed more to clear up our conception of and to guide our inquiry in the field

  of metaphysics than all the vain efforts which have hitherto been made to satisfy the

  transcendent problems of pure reason without ever surmising that we were in quite

  another field than that of the understanding and hence classing concepts of the

  understanding and those of reason together as if they were of the same kind
 42  all pure cognitions of the understanding have this

  feature that their concepts present themselves in experience and their principles can

  be confirmed by it whereas the transcendent cognitions of reason cannot either as

  ideas appear in experience or as propositions ever be confirmed or refuted by it

  hence whatever errors may slip in unawares can only be discovered by pure reason

  itselfa discovery of much difficulty because this very reason naturally becomes

  dialectical by means of its ideas and this unavoidable illusion cannot be limited by

  any objective and dogmatical researches into things but by a subjective investigation

  of reason itself as a source of ideas
 43  in the critique of pure reason

  it was always my greatest care to endeavor not only carefully to distinguish the

  several species of cognition but to derive concepts belonging to each one of them from

  their common source i did this in order that by knowing whence they originated i

  might determine their use with safety and also have the unanticipated but invaluable

  advantage of knowing the completeness of my enumeration classification and

  specification of concepts a priori and therefore according to

  principles without this metaphysics is mere rhapsody in which no one knows whether

  he has enough or whether and where something is still wanting we can indeed have this

  advantage only in pure philosophy but of this philosophy it constitutes the very

  essence
as i had found the origin of the categories in the four logical

  functions of all the judgments of the understanding it was quite natural to seek the

  origin of the ideas in the three functions of the syllogisms of reason for as soon as

  these pure concepts of reason the transcendental ideas are given they could hardly

  except they be held innate be found anywhere else than in the same activity of

  reason which so far as it regards mere form constitutes the logical element of the

  syllogisms of reason but so far as it represents judgments of the understanding with

  respect to the one or to the other form a priori constitutes

  transcendental concepts of pure reason


    the formal distinction of syllogisms renders their division into categorical

    hypothetical and disjunctive necessary the concepts of reason founded on them

    contained therefore first the idea of the complete subject the substantial

    secondly the idea of the complete series of conditions thirdly the determination

    of all concepts in the idea of a complete complex of that which is

    possible29

	the first idea is psychological the

    second cosmological the third theological and as all three give occasion to

    dialectics yet each in its own way the division of the whole dialects of pure

    reason into its paralogism its antinomy and its ideal was arranged accordingly

    through this deduction we may feel assured that all the claims of pure reason are

    completely represented and that none can be wanting because the faculty of reason

    itself whence they all take their origin is thereby completely surveyed

  
 44  in these general considerations it is also remarkable

  that the ideas of reason are unlike the categories of no service to the use of our

  understanding in experience but quite dispensable and become even an impediment to

  the maxims of a rational cognition of nature yet in another aspect still to be

  determined they are necessary whether the soul is or is not a simple substance is of

  no consequence to us in the explanation of its phenomena for we cannot render the

  notion of a simple being intelligible by any possible experience that is sensuous or

  concrete the notion is therefore quite void as regards all hopedfor insight into the

  cause of phenomena and cannot at all serve as a principle of the explanation of that

  which internal or external experience supplies so the cosmological ideas of the

  beginning of the world or of its eternity a parte ante cannot

  be of any greater service to us for the explanation of any event in the world itself

  and finally we must according to a right maxim of the philosophy of nature refrain

  from all explanations of the design of nature drawn from the will of a supreme being

  because this would not be natural philosophy but an acknowledgment that we have come

  to the end of it the use of these ideas therefore is quite different from that of

  those categories by which and by the principles built upon which experience itself

  first becomes possible but our laborious analytics of the understanding would be

  superfluous if we had nothing else in view than the mere cognition of nature as it can

  be given in experience for reason does its work both in mathematics and in the

  science of nature quite safely and well without any of this subtle deduction

  therefore our critique of the understanding combines with the ideas of pure reason for

  a purpose which lies beyond the empirical use of the understanding but this we have

  above declared to be in this aspect totally inadmissible and without any object or

  meaning yet there must be a harmony between that of the nature of reason and that of

  the understanding and the former must contribute to the perfection of the latter and

  cannot possibly upset it
the solution of this question is as follows pure reason does not

  in its ideas point to particular objects which lie beyond the field of experience but

  only requires completeness of the use of the understanding in the system of experience

  but this completeness can be a completeness of principles only not of intuitions

  ie concrete atsights or anschauungen and of objects in

  order however to represent the ideas definitely reason conceives them after the

  fashion of the cognition of an object the cognition is as far as these rules are

  concerned completely determined but the object is only an idea invented for the

  purpose of bringing the cognition of the understanding as near as possible to the

  completeness represented by that idea
prefatory remark to the dialectics of pure

  reason
 45  we have above shown in  33 and 34 that the purity of

  the categories from all admixture of sensuous determinations may mislead reason into

  extending their use quite beyond all experience to things in themselves though as

  these categories themselves find no intuition which can give them meaning or sense

  in concreto they as mere logical functions can represent a

  thing in general but not give by themselves alone a determinate concept of anything

  such hyperbolical objects are distinguised by the appellation of nomena or pure beings of

  the understanding or better beings of thought such as for example substance

  but conceived without permanence in time or cause but not acting in time etc here

  predicates that only serve to make the conformitytolaw of experience possible are

  applied to these concepts and yet they are deprived of all the conditions of

  intuition on which alone experience is possible and so these concepts lose all

  significance
there is no danger however of the understanding spontaneously

  making an excursion so very wantonly beyond its own bounds into the field of the mere

  creatures of thought without being impelled by foreign laws but when reason which

  cannot be fully satisfied with any empirical use of the rules of the understanding as

  being always conditioned requires a completion of this chain of conditions then the

  understanding is forced out of its sphere and then it partly represents objects of

  experience in a series so extended that no experience can grasp partly even with a

  view to complete the series it seeks entirely beyond it noumena to which it can

  attach that chain and so having at last escaped from the conditions of experience

  make its attitude as it were final these are then the transcendental ideas which

  though according to the true but hidden ends of the natural determination of our

  reason they may aim not at extravagant concepts but at an unbounded extension of

  their empirical use yet seduce the understanding by an unavoidable illusion to a

  transcendent use which though deceitful cannot be restrained within the bounds of

  experience by any resolution but only by scientific instruction and with much

  difficulty


    i  the psychological idea30

 46  people have long since observed that in all substances

  the proper subject that which remains after all the accidents as predicates are

  abstracted consequently that which forms the substance of things remains unknown and

  various complaints have been made concerning these limits to our knowledge but it will

  be well to consider that the human understanding is not to be blamed for its inability

  to know the substance of things that is to determine it by itself but rather for

  requiring to cognise it which is a mere idea definitely as though it were a given

  object pure reason requires us to seek for every predicate of a thing its proper

  subject and for this subject which is itself necessarily nothing but a predicate its

  subject and so on indefinitely or as far as we can reach but hence it follows that

  we must not hold anything at which we can arrive to be an ultimate subject and that

  substance itself never can be thought by our understanding however deep we may

  penetrate even if all nature were unveiled to us for the specific nature of our

  understanding consists in thinking everything discursively that is representing it by

  concepts and so by mere predicates to which therefore the absolute subject must

  always be wanting hence all the real properties by which we cognise bodies are mere

  accidents not excepting impenetrability which we can only represent to ourselves as

  the effect of a power of which the subject is unknown to us


    now we appear to have this substance in the consciousness of ourselves in the

    thinking subject and indeed in an immediate intuition for all the predicates of an

    internal sense refer to the ego as a subject and i cannot conceive myself as the

    predicate of any other subject hence completeness in the reference of the given

    concepts as predicates to a subjectnot merely an idea but an objectthat is the

    absolute subject itself seems to be given in experience but this expectation is

    disappointed for the ego is not a concept31

	but only the indication of the object

    of the internal sense so far as we cognise it by no further predicate consequently

    it cannot be in itself a predicate of any other thing but just as little can it be a

    determinate concept of an absolute subject but is as in all other cases only the

    reference of the internal phenomena to their unknown subject yet this idea which

    serves very well as a regulative principle totally to destroy all materialistic

    explanations of the internal phenomena of the soul occasions by a very natural

    misunderstanding a very specious argument which from this supposed cognition of the

    substance of our thinking being infers its nature so far as the knowledge of it

    falls quite without the complex of experience

  
 47  but though we may call this thinking self the soul

  substance as being the ultimate subject of thinking which cannot be further

  represented as the predicate of another thing it remains quite empty and without

  significance if permanencethe quality which renders the concept of substances in

  experience fruitfulcannot be proved of it


    but permanence can never be proved of the concept of a substance as a thing in

    itself but for the purposes of experience only this is sufficiently shown by the

    first analogy of experience32 and who ever will not yield to this

    proof may try for himself whether he can succeed in proving from the concept of a

    subject which does not exist itself as the predicate of another thing that its

    existence is thoroughly permanent and that it cannot either in itself or by any

    natural cause originate or be annihilated these synthetical a

    priori propositions can never be proved in themselves but only in reference

    to things as objects of possible experience

  


     48  if therefore from the concept of the soul as a substance we would infer

    its permanence this can hold good as regards possible experience only not of the

    soul as a thing in itself and beyond all possible experience but life is the

    subjective condition of all our possible experience consequently we can only infer

    the permanence of the soul in life for the death of man is the end of all experience

    which concerns the soul as an object of experience except the contrary be proved

    which is the very question in hand the permanence of the soul can therefore only be

    proved and no one cares for that during the life of man but not as we desire to

    do after death and for this general reason that the concept of substance so far

    as it is to be considered necessarily combined with the concept of permanence can be

    so combined only according to the principles of possible experience and therefore

    for the purposes of experience only33

 49  that there is something real without us which not

  only corresponds but must correspond to our external perceptions can likewise be

  proved to be not a connexion of things in themselves but for the sake of experience

  this means that there is something empirical ie some phenomenon in space without

  us that admits of a satisfactory proof for we have nothing to do with other objects

  than those which belong to possible experience because objects which cannot be given

  us in any experience do not exist for us empirically without me is that which appears

  in space and space together with all the phenomena which it contains belongs to the

  representations whose connexion according to laws of experience proves their objective

  truth just as the connexion of the phenomena of the internal sense proves the

  actuality of my soul as an object of the internal sense by means of external

  experience i am conscious of the actuality of bodies as external phenomena in space

  in the same manner as by means of the internal experience i am conscious of the

  existence of my soul in time but this soul is only cognised as an object of the

  internal sense by phenomena that constitute an internal state and of which the essence

  in itself which forms the basis of these phenomena is unknown cartesian idealism

  therefore does nothing but distinguish external experience from dreaming and the

  conformity to law as a criterion of its truth of the former from the irregularity

  and the false illusion of the latter in both it presupposes space and time as

  conditions of the existence of objects and it only inquires whether the objects of the

  external senses which we when awake put in space are as actually to be found in it

  as the object of the internal sense the soul is in time that is whether experience

  carries with it sure criteria to distinguish it from imagination this doubt however

  may be easily disposed of and we always do so in common life by investigating the

  connexion of phenomena in both space and time according to universal laws of

  experience and we cannot doubt when the representation of external things throughout

  agrees therewith that they constitute truthful experience material idealism in which

  phenomena are considered as such only according to their connexion in experience may

  accordingly be very easily refuted and it is just as sure an experience that bodies

  exist without us in space as that i myself exist according to the representation of

  the internal sense in time for the notion without us only signifies existence in

  space however as the ego in the proposition i am means not only the object of

  internal intuition in time but the subject of consciousness just as body means not

  only external intuition in space but the thinginitself which is the basis of this

  phenomenon as this is the case the question whether bodies as phenomena of the

  external sense exist as bodies apart from my thoughts may without any hesitation be

  denied in nature but the question whether i myself as a phenomenon of the internal

  sense the soul according to empirical psychology exist apart from my faculty of

  representation in time is an exactly similar inquiry and must likewise be answered in

  the negative and in this manner everything when it is reduced to its true meaning is

  decided and certain the formal which i have also called transcendental actually

  abolishes the material or cartesian idealism for if space be nothing but a form of

  my sensibility it is as a representation in me just as actual as i myself am and

  nothing but the empirical truth of the representations in it remains for consideration

  but if this is not the case if space and the phenomena in it are something existing

  without us then all the criteria of experience beyond our perception can never prove

  the actuality of these objects without us


    ii  the cosmological idea34

 50  this product of pure reason in its transcendent use is

  its most remarkable curiosity it serves as a very powerful agent to rouse philosophy

  from its dogmatic slumber and to stimulate it to the arduous task of undertaking a

  critique of reason itself
i term this idea cosmological because it always takes its object

  only from the sensible world and does not use any other than those whose object is

  given to sense consequently it remains in this respect in its native home it does not

  become transcendent and is therefore so far not mere idea whereas to conceive the

  soul as a simple substance already means to conceive such an object the simple as

  cannot be presented to the senses yet the cosmological idea extends the connexion of

  the conditioned with its condition whether the connexion is mathematical or dynamical

  so far that experience never can keep up with it it is therefore with regard to this

  point always an idea whose object never can be adequately given in any experience
 51  in the first place the use of a system of categories

  becomes here so obvious and unmistakable that even if there were not several other

  proofs of it this alone would sufficiently prove it indispensable in the system of

  pure reason there are only four such transcendent ideas as there are so many classes

  of categories in each of which however they refer only to the absolute completeness

  of the series of the conditions for a given conditioned in analogy to these

  cosmological ideas there are only four kinds of dialectical assertions of pure reason

  which as they are dialectical thereby prove that to each of them on equally

  specious principles of pure reason a contradictory assertion stands opposed as all

  the metaphysical art of the most subtile distinction cannot prevent this opposition it

  compels the philosopher to recur to the first sources of pure reason itself this

  antinomy not arbitrarily invented but founded in the nature of human reason and

  hence unavoidable and never ceasing contains the following four theses together with

  their antitheses
1
thesis
the world has as to time and space a beginning limit
antithesis
the world is as to time and space infinite
2
thesis
everything in the world consists of elements that are simple
antithesis
there is nothing simple but everything is composite
3
thesis
there are in the world causes through freedom
antithesis
there is no liberty but all is nature
4
thesis
in the series of the worldcauses there is some necessary being
antithesis
there is nothing necessary in the world but in this series all is

  incidental
 52a  here is the most singular

  phenomenon of human reason no other instance of which can be shown in any other use

  if we as is commonly done represent to ourselves the appearances of the sensible

  world as things in themselves if we assume the principles of their combination as

  principles universally valid of things in themselves and not merely of experience as

  is usually nay without our critique unavoidably done there

  arises an unexpected conflict which never can be removed in the common dogmatical way

  because the thesis as well as the antithesis can be shown by equally clear evident

  and irresistible proofsfor i pledge myself as to the correctness of all these

  proofsand reason therefore perceives that it is divided with itself a state at which

  the sceptic rejoices but which must make the critical philosopher pause and feel ill

  at ease
 52b  we may blunder in various

  ways in metaphysics without any fear of being detected in falsehood for we never can

  be refuted by experience if we but avoid selfcontradiction which in synthetical

  though purely fictitious propositions may be done whenever the concepts which we

  connect are mere ideas that cannot be given in their whole content in experience

  for how can we make out by experience whether the world is from eternity or had a

  beginning whether matter is infinitely divisible or consists of simple parts such

  concept cannot be given in any experience be it ever so extensive and consequently

  the falsehood either of the positive or the negative proposition cannot be discovered

  by this touchstone
the only possible way in which reason could have revealed

  unintentionally its secret dialectics falsely announced as dogmatics would be when it

  were made to ground an assertion upon a universally admitted principle and to deduce

  the exact contrary with the greatest accuracy of inference from another which is

  equally granted this is actually here the case with regard to four natural ideas of

  reason whence four assertions on the one side and as many counterassertions on the

  other arise each consistently following from universallyacknowledged principles thus

  they reveal by the use of these principles the dialectical illusion of pure reason

  which would otherwise forever remain concealed


    this is therefore a decisive experiment which must necessarily expose any error

    lying hidden in the assumptions of reason35 contradictory propositions cannot

    both be false except the concept which is the subject of both is

    selfcontradictory for example the propositions a square circle is round and a

    square circle is not round are both false for as to the former it is false that

    the circle is round because it is quadrangular and it is likewise false that it is

    not round that is angular because it is a circle for the logical criterion of the

    impossibility of a concept consists in this that if we presuppose it two

    contradictory propositions both become false consequently as no middle between them

    is conceivable nothing at all is thought by that concept

  
 52c the first two antinomies which i

  call mathematical because they are concerned with the addition or division of the

  homogeneous are founded on such a selfcontradictory concept and hence i explain how

  it happens that both the thesis and antithesis of the two are false
when i speak of objects in time and in space it is not of things

  in themselves of which i know nothing but of things in appearance that is of

  experience as the particular way of cognising objects which is afforded to man i must

  not say of what i think in time or in space that in itself and independent of these

  my thoughts it exists in space and in time for in that case i should contradict

  myself because space and time together with the appearances in them are nothing

  existing in themselves and outside of my representations but are themselves only modes

  of representation and it is palpably contradictory to say that a mere mode of

  representation exists without our representation objects of the senses therefore exist

  only in experience whereas to give them a selfsubsisting existence apart from

  experience or before it is merely to represent to ourselves that experience actually

  exists apart from experience or before it
now if i inquire after the quantity of the world as to space and

  time it is equally impossible as regards all my notions to declare it infinite or to

  declare it finite for neither assertion can be contained in experience because

  experience either of an infinite space or of an infinite time elapsed or again of

  the boundary of the world by a void space or by an antecedent void time is

  impossible these are mere ideas this quantity of the world which is determined in

  either way should therefore exist in the world itself apart from all experience this

  contradicts the notion of a world of sense which is merely a complex of the

  appearances whose existence and connexion occur only in our representations that is

  in experience since this latter is not an object in itself but a mere mode of

  representation hence it follows that as the concept of an absolutely existing world

  of sense is selfcontradictory the solution of the problem concerning its quantity

  whether attempted affirmatively or negatively is always false
the same holds good of the second antinomy which relates to the

  division of phenomena for these are mere representations and the parts exist merely

  in their representation consequently in the division or in a possible experience

  where they are given and the division reaches only as far as this latter reaches to

  assume that an appearance eg that of body contains in itself before all experience

  all the parts which any possible experience can ever reach is to impute to a mere

  appearance which can exist only in experience an existence previous to experience in

  other words it would mean that mere representations exist before they can be found in

  our faculty of representation such an assertion is selfcontradictory as also every

  solution of our misunderstood problem whether we maintain that bodies in themselves

  consist of an infinite number of parts or of a finite number of simple parts
 53  in the first the mathematical class of antinomies the

  falsehood of the assumption consists in representing in one concept something

  selfcontradictory as if it were compatible ie an appearance as an object in

  itself but as to the second the dynamical class of antinomies the falsehood of

  the representation consists in representing as contradictory what is compatible so

  that as in the former case the opposed assertions are both false in this case on

  the other hand where they are opposed to one another by mere misunderstanding they

  may both be true
any mathematical connexion necessarily presupposes homogeneity of

  what is connected in the concept of magnitude while the dynamical one by no means

  requires the same when we have to deal with extended magnitudes all the parts must be

  homogeneous with one another and with the whole whereas in the connexion of cause and

  effect homogeneity may indeed likewise be found but is not necessary for the concept

  of causality by means of which something is posited through something else quite

  different from it at all events does not require it
if the objects of the world of sense are taken for things in

  themselves and the above laws of nature for the laws of things in themselves the

  contradiction would be unavoidable so also if the subject of freedom were like other

  objects represented as mere appearance the contradiction would be just as

  unavoidable for the same predicate would at once be affirmed and denied of the same

  kind of object in the same sense but if natural necessity is referred merely to

  appearances and freedom merely to things in themselves no contradiction arises if we

  at once assume or admit both kinds of causality however difficult or impossible it

  may be to make the latter kind conceivable


    as appearance every effect is an event or something that happens in time it must

    according to the universal law of nature be preceded by a determination of the

    causality of its cause a state which follows according to a constant law but this

    determination of the cause as causality must likewise be something that takes place

    or happens the cause must have begun to act otherwise no succession between it and

    the effect could be conceived otherwise the effect as well as the causality of the

    cause would have always existed therefore the determination of the cause to act

    must also have originated among appearances and must consequently as well as its

    effect be an event which must again have its cause and so on hence natural

    necessity must be the condition on which effective causes are determined whereas if

    freedom is to be a property of certain causes of appearances it must as regards

    these which are events be a faculty of starting them spontaneously that is

    without the causality of the cause itself and hence without requiring any other

    ground to determine its start but then the cause as to its causality must not rank

    under timedeterminations of its state that is it cannot be an appearance and must

    be considered a thing in itself while its effects would be only

    appearances36 if without contradiction we can think

    of the beings of understanding verstandeswesen as

    exercising such an influence on appearances then natural necessity will attach to

    all connexions of cause and effect in the sensuous world though on the other hand

    freedom can be granted to such cause as is itself not an appearance but the

    foundation of appearance nature therefore and freedom can without contradiction be

    attributed to the very same thing but in different relationson one side as a

    phenomenon on the other as a thing in itself

  
we have in us a faculty which not only stands in connexion with

  its subjective determining grounds that are the natural causes of its actions and is

  so far the faculty of a being that itself belongs to appearances but is also referred

  to objective grounds that are only ideas so far as they can determine this faculty a

  connexion which is expressed by the word ought this faculty is

  called reason and so far as we consider a being man

  entirely according to this objectively determinable reason he cannot be considered as

  a being of sense but this property is that of a thing in itself of which we cannot

  comprehend the possibilityi mean how the ought which however

  has never yet taken place should determine its activity and can become the cause of

  actions whose effect is an appearance in the sensible world yet the causality of

  reason would be freedom with regard to the effects in the sensuous world so far as we

  can consider objective grounds which are themselves ideas as their determinants for

  its action in that case would not depend upon subjective conditions consequently not

  upon those of time and of course not upon the law of nature which serves to determine

  them because grounds of reason give to actions the rule universally according to

  principles without the influence of the circumstances of either time or place
what i adduce here is merely meant as an example to make the thing

  intelligible and does not necessarily belong to our problem which must be decided

  from mere concepts independently of the properties which we meet in the actual

  world
now i may say without contradiction that all the actions of

  rational beings so far as they are appearances occurring in any experience are

  subject to the necessity of nature but the same actions as regards merely the

  rational subject and its faculty of acting according to mere reason are free for what

  is required for the necessity of nature nothing more than the determinability of every

  event in the world of sense according to constant laws that is a reference to cause

  in the appearance in this process the thing in itself at its foundation and its

  causality remain unknown but i say that the law of nature remains whether the

  rational being is the cause of the effects in the sensuous world from reason that is

  through freedom or whether it does not determine them on grounds of reason for if

  the former is the case the action is performed according to maxims the effect of

  which as appearance is always conform able to constant laws if the latter is the case

  and the action not performed on principles of reason it is subjected to the empirical

  laws of the sensibility and in both cases the effects are connected according to

  constant laws more than this we do not require or know concerning natural necessity

  but in the former case reason is the cause of these laws of nature and therefore free

  in the latter the effects follow according to mere natural laws of sensibility because

  reason does not influence it but reason itself is not determined on that account by

  the sensibility and is therefore free in this case too freedom is therefore no

  hindrance to natural law in appearance neither does this law abrogate the freedom of

  the practical use of reason which is connected with things in themselves as

  determining grounds
thus practical freedom viz the freedom in which reason possesses

  causality according to objectively determining grounds is rescued and yet natural

  necessity is not in the least curtailed with regard to the very same effects as

  appearances the same remarks will serve to explain what we had to say concerning

  transcendental freedom and its compatibility with natural necessity in the same

  subject but not taken in the same reference for as to this every beginning of the

  action of a being from objective causes regarded as determining grounds is always a

  first start though the same action is in the series of appearances only a subordinate

  start which must be preceded by a state of the cause which determines it and is

  itself determined in the same manner by another immediately preceding thus we are

  able in rational beings or in beings generally so far as their causality is

  determined in them as things in themselves to imagine a faculty of beginning from

  itself a series of states without falling into contradiction with the laws of nature

  for the relation of the action to objective grounds of reason is not a timerelation

  in this case that which determines the causality does not precede in time the action

  because such determining grounds represent not a reference to objects of sense eg

  to causes in the appearances but to determining causes as things in themselves which

  do not rank under conditions of time and in this way the action with regard to the

  causality of reason can be considered as a first start in respect to the series of

  appearances and yet also as a merely subordinate beginning we may therefore without

  contradiction consider it in the former aspect as free but in the latter in so far as

  it is merely appearance as subject to natural necessity
as to the fourth antinomy it is solved in the same way as the

  conflict of reason with itself in the third for provided the cause in the appearance is distinguished from the cause of the appearance so far as it can be thought as a thing in itself both

  propositions are perfectly reconcilable the one that there is nowhere in the sensuous

  world a cause according to similar laws of causality whose existence is absolutely

  necessary the other that this world is nevertheless connected with a necessary being

  as its cause but of another kind and according to another law the incompatibility of

  these propositions entirely rests upon the mistake of extending what is valid merely of

  appearances to things in themselves and in general confusing both in one concept
 54  this then is the proposition and this the solution of

  the whole antinomy in which reason finds itself involved in the application of its

  principles to the sensible world the former alone the mere proposition would be a

  considerable service in the cause of our knowledge of human reason even though the

  solution might fail to fully satisfy the reader who has here to combat a natural

  illusion which has been but recently exposed to him and which he had hitherto always

  regarded as genuine for one result at least is unavoidable as it is quite impossible

  to prevent this conflict of reason with itselfso long as the objects of the sensible

  world are taken for things in themselves and not for mere appearances which they are

  in factthe reader is thereby compelled to examine over again the deduction of all our

  a priori cognition and the proof which i have given of my

  deduction in order to come to a decision on the question this is all i require at

  present for when in this occupation he shall have thought himself deep enough into the

  nature of pure reason those concepts by which alone the solution of the conflict of

  reason is possible will become sufficiently familiar to him without this preparation

  i cannot expect an unreserved assent even from the most attentive reader


    iii  the theological idea37

 55  the third transcendental idea which affords matter for

  the most important but if pursued only speculatively transcendent and thereby

  dialectical use of reason is the ideal of pure reason reason in this case does not

  as with the psychological and the cosmological ideas begin from experience and err by

  exaggerating its grounds in striving to attain if possible the absolute completeness

  of their series it rather totally breaks with experience and from mere concepts of

  what constitutes the absolute completeness of a thing in general consequently by means

  of the idea of a most perfect primal being it proceeds to determine the possibility

  and therefore the actuality of all other things and so the mere presupposition of a

  being who is conceived not in the series of experience yet for the purposes of

  experiencefor the sake of comprehending its connexion order and unityie the idea

  the notion of it is more easily distinguished from the concept of the understanding

  here than in the former cases hence we can easily expose the dialectical illusion

  which arises from our making the subjective conditions of our thinking objective

  conditions of objects themselves and an hypothesis necessary for the satisfaction of

  our reason a dogma as the observations of the critique on the pretensions of

  transcendental theology are intelligible clear and decisive i have nothing more to

  add on the subject
general remark on the

  transcendental ideas


     56  the objects which are given us by experience are in many respects

    incomprehensible and many questions to which the law of nature leads us when

    carried beyond a certain point though quite conformably to the laws of nature

    admit of no answer as for example the question why substances attract one another

    but if we entirely quit nature or in pursuing its combinations exceed all possible

    experience and so enter the realm of mere ideas we cannot then say that the object

    is incomprehensible and that the nature of things proposes to us insoluble problems

    for we are not then concerned with nature or in general with given objects but with

    concepts which have their origin merely in our reason and with mere creations of

    thought and all the problems that arise from our notions of them must be solved

    because of course reason can and must give a full account of its own

    procedure38 as the psychological cosmological

    and theological ideas are nothing but pure concepts of reason which cannot be given

    in any experience the questions which reason asks us about them are put to us not by

    the objects but by mere maxims of our reason for the sake of its own satisfaction

    they must all be capable of satisfactory answers which is done by showing that they

    are principles which bring our use of the understanding into thorough agreement

    completeness and synthetical unity and that they so far hold good of experience

    only but of experience as a whole

  
although an absolute whole of experience is impossible the idea of

  a whole of cognition according to principles must impart to our knowledge a peculiar

  kind of unity that of a system without which it is nothing but piecework and cannot

  be used for proving the existence of a highest purpose which can only be the general

  system of all purposes i do not here refer only to the practical but also to the

  highest purpose of the speculative use of reason
the transcendental ideas therefore express the peculiar application

  of reason as a principle of systematic unity in the use of the understanding yet if we

  assume this unity of the mode of cognition to be attached to the object of cognition

  if we regard that which is merely regulative to be constitutive and if we persuade

  ourselves that we can by means of these ideas enlarge our cognition transcendently or

  far beyond all possible experience while it only serves to render experience within

  itself as nearly complete as possible ie to limit its progress by nothing that

  cannot belong to experience we suffer from a mere misunderstanding in our estimate of

  the proper application of our reason and of its principles and from a dialectic which

  both confuses the empirical use of reason and also sets reason at variance with

  itself
conclusion
on the determination of the bounds of pure

  reason
 57  having adduced the clearest arguments it would be

  absurd for us to hope that we can know more of any object than belongs to the possible

  experience of it or lay claim to the least atom of knowledge about anything not

  assumed to be an object of possible experience which would determine it according to

  the constitution it has in itself for how could we determine anything in this way

  since time space and the categories and still more all the concepts formed by

  empirical experience or perception in the sensible world anschauung have and can have no other use than to make experience

  possible and if this condition is omitted from the pure concepts of the understanding

  they do not determine any object and have no meaning whatever
but it would be on the other hand a still greater absurdity if we

  conceded no things in themselves or set up our experience for the only possible mode

  of knowing things our way of beholding anschauung them in

  space and in time for the only possible way and our discursive understanding for the

  archetype of every possible understanding in fact if we wished to have the principles

  of the possibility of experience considered universal conditions of things in

  themselves
our principles which limit the use of reason to possible

  experience might in this way become transcendent and the limits of our reason be set

  up as limits of the possibility of things in themselves as humes dialogues may

  illustrate if a careful critique did not guard the bounds of our reason with respect

  to its empirical use and set a limit to its pretensions scepticism originally arose

  from metaphysics and its licentious dialectics at first it might merely to favor the

  empirical use of reason announce everything that transcends this use as worthless and

  deceitful but by and by when it was perceived that the very same principles that are

  used in experience insensibly and apparently with the same right led still further

  than experience extends then men began to doubt even the propositions of experience

  but here there is no danger for common sense will doubtless always assert its rights

  a certain confusion however arose in science which cannot determine how far reason is

  to be trusted and why only so far and no further and this confusion can only be

  cleared up and all future relapses obviated by a formal determination on principle of

  the boundary of the use of our reason
we cannot indeed beyond all possible experience form a definite

  notion of what things in themselves may be yet we are not at liberty to abstain

  entirely from inquiring into them for experience never satisfies reason fully but in

  answering questions refers us further and further back and leaves us dissatisfied

  with regard to their complete solution this any one may gather from the dialectics of

  pure reason which therefore has its good subjective grounds having acquired as

  regards the nature of our soul a clear conception of the subject and having come to

  the conviction that its manifestations cannot be explained materialistically who can

  refrain from asking what the soul really is and if no concept of experience suffices

  for the purpose from accounting for it by a concept of reason that of a simple

  immaterial being though we cannot by any means prove its objective reality who can

  satisfy himself with mere empirical knowledge in all the cosmological questions of the

  duration and of the quantity of the world of freedom or of natural necessity since

  every answer given on principles of experience begets a fresh question which likewise

  requires its answer and thereby clearly shows the insufficiency of all physical modes

  of explanation to satisfy reason finally who does not see in the thoroughgoing

  contingency and dependence of all his thoughts and assumptions on mere principles of

  experience the impossibility of stopping there and who does not feel himself

  compelled notwithstanding all interdictions against losing himself in transcendent

  ideas to seek rest and contentment beyond all the concepts which he can vindicate by

  experience in the concept of a being the possibility of which we cannot conceive but

  at the same time cannot be refuted because it relates to a mere being of the

  understanding and without it reason must needs remain forever dissatisfied
bounds in extended beings always presuppose a space existing

  outside a certain definite place and in closing it limits do not require this but

  are mere negations which affect a quantity so far as it is not absolutely complete

  but our reason as it were sees in its surroundings a space for the cognition of

  things in themselves though we can never have definite notions of them and are

  limited to appearances only
as long as the cognition of reason is homogeneous definite bounds

  to it are inconceivable in mathematics and in natural philosophy human reason admits

  of limits but not of bounds viz that something indeed lies without it at which it

  can never arrive but not that it will at any point find completion in its internal

  progress the enlarging of our views in mathematics and the possibility of new

  discoveries are infinite and the same is the case with the discovery of new

  properties of nature of new powers and laws by continued experience and its rational

  combination but limits cannot be mistaken here for mathematics refers to appearances

  only and what cannot be an object of sensuous contemplation such as the concepts of

  metaphysics and of morals lies entirely without its sphere and it can never lead to

  them neither does it require them it is therefore not a continual progress and an

  approximation towards these sciences and there is not as it were any point or line

  of contact natural science will never reveal to us the internal constitution of

  things which though not appearance yet can serve as the ultimate ground of explaining

  appearance nor does that science require this for its physical explanations nay even

  if such grounds should be offered from other sources for instance the influence of

  immaterial beings they must be rejected and not used in the progress of its

  explanations for these explanations must only be grounded upon that which as an object

  of sense can belong to experience and be brought into connexion with our actual

  perceptions and empirical laws
but metaphysics leads us towards bounds in the dialectical attempts

  of pure reason not undertaken arbitrarily or wantonly but stimulated thereto by the

  nature of reason itself and the transcendental ideas as they do not admit of

  evasion and are never capable of realisation serve to point out to us actually not

  only the bounds of the pure use of reason but also the way to determine them such is

  the end and the use of this natural predisposition of our reason which has brought

  forth metaphysics as its favorite child whose generation like every other in the

  world is not to be ascribed to blind chance but to an original germ wisely organised

  for great ends for metaphysics in its fundamental features perhaps more than any

  other science is placed in us by nature itself and cannot be considered the

  production of an arbitrary choice or a casual enlargement in the progress of experience

  from which it is quite disparate
reason with all its concepts and laws of the understanding which

  suffice for empirical use ie within the sensible world finds in itself no

  satisfaction because everrecurring questions deprive us of all hope of their complete

  solution the transcendental ideas which have that completion in view are such

  problems of reason but it sees clearly that the sensuous world cannot contain this

  completion neither consequently can all the concepts which serve merely for

  understanding the world of sense such as space and time and whatever we have adduced

  under the name of pure concepts of the understanding the sensuous world is nothing but

  a chain of appearances connected according to universal laws it has therefore no

  subsistence by itself it is not the thing in itself and consequently must point to

  that which contains the basis of this experience to beings which cannot be cognised

  merely as phenomena but as things in themselves in the cognition of them alone reason

  can hope to satisfy its desire of completeness in proceeding from the conditioned to

  its conditions
we have above  33 34 indicated the limits of reason with

  regard to all cognition of mere creations of thought now since the transcendental

  ideas have urged us to approach them and thus have led us as it were to the spot

  where the occupied space viz experience touches the void that of which we can know

  nothing viz noumena we can determine the bounds of pure reason for in all bounds

  there is something positive eg a surface is the boundary of corporeal space and is

  therefore itself a space a line is a space which is the boundary of the surface a

  point the boundary of the line but yet always a place in space whereas limits

  contain mere negations the limits pointed out in those paragraphs are not enough after

  we have discovered that beyond them there still lies something though we can never

  cognise what it is in itself for the question now is what is the attitude of our

  reason in this connexion of what we know with what we do not and never shall know

  this is an actual connexion of a known thing with one quite unknown and which will

  always remain so and though what is unknown should not become the least more

  knownwhich we cannot even hopeyet the notion of this connexion must be definite and

  capable of being rendered distinct
we must therefore accept an immaterial being a world of

  understanding and a supreme being all mere noumena because in them only as things

  in themselves reason finds that completion and satisfaction which it can never hope

  for in the derivation of appearances from their homogeneous grounds and because these

  actually have reference to something distinct from them and totally heterogeneous as

  appearances always presuppose an object in itself and therefore suggest its existence

  whether we can know more of it or not
but as we can never cognise these beings of understanding as they

  are in themselves that is definitely yet must assume them as regards the sensible

  world and connect them with it by reason we are at least able to think this connexion

  by means of such concepts as express their relation to the world of sense yet if we

  represent to ourselves a being of the understanding by nothing but pure concepts of the

  understanding we then indeed represent nothing definite to ourselves consequently our

  concept has no significance but if we think it by properties borrowed from the

  sensuous world it is no longer a being of understanding but is conceived as an

  appearance and belongs to the sensible world let us take an instance from the notion

  of the supreme being


    our deistic conception is quite a pure concept of reason but represents only a thing

    containing all realities without being able to determine any one of them because

    for that purpose an example must be taken from the world of sense in which case we

    should have an object of sense only not something quite heterogeneous which can

    never be an object of sense suppose i attribute to the supreme being understanding

    for instance i have no concept of an understanding other than my own one that must

    receive its perceptions anschauung by the senses and which

    is occupied in bringing them under rules of the unity of consciousness then the

    elements of my concept would always lie in the appearance i should however by the

    insufficiency of the appearance be necessitated to go beyond them to the concept of a

    being which neither depends upon appearance nor is bound up with them as conditions

    of its determination but if i separate understanding from sensibility to obtain a

    pure understanding then nothing remains but the mere form of thinking without

    perception anschauung by which form alone i can cognise

    nothing definite and consequently no object for that purpose i should conceive

    another understanding such as would directly perceive its objects39 but of which i have not the least

    notion because the human understanding is discursive and can not directly

    perceive it can only cognise by means of general concepts and the very same

    difficulties arise if we attribute a will to the supreme being for we have this

    concept only by drawing it from our internal experience and therefore from our

    dependence for satisfaction upon objects whose existence we require and so the

    notion rests upon sensibility which is absolutely incompatible with the pure concept

    of the supreme being

  
humes objections to deism are weak and affect only the proofs

  and not the deistic assertion itself but as regards theism which depends on a

  stricter determination of the concept of the supreme being which in deism is merely

  transcendent they are very strong and as this concept is formed in certain in fact

  in all common cases irrefutable hume always insists that by the mere concept of an

  original being to which we apply only ontological predicates eternity omnipresence

  omnipotence we think nothing definite and that properties which can yield a concept

  in concreto must be superadded that it is not enough to say

  it is cause but we must explain the nature of its causality for example that of an

  understanding and of a will he then begins his attacks on the essential point itself

  ie theism as he had previously directed his battery only against the proofs of

  deism an attack which is not very dangerous to it in its consequences all his

  dangerous arguments refer to anthropomorphism which he holds to be inseparable from

  theism and to make it absurd in itself but if the former be abandoned the latter

  must vanish with it and nothing remain but deism of which nothing can come which is

  of no value and which cannot serve as any foundation to religion or morals if this

  anthropomorphism were really unavoidable no proofs whatever of the existence of a

  supreme being even were they all granted could determine for us the concept of this

  being without involving us in contradictions


    if we connect with the command to avoid all transcendent judgments of pure reason

    the command which apparently conflicts with it to proceed to concepts that lie

    beyond the field of its immanent empirical use we discover that both can subsist

    together but only at the boundary of all lawful use of reason for this boundary

    belongs as well to the field of experience as to that of the creations of thought

    and we are thereby taught as well how these so remarkable ideas serve merely for

    marking the bounds of human reason on the one hand they give warning not boundlessly

    to extend cognition of experience as if nothing but

	world40 remained for us to cognise and yet

    on the other hand not to transgress the bounds of experience and to think of

    judging about things beyond them as things in themselves

  
but we stop at this boundary if we limit our judgment merely to the

  relation which the world may have to a being whose very concept lies beyond all the

  knowledge which we can attain within the world for we then do not attribute to the

  supreme being any of the properties in themselves by which we represent objects of

  experience and thereby avoid dogmatic anthropomorphism but we attribute them to his

  relation to the world and allow ourselves a symbolical anthropomorphism which in fact

  concerns language only and not the object itself
if i say that we are compelled to consider the world as if it were

  the work of a supreme understanding and will i really say nothing more than that a

  watch a ship a regiment bears the same relation to the watchmaker the shipbuilder

  the commanding officer as the world of sense or whatever constitutes the substratum

  of this complex of appearances does to the unknown which i do not hereby cognise as

  it is in itself but as it is for me or in relation to the world of which i am a

  part


     58  such a cognition is one of analogy and does not signify as is commonly

    understood an imperfect similarity of two things but a perfect similarity of

    relations between two quite dissimilar things41 by means of this

	analogy however there remains a concept of the supreme being sufficiently determined

	for us though we have left out everything that could deter mine it

    absolutely or in itself for we determine it as regards the world and as regards

    ourselves and more do we not require the attacks which hume makes upon those who

    would determine this concept absolutely by taking the materials for so doing from

    themselves and the world do not affect us and he cannot object to us that we have

    nothing left if we give up the objective anthropomorphism of the concept of the

    supreme being

  


    for let us assume at the outset as hume in his dialogues makes philo grant

    cleanthes as a necessary hypothesis the deistical concept of the first being in

    which this being is thought by the mere ontological predicates of substance of

    cause etc this must be done because reason actuated in the sensible world by mere

    conditions which are themselves always conditional cannot otherwise have any

    satisfaction and it therefore can be done without falling into anthropomorphism

    which transfers predicates from the world of sense to a being quite distinct from

    the world because those predicates are mere categories which though they do not

    give a determinate concept of god yet give a concept not limited to any conditions

    of sensibility thus nothing can prevent our predicating of this being a causality

    through reason with regard to the world and thus passing to theism without being

    obliged to attribute to god in himself this kind of reason as a property inhering in

    him for as to the former the only possible way of prosecuting the use of reason as

    regards all possible experience in complete harmony with itself in the world of

    sense to the highest point is to assume a supreme reason as a cause of all the

    connexions in the world such a principle must be quite advantageous to reason and

    can hurt it nowhere in its application to nature as to the latter reason is thereby

    not transferred as a property to the first being in himself but only to his relation

    to the world of sense and so anthropomorphism is entirely avoided for nothing is

    considered here but the cause of the form of reason which is perceived everywhere in

    the world and reason is attributed to the supreme being so far as it contains the

    ground of this form of reason in the world but according to analogy only that is

    so far as this expression shows merely the relation which the supreme cause unknown

    to us has to the world in order to determine everything in it conformably to reason

    in the highest degree we are thereby kept from using reason as an attribute for the

    purpose of conceiving god but instead of conceiving the world in such a manner as is

    necessary to have the greatest possible use of reason according to principle we

    thereby acknowledge that the supreme being is quite inscrutable and even unthinkable

    in any definite way as to what he is in himself we are thereby kept on the one

    hand from making a transcendent use of the concepts which we have of reason as an

    efficient cause by means of the will in order to determine the divine nature by

    properties which are only borrowed from human nature and from losing ourselves in

    gross and extravagant notions and on the other hand from deluging the contemplation

    of the world with hyperphysical modes of explanation according to our notions of

    human reason which we transfer to god and so losing for this contemplation its

    proper application according to which it should be a rational study of mere nature

    and not a presumptuous derivation of its appearances from a supreme reason the

    expression suited to our feeble notions is that we conceive the world as if it came

    as to its existence and internal plan from a supreme reason by which notion we both

    cognise the constitution which belongs to the world itself yet without pretending

    to determine the nature of its cause in itself and on the other hand we transfer

    the ground of this constitution of the form of reason in the world upon the

    relation of the supreme cause to the world without finding the world sufficient by

    itself for that purpose42

thus the difficulties which seem to oppose theism disappear by

  combining with humes principlenot to carry the use of reason dogmatically beyond the

  field of all possible experiencethis other principle which he quite overlooked not

  to consider the field of experience as one which bounds itself in the eye of our

  reason the critique of pure reason here points out the true

  mean between dogmatism which hume combats and skepticism which he would substitute

  for ita mean which is not like other means that we find advisable to determine for

  ourselves as it were mechanically by adopting something from one side and something

  from the other and by which nobody is taught a better way but such a one as can be

  accurately determined on principles
 59  at the beginning of this annotation i made use of the

  metaphor of a boundary in order to establish the limits of reason in regard to its

  suitable use the world of sense contains merely appearances which are not things in

  themselves but the understanding must assume these latter ones viz noumena in our

  reason both are comprised and the question is how does reason proceed to set

  boundaries to the understanding as regards both these fields experience which

  contains all that belongs to the sensuous world does not bound itself it only

  proceeds in every case from the conditioned to some other equally conditioned object

  its boundary must lie quite without it and this field is that of the pure beings of

  the understanding but this field so far as the determination of the nature of these

  beings is concerned is an empty space for us and if dogmaticallydetermined concepts

  alone are in question we cannot pass out of the field of possible experience but as a

  boundary itself is something positive which belongs as well to that which lies within

  as to the space that lies without the given complex it is still an actual positive

  cognition which reason only acquires by enlarging itself to this boundary yet without

  attempting to pass it because it there finds itself in the presence of an empty space

  in which it can conceive forms of things but not things themselves but the setting of

  a boundary to the field of the understanding by something which is otherwise unknown

  to it is still a cognition which belongs to reason even at this standpoint and by

  which it is neither confined within the sensible nor straying without it but only

  refers as befits the knowledge of a boundary to the relation between that which lies

  without it and that which is contained within it
natural theology is such a concept at the boundary of human reason

  being constrained to look beyond this boundary to the idea of a supreme being and for

  practical purposes to that of an intelligible world also not in order to determine

  anything relatively to this pure creation of the understanding which lies beyond the

  world of sense but in order to guide the use of reason within it according to

  principles of the greatest possible theoretical as well as practical unity for this

  purpose we make use of the reference of the world of sense to an independent reason as

  the cause of all its connexions thereby we do not purely invent a being but as

  beyond the sensible world there must be something that can only be thought by the pure

  understanding we determine that something in this particular way though only of

  course according to analogy
and thus there remains our original proposition which is the

  rsum of the whole critique that reason by all its a priori

  principles never teaches us anything more than objects of possible experience and even

  of these nothing more than can be cognised in experience but this limitation does not

  prevent reason leading us to the objective boundary of experience viz to the

  reference to something which is not itself an object of experience but is the ground

  of all experience reason does not however teach us anything concerning the thing in

  itself it only instructs us as regards its own complete and highest use in the field

  of possible experience but this is all that can be reasonably desired in the present

  case and with which we have cause to be satisfied
 60 thus we have fully exhibited metaphysics as it is actually

  given in the natural predisposition of human reason and in that which constitutes the

  essential end of its pursuit according to its subjective possibility though we have

  found that this merely natural use of such a predisposition of our reason if no

  discipline arising only from a scientific critique bridles and sets limits to it

  involves us in transcendent either apparently or really conflicting dialectical

  syllogisms and this fallacious metaphysics is not only unnecessary as regards the

  promotion of our knowledge of nature but even disadvantageous to it there yet remains

  a problem worthy of solution which is to find out the natural ends intended by this

  disposition to transcendent concepts in our reason because everything that lies in

  nature must be originally intended for some useful purpose
such an inquiry is of a doubtful nature and i acknowledge that

  what i can say about it is conjecture only like every speculation about the first ends

  of nature the question does not concern the objective validity of metaphysical

  judgments but our natural predisposition to them and therefore does not belong to the

  system of metaphysics but to anthropology
when i compare all the transcendental ideas the totality of which

  constitutes the particular problem of natural pure reason compelling it to quit the

  mere contemplation of nature to transcend all possible experience and in this

  endeavor to produce the thing be it knowledge or fiction called metaphysics i think

  i perceive that the aim of this natural tendency is to free our notions from the

  fetters of experience and from the limits of the mere contemplation of nature so far as

  at least to open to us a field containing mere objects for the pure understanding

  which no sensibility can reach not indeed for the purpose of speculatively occupying

  ourselves with them for there we can find no ground to stand on but because

  practical principles which without finding some such scope for their necessary

  expectation and hope could not expand to the universality which reason unavoidably

  requires from a moral point of view
so i find that the psychological idea however little it may reveal

  to me the nature of the human soul which is higher than all concepts of experience

  shows the insufficiency of these concepts plainly enough and thereby deters me from

  materialism the psychological notion of which is unfit for any explanation of nature

  and besides confines reason in practical respects the cosmological ideas by the

  obvious insufficiency of all possible cognition of nature to satisfy reason in its

  lawful inquiry serve in the same manner to keep us from naturalism which asserts

  nature to be sufficient for itself finally all natural necessity in the sensible

  world is conditional as it always presupposes the dependence of things upon others

  and unconditional necessity must be sought only in the unity of a cause different from

  the world of sense but as the causality of this cause in its turn were it merely

  nature could never render the existence of the contingent as its consequent

  comprehensible reason frees itself by means of the theological idea from fatalism

  both as a blind natural necessity in the coherence of nature itself without a first

  principle and as a blind causality of this principle itself and leads to the concept

  of a cause possessing freedom or of a supreme intelligence thus the transcendental

  ideas serve if not to instruct us positively at least to destroy the rash assertions

  of materialism of naturalism and of fatalism and thus to afford scope for the moral

  ideas beyond the field of speculation these considerations i should think explain in

  some measure the natural predisposition of which i spoke
the practical value which a merely speculative science may have

  lies without the bounds of this science and can therefore be considered as a scholion

  merely and like all scholia does not form part of the science itself this application

  however surely lies within the bounds of philosophy especially of philosophy drawn

  from the pure sources of reason where its speculative use in metaphysics must

  necessarily be at unity with its practical use in morals hence the unavoidable

  dialectics of pure reason considered in metaphysics as a natural tendency deserves

  to be explained not as an illusion merely which is to be removed but also if

  possible as a natural provision as regards its end though this duty a work of

  supererogation cannot justly be assigned to metaphysics proper


    the solutions of these questions which are treated in the chapter on the regulative

    use of the ideas of pure reason43 should

	be considered a second scholion

    which however has a greater affinity with the subject of metaphysics for there

    certain rational principles are expounded which determine a

    priori the order of nature or rather of the understanding which seeks

    natures laws through experience they seem to be constitutive and legislative with

    regard to experience though they spring from pure reason which cannot be

    considered like the understanding as a principle of possible experience now

    whether or not this harmony rests upon the fact that just as nature does not inhere

    in appearances or in their source the sensibility itself but only in so far as the

    latter is in relation to the understanding as also a systematic unity in applying

    the understanding to bring about an entirety of all possible experience can only

    belong to the understanding when in relation to reason and whether or not experience

    is in this way mediately subordinate to the legislation of reason may be discussed

    by those who desire to trace the nature of reason even beyond its use in metaphysics

    into the general principles of a history of nature i have represented this task as

    important but not attempted its solution in the book itself44

and thus i conclude the analytical solution of the main question

  which i had proposed how is metaphysics in general possible by ascending from the

  data of its actual use in its consequences to the grounds of its possibility
scholia
solution of the general question of the prolegomena how is metaphysics possible as a science
metaphysics as a natural disposition of reason is actual but if

  considered by itself alone as the analytical solution of the third principal question

  showed dialectical and illusory if we think of taking principles from it and in

  using them follow the natural but on that account not less false illusion we can

  never produce science but only a vain dialectical art in which one school may outdo

  another but none can ever acquire a just and lasting approbation
in order that as a science metaphysics may be entitled to claim not

  mere fallacious plausibility but in sight and conviction a critique

  of reason must itself exhibit the whole stock of a

  priori concepts their division according to their various sources sensibility

  understanding and reason together with a complete table of them the analysis of all

  these concepts with all their consequences especially by means of the deduction of

  these concepts the possibility of synthetical cognition a

  priori the principles of its application and finally its bounds all in a

  complete system critique therefore and critique alone contains in itself the whole

  wellproved and welltested plan and even all the means required to accomplish

  metaphysics as a science by other ways and means it is impossible the question here

  therefore is not so much how this performance is possible as how to set it going and

  induce men of clear heads to quit their hitherto perverted and fruitless cultivation

  for one that will not deceive and how such a union for the common end may best be

  directed
this much is certain that whoever has once tasted critique will be

  ever after disgusted with all dogmatical twaddle which he formerly put up with because

  his reason must have something and could find nothing better for its support
critique stands in the same relation to the common metaphysics of

  the schools as chemistry does to alchemy or as astronomy to the astrology of the

  fortuneteller i pledge myself that nobody who has read through and through and

  grasped the principles of the critique even in these prolegomena only will ever

  return to that old and sophistical pseudoscience but will rather with a certain

  delight look forward to metaphysics which is now indeed in his power requiring no more

  preparatory discoveries and now at last affording permanent satisfaction to reason

  for here is an advantage upon which of all possible sciences metaphysics alone can

  with certainty reckon that it can be brought to such completion and fixity as to be

  incapable of further change or of any augmentation by new discoveries because here

  reason has the sources of its knowledge in itself not in objects and their observation

  anschauung by which latter its stock of knowledge cannot be

  further increased when therefore it has exhibited the fundamental laws of its faculty

  completely and so definitely as to avoid all misunderstanding there remains nothing

  for pure reason to cognise a priori nay there is even no

  ground to raise further questions the sure prospect of knowledge so definite and so

  compact has a peculiar charm even though we should set aside all its advantages of

  which i shall hereafter speak
all false art all vain wisdom lasts its time but finally

  destroys itself and its highest culture is also the epoch of its decay that this time

  is come for metaphysics appears from the state into which it has fallen among all

  learned nations despite of all the zeal with which other sciences of every kind are

  prosecuted the old arrangement of our university studies still preserves its shadow

  now and then an academy of science tempts men by offering prizes to write essays on it

  but it is no longer numbered among thorough sciences and let any one judge for himself

  how a man of genius if he were called a great metaphysician would receive the

  compliment which may be wellmeant but is scarce envied by anybody
yet though the period of the downfall of all dogmatical

  metaphysics has undoubtedly arrived we are yet far from being able to say that the

  period of its regeneration is come by means of a thorough and

  complete critique of reason all transitions from

  a tendency to its contrary pass

  through the stage of indifference and this moment is the most dangerous for an author

  but in my opinion the most favorable for the science for when party spirit has died

  out by a total dissolution of former connexions minds are in the best state to listen

  to several proposals for an organisation according to a new plan
when i say that i hope these prolegomena

  will excite investigation in the field of critique and afford a new and promising

  object to sustain the general spirit of philosophy which seems on its speculative side

  to want sustenance i can imagine beforehand that every one whom the thorny paths of

  my critique have tired and put out of humor will ask me upon

  what i found this hope my answer is upon the irresistible law of necessity
that the human mind will ever give up metaphysical researches is as

  little to be expected as that we should prefer to give up breathing altogether to

  avoid inhaling impure air there will therefore always be metaphysics in the world

  nay every one especially every man of reflexion will have it and for want of a

  recognised standard will shape it for himself after his own pattern what has hitherto

  been called metaphysics cannot satisfy any critical mind but to forego it entirely is

  impossible therefore a critique of pure reason itself must now

  be attempted or if one exists investigated and brought to the full test because

  there is no other means of supplying this pressing want which is something more than

  mere thirst for knowledge
ever since i have come to know critique whenever i finish reading

  a book of metaphysical contents which by the preciseness of its notions by variety

  order and an easy style was not only entertaining but also helpful i cannot help

  asking has this author indeed advanced metaphysics a single step the learned men

  whose works have been useful to me in other respects and always contributed to the

  culture of my mental powers will i hope forgive me for saying that i have never

  been able to find either their essays or my own less important ones though selflove

  may recommend them to me to have advanced the science of metaphysics in the least and

  why
here is the very obvious reason metaphysics did not then exist as

  a science nor can it be gathered piecemeal but its germ must be fully preformed in

  the critique but in order to prevent all misconception we

  must remember what has been already said that by the analytical treatment of our

  concepts the understanding gains indeed a great deal but the science of metaphysics

  is thereby not in the least advanced because these dissections of concepts are nothing

  but the materials from which the intention is to carpenter our science let the

  concepts of substance and of accident be ever so well dissected and determined all

  this is very well as a preparation for some future use but if we cannot prove that in

  all which exists the substance endures and only the accidents vary our science is not

  the least advanced by all our analyses
metaphysics has hitherto never been able to

  prove a priori either this proposition

  or that of sufficient reason still less

  any more complex theorem such as belongs to psychology or cosmology or indeed any

  synthetical proposition by all its analysing therefore nothing is affected nothing

  obtained or forwarded and the science after all this bustle and noise still remains

  as it was in the days of aristotle though far better preparations were made for it

  than of old if the clue to synthetical cognitions had only been discovered
if any one thinks himself offended he is at liberty to refute my

  charge by producing a single synthetical proposition belonging to metaphysics which he

  would prove dogmatically a priori for until he has actually

  performed this feat i shall not grant that he has truly advanced the science even

  should this proposition be sufficiently confirmed by common experience no demand can

  be more moderate or more equitable and in the inevitably certain event of its

  nonperformance no assertion more just than that hitherto metaphysics has never

  existed as a science
but there are two things which in case the challenge be accepted

  i must deprecate first trifling about probability and conjecture which are suited as

  little to metaphysics as to geometry and secondly a decision by means of the magic

  wand of common sense which does not convince every one but which accommodates itself

  to personal peculiarities
for as to the former nothing can be more absurd than in

  metaphysics a philosophy from pure reason to think of grounding our judgments upon

  probability and conjecture everything that is to be cognised a

  priori is thereby announced as apodeictically certain and must therefore be

  proved in this way we might as well think of grounding geometry or arithmetic upon

  conjectures as to the doctrine of chances in the latter it does not contain probable

  but perfectly certain judgments concerning the degree of the probability of certain

  cases under given uniform conditions which in the sum of all possible cases

  infallibly happen according to the rule though it is not sufficiently determined in

  respect to every single chance conjectures by means of induction and of analogy can

  be suffered in an empirical science of nature only yet even there the possibility at

  least of what we assume must be quite certain
the appeal to common sense is even more absurd when concept and

  principles are announced as valid not in so far as they hold with regard to

  experience but even beyond the conditions of experience for what is common sense it

  is normal good sense so far it judges right but what is normal good sense it is the

  faculty of the knowledge and use of rules in concreto as

  distinguished from the speculative understanding which is a faculty of knowing rules

  in abstracto common sense can hardly understand the rule

  that every event is determined by means of its cause and can never comprehend it

  thus generally it therefore demands an example from experience and when it hears that

  this rule means nothing but what it always thought when a pane was broken or a

  kitchenutensil missing it then understands the principle and grants it common sense

  therefore is only of use so far as it can see its rules though they actually are

  a priori confirmed by experience consequently to comprehend

  them a priori or independently of experience belongs to the

  speculative understanding and lies quite beyond the horizon of common sense but the

  province of metaphysics is entirely confined to the latter kind of knowledge and it is

  certainly a bad index of common sense to appeal to it as a witness for it cannot here

  form any opinion whatever and men look down upon it with contempt until they are in

  difficulties and can find in their speculation neither in nor out
it is a common subterfuge of those false friends of common sense

  who occasionally prize it highly but usually despise it to say that there must

  surely be at all events some propositions which are immediately certain and of which

  there is no occasion to give any proof or even any account at all because we

  otherwise could never stop inquiring into the grounds of our judgments but if we

  except the principle of contradiction which is not sufficient to show the truth of

  synthetical judgments they can never adduce in proof of this privilege anything else

  indubitable which they can immediately ascribe to common sense except mathematical

  propositions such as twice two make four between two points there is but one straight

  line etc but these judgments are radically different from those of metaphysics for

  in mathematics i myself can by thinking construct whatever i represent to myself as

  possible by a concept i add to the first two the other two one by one and myself

  make the number four or i draw in thought from one point to another all manner of

  lines equal as well as unequal yet i can draw one only which is like itself in all

  its parts but i cannot by all my power of thinking extract from the concept of a

  thing the concept of something else whose existence is necessarily connected with the

  former but i must call in experience and though my understanding furnishes me

  a priori yet only in reference to possible experience with

  the concept of such a connexion ie causation i cannot exhibit it like the

  concepts of mathematics by anschauung visualising them

  a priori and so show its possibility a

  priori this concept together with the principles of its application always

  requires if it shall hold a priorias is requisite in

  metaphysicsa justification and deduction of its possibility because we cannot

  otherwise know how far it holds good and whether it can be used in experience only or

  beyond it also
therefore in metaphysics as a speculative science of pure reason

  we can never appeal to common sense but may do so only when we are forced to surrender

  it and to renounce all purely speculative cognition which must always be knowledge

  and consequently when we forego metaphysics itself and its instruction for the sake of

  adopting a rational faith which alone may be possible for us and sufficient to our

  wants perhaps even more salutary than knowledge itself for in this case the attitude

  of the question is quite altered metaphysics must be science not only as a whole but

  in all its parts otherwise it is nothing because as a speculation of pure reason it

  finds a hold only on general opinions beyond its field however probability and

  common sense may be used with advantage and justly but on quite special principles of

  which the importance always depends on the reference to practical life
this is what i hold myself justified in requiring for the

  possibility of metaphysics as a science
appendix
on what can be done to make metaphysics actual as a science
since all the ways heretofore taken have failed to attain the goal

  and since without a preceding critique of pure reason it is not likely ever to be

  attained the present essay now before the public has a fair title to an accurate and

  careful investigation except it be thought more advisable to give up all pretensions

  to metaphysics to which if men but would consistently adhere to their purpose no

  objection can be made
if we take the course of things as it is not as it ought to be

  there are two sorts of judgments 1 one a judgment which precedes investigation in

  our case one in which the reader from his own metaphysics pronounces judgment on the

  critique of pure reason which was intended to discuss the very

  possibility of metaphysics 2 the other a judgment subsequent to investigation in

  the latter the reader is enabled to waive for awhile the consequences of the critical

  researches that may be repugnant to his formerly adopted metaphysics and first

  examines the grounds whence those consequences are derived if what common metaphysics

  propounds were demonstrably certain as for instance the theorems of geometry the

  former way of judging would hold good for if the consequences of certain principles

  are repugnant to established truths these principles are false and without further

  inquiry to be repudiated but if metaphysics does not possess a stock of indisputably

  certain synthetical propositions and should it even be the case that there are a

  number of them which though among the most specious are by their consequences in

  mutual collision and if no sure criterion of the truth of peculiarly metaphysical

  synthetical propositions is to be met with in it then the former way of judging is

  not admissible but the investigation of the principles of the critique must precede

  all judgments as to its value
on a specimen of a judgment of the

  critique prior to its examination
this judgment is to be found in the gttingischen gelehrten

  anzeigen in the supplement to the third division of january 19 1782

  pages 40 et seq
when an author who is familiar with the subject of his work and

  endeavors to present his independent reflexions in its elaboration falls into the

  hands of a reviewer who in his turn is keen enough to discern the points on which the

  worth or worthlessness of the book rests who does not cling to words but goes to the

  heart of the subject sifting and testing more than the mere principles which the

  author takes as his point of departure the severity of the judgment may indeed

  displease the latter but the public does not care as it gains thereby and the author

  himself may be contented as an opportunity of correcting or explaining his positions

  is afforded to him at an early date by the examination of a competent judge in such a

  manner that if he believes himself fundamentally right he can remove in time any

  stone of offence that might hurt the success of his work
i find myself with my reviewer in quite another position he

  seems not to see at all the real matter of the investigation with which successfully

  or unsuccessfully i have been occupied it is either impatience at thinking out a

  lengthy work or vexation at a threatened reform of a science in which he believed he

  had brought everything to perfection long ago or what i am unwilling to imagine real

  narrowmindedness that prevents him from ever carrying his thoughts beyond his

  schoolmetaphysics in short he passes impatiently in review a long series of

  propositions by which without knowing their premises we can think nothing

  intersperses here and there his censure the reason of which the reader understands

  just as little as the propositions against which it is directed and hence his report

  can neither serve the public nor damage me in the judgment of experts i should for

  these reasons have passed over this judgment altogether were it not that it may

  afford me occasion for some explanations which may in some cases save the readers of

  these prolegomena from a misconception
in order to take a position from which my reviewer could most

  easily set the whole work in a most unfavorable light without venturing to trouble

  himself with any special investigation he begins and ends by saying


    this work is a system of transcendent or as he translates it of higher

    idealism45

a glance at this line soon showed me the sort of criticism that i

  had to expect much as though the reviewer were one who had never seen or heard of

  geometry having found a euclid and coming upon various figures in turning over its

  leaves were to say on being asked his opinion of it the work is a textbook of

  drawing the author introduces a peculiar terminology in order to give dark

  incomprehensible directions which in the end teach nothing more than what every one

  can effect by a fair natural accuracy of eye etc
let us see in the meantime what sort of an idealism it is that

  goes through my whole work although it does not by a long way constitute the soul of

  the system
the dictum of all genuine idealists from the eleatic school to

  bishop berkeley is contained in this formula all cognition through the senses and

  experience is nothing but sheer illusion and only in the ideas of the pure

  understanding and reason there is truth
the principle that throughout dominates and determines my idealism

  is on the contrary all cognition of things merely from pure understanding or pure

  reason is nothing but sheer illusion and only in experience is there truth
but this is directly contrary to idealism proper how came i then

  to use this expression for quite an opposite purpose and how came my reviewer to see

  it everywhere


    the solution of this difficulty rests on something that could have been very easily

    understood from the general bearing of the work if the reader had only desired to do

    so space and time together with all that they contain are not things nor qualities

    in themselves but belong merely to the appearances of the latter up to this point i

    am one in confession with the above idealists but these and amongst them more

    particularly berkeley regarded space as a mere empirical presentation that like the

    phenomenon it contains is only known to us by means of experience or perception

    together with its determinations i on the contrary prove in the first place that

    space and also time which berkeley did not consider and all its determinations

    a priori can be cognised by us because no less than time

    it inheres in our sensibility as a pure form before all perception or experience and

    makes all intuition of the same and therefore all its phenomena possible it

    follows from this that as truth rests on universal and necessary laws as its

    criteria experience according to berkeley can have no criteria of truth because

    its phenomena according to him have nothing a priori at

    their foundation whence it follows that they are nothing but sheer illusion

    whereas with us space and time in conjunction with the pure conceptions of the

    understanding prescribe their law to all possible experience a

    priori and at the same time afford the certain

    criterion for distinguishing truth from illusion therein46

my socalled properly critical idealism is of quite a special

  character in that it subverts the ordinary idealism and that through it all cognition

  a priori even that of geometry first receives objective

  reality which without my demonstrated ideality of space and time could not be

  maintained by the most zealous realists this being the state of the case i could have

  wished in order to avoid all misunderstanding to have named this conception of mine

  otherwise but to alter it altogether was impossible it may be permitted me however

  in future as has been above intimated to term it the formal or better still the

  critical idealism to distinguish it from the dogmatic idealism of berkeley and from

  the sceptical idealism of descartes


    beyond this i find nothing further remarkable in the judgment of my book the

    reviewer criticises here and there makes sweeping criticisms a mode prudently

    chosen since it does not betray ones own knowledge or ignorance a single thorough

    criticism in detail had it touched the main question as is only fair would have

    exposed it may be my error or it may be my reviewers measure of insight into this

    species of research it was moreover not a badly conceived plan in order at once

    to take from readers who are accustomed to form their conceptions of books from

    newspaper reports the desire to read the book itself to pour out in one breath a

    number of passages in succession torn from their connexion and their grounds of

    proof and explanations and which must necessarily sound senseless especially

    considering how antipathetic they are to all schoolmetaphysics to exhaust the

    readers patience ad nauseam and then after having made me

    acquainted with the sensible proposition that persistent illusion is truth to

    conclude with the crude paternal moralisation to what end then the quarrel with

    accepted language to what end and whence the idealistic distinction a judgment

    which seeks all that is characteristic of my book first supposed to be

    metaphysically heterodox in a mere innovation of the nomenclature proves clearly

    that my wouldbe judge has understood nothing of the subject and in addition has

    not understood himself47

my reviewer speaks like a man who is conscious of important and

  superior insight which he keeps hidden for i am aware of nothing recent with respect

  to metaphysics that could justify his tone but he should not withhold his discoveries

  from the world for there are doubtless many who like myself have not been able to

  find in all the fine things that have for long past been written in this department

  anything that has advanced the science by so much as a fingerbreadth we find indeed

  the giving a new point to definitions the supplying of lame proofs with new crutches

  the adding to the crazyquilt of metaphysics fresh patches or changing its pattern but

  all this is not what the world requires the world is tired of metaphysical assertions

  it wants the possibility of the science the sources from which certainty therein can

  be derived and certain criteria by which it may distinguish the dialectical illusion

  of pure reason from truth to this the critic seems to possess a key otherwise he

  would never have spoken out in such a high tone
but i am inclined to suspect that no such requirement of the

  science has ever entered his thoughts for in that case he would have directed his

  judgment to this point and even a mistaken attempt in such an important matter would

  have won his respect if that be the case we are once more good friends he may

  penetrate as deeply as he likes into metaphysics without any one hindering him only

  as concerns that which lies outside metaphysics its sources which are to be found in

  reason he cannot form a judgment that my suspicion is not without foundation is

  proved by the fact that he does not mention a word about the possibility of synthetic

  knowledge a priori the special problem upon the solution of

  which the fate of metaphysics wholly rests and upon which my critique as well

  as the present prolegomena

  entirely hinges the idealism he encountered and which he hung upon was only taken up

  in the doctrine as the sole means of solving the above problem although it received

  its confirmation on other grounds and hence he must have shown either that the above

  problem does not possess the importance i attribute to it even in these prolegomena or

  that by my conception of appearances it is either not

  solved at all or can be better solved in another way but i do not find a word of this

  in the criticism the reviewer then understands nothing of my work and possibly also

  nothing of the spirit and essential nature of metaphysics itself and it is not what i

  would rather assume the hurry of a man incensed at the labor of plodding through so

  many obstacles that threw an unfavorable shadow over the work lying before him and

  made its fundamental features unrecognisable
there is a good deal to be done before a learned journal it

  matters not with what care its writers may be selected can maintain its otherwise

  wellmerited reputation in the field of metaphysics as elsewhere other sciences and

  branches of knowledge have their standard mathematics has it in itself history and

  theology in profane or sacred books natural science and the art of medicine in

  mathematics and experience jurisprudence in law books and even matters of taste in

  the examples of the ancients but for the judgment of the thing called metaphysics the

  standard has yet to be found i have made an attempt to determine it as well as its

  use what is to be done then until it be found when works of this kind have to be

  judged of if they are of a dogmatic character one may do what one likes no one will

  play the master over others here for long before someone else appears to deal with him

  in the same manner if however they are critical in their character not indeed with

  reference to other works but to reason itself so that the standard of judgment cannot

  be assumed but has first of all to be sought for then though objection and blame may

  indeed be permitted yet a certain degree of leniency is indispensable since the need

  is common to us all and the lack of the necessary insight makes the highhanded

  attitude of judge unwarranted
in order however to connect my defence with the interest of the

  philosophical commonwealth i propose a test which must be decisive as to the mode

  whereby all metaphysical investigations may be directed to their common purpose this

  is nothing more than what formerly mathematicians have done in establishing the

  advantage of their methods by competition i challenge my critic to demonstrate as is

  only just on a priori grounds in his way a single really

  metaphysical principle asserted by him being metaphysical it must be synthetic and

  cognised a priori from conceptions but it may also be any one

  of the most indispensable principles as for instance the principle of the persistence

  of substance or of the necessary determination of events in the world by their causes

  if he cannot do this silence however is confession he must admit that as

  metaphysics without apodeictic certainty of propositions of this kind is nothing at

  all its possibility or impossibility must before all things be established in a

  critique of the pure reason thus he is bound either to confess that my principles in

  the critique are correct or he must prove their invalidity

  but as i can already foresee that confidently as he has hitherto relied on the

  certainty of his principles when it comes to a strict test he will not find a single

  one in the whole range of metaphysics he can bring forward i will concede to him an

  advantageous condition which can only be expected in such a competition and will

  relieve him of the onus probandi by laying it on myself
he finds in these prolegomena and in my

  critique chapter on the theses and antitheses of the four

  antinomies eight propositions of which two and two contradict one another but each

  of which necessarily belongs to metaphysics by which it must either be accepted or

  rejected although there is not one that has not in this time been held by some

  philosopher now he has the liberty of selecting any one of these eight propositions

  at his pleasure and accepting it without any proof of which i shall make him a

  present but only one for waste of time will be just as little serviceable to him as

  to me and then of attacking my proof of the opposite proposition if i can save this

  one and at the same time show that according to principles which every dogmatic

  metaphysics must necessarily recognise the opposite of the proposition adopted by him

  can be just as clearly proved it is thereby established that metaphysics has an

  hereditary failing not to be explained much less set aside until we ascend to its

  birthplace pure reason itself and thus my critique must

  either be accepted or a better one take its place it must at least be studied which

  is the only thing i now require if on the other hand i cannot save my demonstration

  then a synthetic proposition a priori from dogmatic principles

  is to be reckoned to the score of my opponent then also i will deem my impeachment of

  ordinary metaphysics as unjust and pledge myself to recognise his stricture on my

  critique as justified although this would not be the

  consequence by a long way to this end it would be necessary it seems to me that he

  should step out of his incognito otherwise i do not see how it could be avoided that

  instead of dealing with one i should be honored by several problems coming from

  anonymous and unqualified opponents
proposals as to an investigation of the critique upon which a

  judgment may follow
i feel obliged to the honored public even for the silence with

  which it for a long time favored my critique for this proves

  at least a postponement of judgment and some supposition that in a work leaving all

  beaten tracks and striking out on a new path in which one cannot at once perhaps so

  easily find ones way something may perchance lie from which an important but at

  present dead branch of human knowledge may derive new life and productiveness hence

  may have originated a solicitude for the as yet tender shoot lest it be destroyed by a

  hasty judgment a test of a judgment delayed for the above reasons is now before my

  eye in the gothaischen gelehrten zeitung the thoroughness of

  which every reader will himself perceive from the clear and unperverted presentation

  of a fragment of one of the first principles of my work without taking into

  consideration my own suspicious praise
and now i propose since an extensive structure cannot be judged of

  as a whole from a hurried glance to test it piece by piece from its foundations so

  thereby the present prolegomena may fitly be used as a general

  outline with which the work itself may occasionally be compared this notion if it

  were founded on nothing more than my conceit of importance such as vanity commonly

  attributes to ones own productions would be immodest and would deserve to be

  repudiated with disgust but now the interests of speculative philosophy have arrived

  at the point of total extinction while human reason hangs upon them with

  inextinguishable affection and only after having been ceaselessly deceived does it

  vainly attempt to change this into indifference
in our thinking age it is not to be supposed but that many

  deserving men would use any good opportunity of working for the common interest of the

  more and more enlightened reason if there were only some hope of attaining the goal

  mathematics natural science laws arts even morality etc do not completely fill

  the soul there is always a space left over reserved for pure and speculative reason

  the vacuity of which prompts us to seek in vagaries buffooneries and myticism for

  what seems to be employment and entertainment but what actually is mere pastime in

  order to deaden the troublesome voice of reason which in accordance with its nature

  requires something that can satisfy it and not merely subserve other ends or the

  interests of our inclinations a consideration therefore which is concerned only with

  reason as it exists for it itself has as i may reasonably suppose a great fascination

  for every one who has attempted thus to extend his conceptions and i may even say a

  greater than any other theoretical branch of knowledge for which he would not

  willingly exchange it because here all other cognitions and even purposes must meet

  and unite themselves in a whole
i offer therefore these prolegomena as a

  sketch and textbook for this investigation and not the work itself although i am

  even now perfectly satisfied with the latter as far as contents order and mode of

  presentation and the care that i have expended in weighing and testing every sentence

  before writing it down are concerned for it has taken me years to satisfy myself

  fully not only as regards the whole but in some cases even as to the sources of one

  particular proposition yet i am not quite satisfied with my exposition in some

  sections of the doctrine of elements as for instance in the deduction of the

  conceptions of the understanding or in that on the paralogisms of pure reason because

  a certain diffuseness takes away from their clearness and in place of them what is

  here said in the prolegomena respecting these sections may be

  made the basis of the test
it is the boast of the germans that where steady and continuous

  industry are requisite they can carry things farther than other nations if this

  opinion be well founded an opportunity a business presents itself the successful

  issue of which we can scarcely doubt and in which all thinking men can equally take

  part though they have hitherto been unsuccessful in accomplishing it and in thus

  confirming the above good opinion but this is chiefly because the science in question

  is of so peculiar a kind that it can be at once brought to completion and to that

  enduring state that it will never be able to be brought in the least degree farther or

  increased by later discoveries or even changed leaving here out of account adornment

  by greater clearness in some places or additional uses and this is an advantage no

  other science has or can have because there is none so fully isolated and independent

  of others and which is concerned with the faculty of cognition pure and simple and

  the present moment seems moreover not to be unfavorable to my expectation for just

  now in germany no one seems to know wherewith to occupy himself apart from the

  socalled useful sciences so as to pursue not mere play but a business possessing an

  enduring purpose
to discover the means how the endeavors of the learned may be

  united in such a purpose i must leave to others in the meantime it is my intention

  to persuade any one merely to follow my propositions or even to flatter me with the

  hope that he will do so but attacks repetitions limitations or confirmation

  completion and extension as the case may be should be appended if the matter be but

  investigated from its foundation it cannot fail that a system albeit not my own

  shall be erected that shall be a possession for future generations for which they may

  have reason to be grateful
it would lead us too far here to show what kind of metaphysics may

  be expected when only the principles of criticism have been perfected and how

  because the old false feathers have been pulled out she need by no means appear poor

  and reduced to an insignificant figure but may be in other respects richly and

  respectably adorned but other and great uses which would result from such a reform

  strike one immediately the ordinary metaphysics had its uses in that it sought out

  the elementary conceptions of the pure understanding in order to make them clear

  through analysis and definite by explanation in this way it was a training for

  reason in whatever direction it might be turned but this was all the good it did

  service was subsequently effaced when it favored conceit by venturesome assertions

  sophistry by subtle distinctions and adornment and shallowness by the ease with which

  it decided the most difficult problems by means of a little schoolwisdom which is

  only the more seductive the more it has the choice on the one hand of taking

  something from the language of science and on the other from that of popular

  discourse thus being everything to everybody but in reality nothing at all by

  criticism however a standard is given to our judgment whereby knowledge may be with

  certainty distinguished from pseudoscience and firmly founded being brought into

  full operation in metaphysics a mode of thought extending by degrees its beneficial

  influence over every other use of reason at once infusing into it the true

  philosophical spirit but the service also that metaphysics performs for theology by

  making it independent of the judgment of dogmatic speculation thereby assuring it

  completely against the attacks of all such opponents is certainly not to be valued

  lightly for ordinary metaphysics although it promised the latter much advantage

  could not keep this promise and moreover by summoning speculative dogmatics to its

  assistance did nothing but arm enemies against itself mysticism which can prosper in

  a rationalistic age only when it hides itself behind a system of schoolmetaphysics

  under the protection of which it may venture to rave with a semblance of rationality

  is driven from this its last hidingplace by critical philosophy last but not

  least it cannot be otherwise than important to a teacher of metaphysics to be able to

  say with universal assent that what he expounds is science and that thereby genuine

  services will be rendered to the commonweal

6  nevertheless hume

  called this very destructive science metaphysics and attached to it great value

  metaphysics and morals he declares in the fourth part of his essays are the most

  important branches of science mathematics and physics are not nearly so

  important but the acute man merely

  regarded the negative use arising from the moderation of extravagant claims of

  speculative reason and the complete settlement of the many endless and troublesome

  controversies that mislead mankind he overlooked the positive injury which results if

  reason be deprived of its most important prospects which can alone supply to the will

7  the term anschauung here

  used means senseperception it is that which is given to the senses and apprehended

  immediately as an object is seen by merely looking at it the translation intuition

  though etymologically correct is misleading in the present

  passage the term is not used in its technical significance but means practical

  experienceed 
8  the term apodeictic is

  borrowed by kant from aristotle who uses it in the sense of certain beyond dispute

  the word is derived from   i

  show and is contrasted to dialectic propositions ie such statements as

  admit of controversyed 
9  it is unavoidable that as knowledge

  advances certain expressions which have become classical after having been used since

  the infancy of science will be found inadequate and unsuitable and a newer and more

  appropriate application of the terms will give rise to confusion this is the case

  with the term analytical the analytical method so far as it is opposed to the

  synthetical is very different from that which constitutes the essence of analytical

  propositions it signifies only that we start from what is sought as if it were given

  and ascend to the only conditions under which it is possible in this method we often

  use nothing but synthetical propositions as in mathematical analysis and it were

  better to term it the regressive method in contradistinction to the synthetic or

  progressive a principal part of logic too is distinguished by the name of analytics

  which here signifies the logic of truth in contrast to dialectics without considering

  whether the cognitions belonging to it are analytical or synthetical 
10  this whole paragraph  9

  will be better understood when compared with remark i following

  this section appearing in the present edition on page 40ed

   
11  empirical judgments empirische urtheile

  are either mere statements of fact viz records of a

  perception or statements of a natural law implying a causal connexion between two

  facts the former kant calls judgments of perception wahrnehmungsurtheile the latter judgments of experience erhfahrungsurtheileed 
12  i freely grant that these examples

  do not represent such judgments of perception as ever could become judgments of

  experience even though a concept of the understanding were superadded because they

  refer merely to feeling which everybody knows to be merely subjective and which of

  course can never be attributed to the object and consequently never become objective

  i only wished to give here an example of a judgment that is merely subjectively valid

  containing no ground for universal validity and thereby for a relation to the object

  an example of the judgments of perception which become judgments of experience by

  superadded concepts of the understanding will be given in the next note 
13  as an easier example we may take

  the following when the sun shines on the stone it grows warm this judgment

  however often i and others may have perceived it is a mere judgment of perception and

  contains no necessity perceptions are only usually conjoined in this manner but if i

  say the sun warms the stone i add to the perception a concept of the understanding

  viz that of cause which connects with the concept of sunshine that of heat as a

  necessary consequence and the synthetical judgment becomes of necessity universally

  valid viz objective and is converted from a perception into experience 
14  this name seems preferable to the

  term particularia which is used for these judgments in logic

  for the latter implies the idea that they are not universal but when i start from

  unity in single judgments and so proceed to universality i must not even indirectly

  and negatively imply any reference to universality i think plurality merely without

  universality and not the exception from universality this is necessary if logical

  considerations shall form the basis of the pure concepts of the understanding however

  there is no need of making changes in logic 
15  but how does this proposition

  that judgments of experience contain necessity in the synthesis of perceptions agree

  with my statement so often before inculcated that experience as cognition

  a posteriori can afford contingent judgments only when i say

  that experience teaches me something i mean only the perception that lies in

  experiencefor example that heat always follows the shining of the sun on a stone

  consequently the proposition of experience is always so far accidental that this heat

  necessarily follows the shining of the sun is contained indeed in the judgment of

  experience by means of the concept of cause yet is a fact not learned by experience

  for conversely experience is first of all generated by this addition of the concept of

  the understanding of cause to perception how perception attains this addition may be

  seen by referring in the critique itself to the section on the

  transcendental faculty of judgment viz in the first edition von

  dem schematismus der reinen verstandsbegriffe 
16  kant uses the term physiological

  in its etymological meaning as pertaining to the science of physics ie nature in

  general not as we use the term now as pertaining to the functions of the living

  body accordingly it has been translated physicaled 
17  the three following paragraphs will

  hardly be understood unless reference be made to what the critique itself

  says on the subject of the principles they will however

  be of service in giving a general view of the principles and in fixing the attention

  on the main points 
18  kant uses here the equivocal term

  wechselwirkunged 
19  heat and light are in a small space

  just as large as to degree as in a large one in like manner the internal

  representations pain consciousness in general whether they last a short or a long

  time need not vary as to the degree hence the quantity is here in a point and in a

  moment just as great as in any space or time however great degrees are therefore

  capable of increase but not in intuition rather in mere sensation or the quantity of

  the degree of an intuition hence they can only be estimated quantitatively by the

  relation of 1 to 0 viz by their capability of decreasing by infinite intermediate

  degrees to disappearance or of increasing from naught through infinite gradations to a

  determinate sensation in a certain time quantitas qualitatis est

  gradus ie the degrees of quality must be measured by equality 
20  we speak of the intelligible

  world not as the usual expression is intellectual world for cognitions are

  intellectual through the understanding and refer to our world of sense also but

  objects so far as they can be represented merely by the understanding and to which

  none of our sensible intuitions can refer are termed intelligible but as some

  possible intuition must correspond to every object we would have to assume an

  understanding that intuites things immediately but of such we have not the least

  notion nor have we of the things of the understanding

  verstandeswesen to which it should be applied 
21  crusius alone thought of a

  compromise that a spirit who can neither err nor deceive implanted these laws in us

  originally but since false principles often intrude themselves as indeed the very

  system of this man shows in not a few examples we are involved in difficulties as to

  the use of such a principle in the absence of sure criteria to distinguish the genuine

  origin from the spurious as we never can know certainly what the spirit of truth or

  the father of lies may have instilled into us 
22  the definition of nature is given

  in the beginning of the second part of the transcendental problem in  14 
23  1 substantia 2 qualitas 3 quantitas 4 relatio 5 actio 6 passio 7 quando 8 ubi 9 situs

  10 habitus 
24  oppositum

  prius simul motus habere

   
25  see the two tables in the chapters

  von den paralogismen der reinen vernuuft and the first division

  of the antinomy of pure reason system der kosmologischen

  ideen 
26  on the table of the categories many

  neat observations may be made for instance 1 that the third arises from the first

  and the second joined in one concept 2 that in those of quantity and of quality

  there is merely a progress from unity to totality or from something to nothing for

  this purpose the categories of quality must stand thus reality limitation total

  negation without correlata or opposita whereas

  those of relation and of modality have them 3 that as

  in logic categorical judgments are the basis of all others so

  the category of substance is the basis of all concepts of actual things 4 that as

  modality in the judgment is not a particular predicate so by the modal concepts a

  determination is not superadded to things etc etc such observations are of great

  use if we besides enumerate all the predicables which we can find pretty completely

  in any good ontology for example baumgartens and arrange them in classes under the

  categories in which operation we must not neglect to add as complete a dissection of

  all these concepts as possible there will then arise a merely analytical part of

  metaphysics which does not contain a single synthetical proposition which might

  precede the second the synthetical and would by its precision and completeness be

  not only useful but in virtue of its system be even to some extent elegant 
27  see critique of

  pure reason von der amphibolie der reflexbegriffe 
28  if we can say that a science is

  actual at least in the ideas of all men as soon as it appears that the problems which

  lead to it are proposed to everybody by the nature of human reason and that therefore

  many though faulty endeavors are unavoidably made in its behalf then we are bound to

  say that metaphysics is subjectively and indeed necessarily actual and therefore we

  justly ask how is it objectively possible 
29  in disjunctive judgments we

  consider all possibility as divided in respect to a particular concept by the

  ontological principle of the universal determination of a thing in general i

  understand the principle that either the one or the other of all possible contradictory

  predicates must be assigned to any object this is at the same time the principle of

  all disjunctive judgments constituting the foundation of our conception of

  possibility and in it the possibility of every object in general is considered as

  determined this may serve as a slight explanation of the above proposition that the

  activity of reason in disjunctive syllogisms is formally the same as that by which it

  fashions the idea of a universal conception of all reality containing in itself that

  which is positive in all contradictory predicates 
30  see critique of

  pure reason von den paralogismen der reinen vernunft 
31  were the representation of the

  apperception the ego a concept by which anything could be thought it could be used

  as a predicate of other things or contain predicates in itself but it is nothing more

  than the feeling of an existence without the least definite conception and is only the

  representation of that to which all thinking stands in relation relatione accidentis

   
32  cf critique von den

  analogien der erfahrung 
33  it is indeed very remarkable how

  carelessly metaphysicians have always passed over the principle of the permanence of

  substances without ever attempting a proof of it doubtless because they found

  themselves abandoned by all proofs as soon as they began to deal with the concept of

  substance common sense which felt distinctly that without this presupposition do

  union of perceptions in experience is possible supplied the want by a postulate from

  experience itself it never could derive such a principle partly because substances

  cannot be so traced in all their alterations and dissolutions that the matter can

  always be found undiminished partly because the principle contains

  necessity which is always the sign of an a priori

  principle people then boldly applied this postulate to the concept of soul as a

  substance and concluded a necessary continuance of the soul

  after the death of man especially as the simplicity of this substance which is

  inferred from the indivisibility of consciousness secured it from destruction by

  dissolution had they found the genuine source of this principlea discovery which

  requires deeper researches than they were ever inclined to makethey would have seen

  that the law of the permanence of substances has place for the purposes of experience

  only and hence can hold good of things so far as they are to be cognised and conjoined

  with others in experience but never independently of all possible experience and

  consequently cannot hold good of the soul after death 
34  cf critique die

  antinomie der reinen vernunft 
35  i therefore would be pleased to

  have the critical reader to devote to this antinomy of pure reason his chief attention

  because nature itself seems to have established it with a view to stagger reason in its

  daring pretentions and to force it to selfexamination for every proof which i have

  given as well of the thesis as of the antithesis i undertake to be responsible and

  thereby to show the certainty of the inevitable antinomy of reason when the reader is

  brought by this curious phenomenon to fall back upon the proof of the presumption upon

  which it rests he will feel himself obliged to investigate the ultimate foundation of

  all the cognition of pure reason with me more thoroughly 
36  the idea of freedom occurs only in

  the relation of the intellectual as cause to the appearance as effect hence we

  cannot attribute freedom to matter in regard to the incessant action by which it fills

  its space though this action takes place from an internal principle we can likewise

  find no notion of freedom suitable to purely rational beings for instance to god so

  far as his action is immanent for his action though independent of external

  determining causes is determined in his eternal reason that is in the divine

  nature it is only if something is to

  start by an action and so the effect occurs in the sequence of time or in the

  world of sense eg the beginning of the world that we can put the question

  whether the causality of the cause must in its turn have been started or whether the

  cause can originate an effect without its causality itself beginning in the former

  case the concept of this causality is a concept of natural necessity in the latter

  that of freedom from this the reader will see that as i explained freedom to be the

  faculty of starting an event spontaneously i have exactly hit the notion which is the

  problem of metaphysics 
37  cf critique the chapter on transcendental ideals

   
38  herr platner in his aphorisms

  acutely says  728 729 if reason be a criterion no concept which is

  incomprehensible to human reason can be possible incomprehensibility has place in

  what is actual only here in comprehensibility arises from the insufficiency of the

  acquired ideas it sounds paradoxical but is otherwise not strange to say that in

  nature there is much incomprehensible eg the faculty of generation but if we mount

  still higher and even go beyond nature everything again becomes comprehensible for

  we then quit entirely the objects which can be given us and occupy ourselves merely

  about ideas in which occupation we can easily comprehend the law that reason

  prescribes by them to the understanding for its use in experience because the law is

  the reasons own production 
39  der die

  gegenstnde anschaute 
40  the use of the word world without

  article though odd seems to be the correct reading but it may be a mere misprint

  ed 
41  there is eg an analogy between

  the juridical relation of human actions and the mechanical relation of motive powers i

  never can do anything to another man without giving him a right to do the same to me on

  the same conditions just as no mass can act with its motive power on another mass

  without thereby occasioning the other to react equally against it here right and

  motive power are quite dissimilar things but in their relation there is complete

  similarity by means of such an analogy i can obtain a notion of the relation of things

  which absolutely are unknown to me for instance as the promotion of the welfare of

  children  a is to the love of parents  b so the welfare of the human species 

  c is to that unknown quantity which is in god  x which we call love not as if

  it had the least similarity to any human inclination but because we can suppose its

  relation to the world to be similar to that which things of the world bear one another

  but the concept of relation in this case is a mere category viz the concept of

  cause which has nothing to do with sensibility 
42  i may say that the causality of

  the supreme cause holds the same place with regard to the world that human reason does

  with regard to its works of art here the nature of the supreme cause itself remains

  unknown to me i only compare its effects the order of the world which i know and

  their conformity to reason to the effects of human reason which i also know and hence

  i term the former reason without attributing to it on that account what i understand

  in man by this term or attaching to it anything else known to me as its property

   
43  critique of pure

  reason ii chap iii section 7 
44  throughout in the critique

  i never lost sight of the plan not to neglect anything were it

  ever so recondite that could render the inquiry into the nature of pure reason

  complete everybody may afterwards carry his researches as far as he pleases when he

  has been merely shown what yet remains to be done it is this a duty which must

  reasonably be expected of him who has made it his business to survey the whole field

  in order to consign it to others for future cultivation and allotment and to this

  branch both the scholia belong which will hardly recommend themselves by their dryness

  to amateurs and hence are added here for connoisseurs only 
45  by no means higher

  high towers and metaphysicallygreat men resembling them round

  both of which there is commonly much wind are not for me my place is the fruitful

  bathos the bottomland of experience and the word

  transcendental the meaning of which is so often explained by me but not once grasped

  by my reviewer so carelessly has he regarded everything does not signify something

  passing beyond all experience but something that indeed precedes it a

  priori but that is intended simply to make cognition of experience possible if

  these conceptions overstep experience their employment is termed transcendent a word

  which must be distinguished from transcendental the latter being limited to the

  immanent use that is to experience all misunderstandings of this kind have been

  sufficiently guarded against in the work itself but my reviewer found his advantage in

  misunderstanding me 
46  idealism proper always has a

  mystical tendency and can have no other but mine is solely designed for the purpose

  of comprehending the possibility of our cognition a priori as

  to objects of experience which is a problem never hitherto solved or even suggested

  in this way all mystical idealism falls to the ground for as may be seen already in

  plato it inferred from our cognitions a priori even from

  those of geometry another intuition different from that of the senses namely an

  intellectual intuition because it never occurred to any one that the senses

  themselves might intuite a priori 
47  the reviewer often fights with his

  own shadow when i oppose the truth of experience to dream he never thinks that i am

  here speaking simply of the wellknown somnio objective sumto

  of the wolffian philosophy which is merely formal and with which the distinction

  between sleeping and waking is in no way concerned and in a transcendental philosophy

  indeed can have no place for the rest he calls my deduction of the categories and

  table of the principles of the understanding common wellknown axioms of logic and

  ontology expressed in an idealistic manner the reader need only consult these

  prolegomena upon this point to convince himself that a more

  miserable and historically incorrect judgment could hardly be made

editors introduction
there are not wanting indications that public interest

in the critical philosophy has been quickened

of recent days in these countries as well as in

america to lighten the toil of penetrating through

the wilderness of kants long sentences the english

student has now many aids which those who

began their studies fifteen or twenty years ago did

not enjoy translations paraphrases criticisms

have been published in considerable numbers so

that if it is not yet true that he who runs may

read it may at least be said that a patient student

of ordinary industry and intelligence has his way

made plain before him and yet the very number

of aids is dangerous whatever may be the value

of short and easy handbooks in other departments of

science it is certain that no man will become a

philosopher no man will even acquire a satisfactory

knowledge of the history of philosophy without

personal and prolonged study of the ipsissima verba

of the great masters of human thought above

all said schopenhauer my truthseeking young

friends beware of letting our professors tell youxii

what is contained in the critique of the pure reason

and the advice has not become less wholesome with

the lapse of years the fact however that many

persons have not sufficient familiarity with german

to enable them to study german philosophy in the

original with ease makes translations an educational

necessity and this translation of kants

critique of the faculty of judgement has been undertaken

in the hope that it may promote a more

general study of that masterpiece if any reader

wishes to follow schopenhauers advice he has only

to omit the whole of this prefatory matter and

proceed at once to the authors laborious introduction
it is somewhat surprising that the critique of

judgement has never yet been made accessible to

the english reader dr watson has indeed translated

a few selected passages so also has dr caird

in his valuable account of the kantian philosophy

and i have found their renderings of considerable

service but the space devoted by both writers to

the critique of judgement is very small in comparison

with that given to the critiques of pure and practical

reason and yet the work is not an unimportant

one kant himself regarded it as the copingstone

of his critical edifice it even formed the point of

departure for his successors fichte schelling and

hegel in the construction of their respective

systems possibly the reason of its comparative

neglect lies in its repulsive style kant was never

careful of style and in his later years he becamexiii

more and more enthralled by those technicalities

and refined distinctions which deter so many from

the critical philosophy even in its earlier sections

these symmetrical architectonic amusements as

schopenhauer called them encumber every page of

kants later writings and they are a constant source

of embarrassment to his unhappy translator for

as every translator knows no single word in one

language exactly covers any single word in another

and yet if kants distinctions are to be preserved it

is necessary to select with more or less arbitrariness

english equivalents for german technical terms and

retain them all through instances of this will be

given later on i only remark here on the fact that

kants besetting sin of overtechnicality is especially

conspicuous in this treatise
another faultan old fault of kantapparent

after reading even a few pages is that repetitions

are very frequent of the same thought in but slightly

varied language arguments are repeated over and

over again until they become quite wearisome and

then when the readers attention has flagged and

he is glancing cursorily down the page some important

new point is introduced without emphasis

as if the author were really anxious to keep his

meaning to himself at all hazards a book written

in such fashion rarely attracts a wide circle of

readers and yet not only did goethe think

highly of it but it received a large measure of

attention in france as well as in germany on its

first appearance originally published at berlin inxiv

1790 a second edition was called for in 1793 and

a french translation was made by imhoff in 1796

other french versions are those by keratry and

weyland in 1823 and by barni in 1846 this

last i have had before me while performing my

task but i have not found it of much service the

older french translations i have not seen the

existence of these french versions when taken in

connexion with the absence until very recently of

any systematic account of the critique of judgement

in english may be perhaps explained by the lively

interest that was taken on the continent in the

philosophy of art in the early part of the century

whereas scientific studies on this subject received

little attention in england during the same period
the student of the critique of pure reason will

remember how closely in his transcendental logic

kant follows the lines of the ordinary logic of the

schools he finds his whole plan ready made for

him as it were and he proceeds to work out the

metaphysical principles which underlie the process

of syllogistic reasoning and as there are three

propositions in every syllogism he points out that

in correspondence with this triplicity the higher

faculties of the soul may be regarded as threefold

the understanding or the faculty of concepts

gives us our major premise as it supplies us in

the first instance with a general notion by means

of the judgement we see that a particular case comes

under the general rule and by the reason we draw

our conclusion these as three distinct movementsxv

in the process of reasoning are regarded

by kant as indicating three distinct faculties with

which the analytic of concepts the analytic of

principles and the dialectic are respectively concerned

the full significance of this important

classification does not seem however to have

occurred to kant at the time as we may see from

the order in which he wrote his great books1 the

first problem which arrests the attention of all

modern philosophers is of course the problem of

knowledge its conditions and its proper objects

and in the critique of pure reason this is discussed

and the conclusion is reached that nature as

phenomenon is the only object of which we can

hope to acquire any exact knowledge but it is

apparent that there are other problems which merit

consideration a complete philosophy includes practice

as well as theory it has to do not only with

logic but with life and thus the critique of practical

reason was written in which is unfolded the doctrine

of mans freedom standing in sharp contrast with the

necessity of natural law here then it seems at

first sight as if we had covered the whole field

of human activity for we have investigated the

sources of knowledge and at the same time have

pointed out the conditions of practical life and have

seen that the laws of freedom are just as true in

their own sphere as are the laws of nature
xvi

but as we reflect on our mental states we find

that here no proper account has been given of the

phenomena of feeling which play so large a part

in experience and this kant saw before he had

proceeded very far with the critique of practical

reason and in consequence he adopted a threefold

classification of the higher mental faculties based on

that given by previous psychologists knowledge

feeling desire these are the three ultimate modes

of consciousness of which the second has not yet

been described and when we compare this with

the former triple division which we took up from

the aristotelian logic we see that the parallelism

is significant understanding is par excellence the

faculty of knowledge and reason the faculty of

desire these points are developed in kants

first two critiques and this suggests that the

judgement corresponds to the feeling of pleasure

and pain it occupies a position intermediate between

understanding and reason just as roughly

speaking the feeling of pleasure is intermediate

between our perception of an object and our desire

to possess it
and so the critique of judgement completes the

whole undertaking of criticism its endeavour is to

show that there are a priori principles at the basis

of judgement just as there are in the case of understanding

and of reason that these principles like

the principles of reason are not constitutive but

only regulative of experience ie that they do not

teach us anything positive about the characteristicsxvii

of objects but only indicate the conditions under

which we find it necessary to view them and

lastly that we are thus furnished with an a priori

philosophy of pleasure
the fundamental principle underlying the procedure

of the judgement is seen to be that of the

purposiveness of nature nature is everywhere

adapted to ends or purposes and thus constitutes

a  a wellordered whole by this means

nature is regarded by us as if its particular empirical

laws were not isolated and disparate but connected

and in relation deriving their unity in seeming

diversity from an intelligence which is at the source

of nature it is only by the assumption of such a

principle that we can construe nature to ourselves

and the principle is then said to be a transcendental

condition of the exercise of our judging faculty but

valid only for the reflective not for the determinant

judgement it gives us pleasure to view nature in

this way just as the contemplation of chaos would

be painful
but this purposiveness may be only formal and

subjective or real and objective in some cases

the purposiveness resides in the felt harmony and

accordance of the form of the object with the cognitive

faculties in others the form of the object is

judged to harmonise with the purpose in view in its

existence that is to say in the one case we judge

the form of the object to be purposive as in the

case of a flower but could not explain any purpose

served by it in the other case we have a definitexviii

notion of what it is adapted for in the former case

the aesthetical judgement is brought to bear in the

latter the teleological and it thus appears that the

critique of judgement has two main divisions it

treats first of the philosophy of taste the beautiful

and the sublime in nature and secondly of the

teleology of natures working it is a curious

literary parallel that st augustine hints confessions

iv 15 that he had written a book de pulchro

et pto in which these apparently distinct topics

were combined pulchrum esse quod per se

ipsum aptum autem quod ad aliquid accommodatum

deceret a beautiful object has no

purpose external to itself and the observer but a

useful object serves further ends both however

may be brought under the higher category of things

that are reckoned purposive by the judgement
we have here then in the first place a basis for

an a priori philosophy of taste and kant works

out its details with great elaboration he borrowed

little from the writings of his predecessors but

struck out as was ever his plan a line of his own

he quotes with approval from burkes treatise on

the sublime and beautiful which was accessible to

him in a german translation but is careful to

remark that it is as psychology not as philosophy

that burkes work has value he may have read

in addition hutchesons inquiry which had also

been translated into german and he was complete

master of humes opinions of other writers on

beauty he only names batteux and lessingxix

batteux was a french writer of repute who had

attempted a twofold arrangement of the arts as

they may be brought under space and under time

respectively a mode of classification which would

naturally appeal to kant he does not seem

however to have read the ancient textbook

on the subject aristotles poetics the principles

of which lessing declared to be as certain as

euclid
following the guiding thread of the categories he

declares that the aesthetical judgement about beauty

is according to quality disinterested a point which

had been laid down by such different writers

as hutcheson and moses mendelssohn as to

quantity the judgement about beauty gives universal

satisfaction although it is based on no definite

concept the universality is only subjective but

still it is there the maxim trahit sua quemque

voluptas does not apply to the pleasure afforded by

a pure judgement about beauty as to relation the

characteristic of the object called beautiful is that it

betrays a purposiveness without definite purpose

the pleasure is a priori independent on the one

hand of the charms of sense or the emotions of mere

feeling as winckelmann had already declared and

on the other hand is a pleasure quite distinct from

that taken which we feel when viewing perfection

with which wolff and baumgarten had identified it

by his distinction between free and dependent

beauty which we also find in the pages of hutcheson

kant further develops his doctrine of thexx

freedom of the pure judgement of taste from the

thraldom of concepts
finally the satisfaction afforded by the contemplation

of a beautiful object is a necessary satisfaction

this necessity is not to be sure theoretical like the

necessity attaching to the law of causality nor is it a

practical necessity as is the need to assume the moral

law as the guiding principle of conduct but it may

be called exemplary that is we may set up our satisfaction

in a beautiful picture as setting an example

to be followed by others it is plain however that

this can only be assumed under certain presuppositions

we must presuppose the idea of a sensus communis

or common sense in which all men share as

knowledge admits of being communicated to others

so also does the feeling for beauty for the relation

between the cognitive faculties requisite for taste

is also requisite for intelligence or sound understanding

and as we always presuppose the latter to

be the same in others as in ourselves so may we

presuppose the former
the analysis of the sublime which follows that

of the beautiful is interesting and profound indeed

schopenhauer regarded it as the best part of the

critique of the aesthetical judgement the general

characteristics of our judgements about the sublime

are similar to those already laid down in the case

of the beautiful but there are marked differences

in the two cases if the pleasure taken in beauty

arises from a feeling of the purposiveness of the

object in its relation to the subject that in sublimityxxi

rather expresses a purposiveness of the subject in

respect of the object nothing in nature is sublime

and the sublimity really resides in the mind

and there alone indeed as true beauty is found

properly speaking only in beauty of form the idea

of sublimity is excited rather by those objects which

are formless and exhibit a violation of purpose
a distinction not needed in the case of the

beautiful becomes necessary when we proceed to

further analyse the sublime for in aesthetical

judgements about the beautiful the mind is in restful

contemplation but in the case of the sublime a

mental movement is excited pp 105 and 120 this

movement as it is pleasing must involve a purposiveness

in the harmony of the mental powers and the

purposiveness may be either in reference to the faculty

of cognition or to that of desire in the former case

the sublime is called the mathematically sublimethe

sublime of mere magnitudethe absolutely great in

the latter it is the sublime of power the dynamically

sublime gioberti an italian writer on the philosophy

of taste has pushed this distinction so far as

to find in it an explanation of the relation between

beauty and sublimity the dynamical sublime

he says creates the beautiful the mathematical

sublime contains it a remark with which probably

kant would have no quarrel
in both cases however we find that the feeling

of the sublime awakens in us a feeling of

the supersensible destination of man the very

capacity of conceiving the sublime he tells usxxii

indicates a mental faculty that far surpasses

every standard of sense and to explain the

necessity belonging to our judgements about the

sublime kant points out that as we find ourselves

compelled to postulate a sensus communis to account

for the agreement of men in their appreciation of

beautiful objects so the principle underlying their

consent in judging of the sublime is the presupposition

of the moral feeling in man the feeling

of the sublimity of our own moral destination is the

necessary prerequisite for forming such judgements

the connexion between beauty and goodness involved

to a greek in the double sense of the word

 is developed by kant with keen insight to

feel interest in the beauty of nature he regards

as a mark of a moral disposition though he will not

admit that the same inference may be drawn as

to the character of the art connoisseur  42 but

it is specially with reference to the connexion between

the capacity for appreciating the sublime and

the moral feeling that the originality of kants treatment

becomes apparent
the objects of nature he continues which we

call sublime inspire us with a feeling of pain rather

than of pleasure as lucretius has it


me quaedam divina voluptas
percipit atque horror


but this horror must not inspire actual fear

as no extraneous charm must mingle with the

satisfaction felt in a beautiful object if the judgementxxiii

about beauty is to remain pure so in the

case of the sublime we must not be afraid of the

object which yet in certain aspects is fearful
this conception of the feelings of sublimity

excited by the loneliness of an alpine peak or the

grandeur of an earthquake is now a familiar one

but it was not so in kants day switzerland had

not then become the recreationground of europe

and though natural beauty was a familiar topic with

poets and painters it was not generally recognised

that taste has also to do with the sublime de

saussures travels hallers poem die alpen and

this work of kants mark the beginning of a new

epoch in our ways of looking at the sublime and

terrible aspects of nature and it is not a little

remarkable that the man who could write thus

feelingly about the emotions inspired by grand and

savage scenery had never seen a mountain in

his life the power and the insight of his

observations here are in marked contrast to the

poverty of some of his remarks about the characteristics

of beauty for instance he puts forward the

curious doctrine that colour in a picture is only an

extraneous charm and does not really add to the

beauty of the form delineated nay rather distracts

the mind from it his criticisms on this point if

sound would make flaxman a truer artist than

titian or paolo veronese but indeed his discussion

of painting or music is not very appreciative he

was to the end a creature of pure reason
upon the analysis he gives of the arts littlexxiv

need be said here fine art is regarded as the

art of genius that innate mental disposition

through which nature gives the rule to art  46

art differs from science in the absence of definite

concepts in the mind of the artist it thus happens

that the great artist can rarely communicate his

methods indeed he cannot explain them even to

himself poeta nascitur non fit and the same is

true in every form of fine art genius is in short

the faculty of presenting aesthetical ideas an

aesthetical idea being an intuition of the imagination

to which no concept is adequate and it

is by the excitation of such ineffable ideas that a

great work of art affects us as bacon tells us

that is the best part of beauty which a picture

cannot express no nor the first sight of the eye

this characteristic of the artistic genius has been

noted by all who have thought upon art more is

present in its productions than can be perfectly

expressed in language as pliny said of timanthus

the painter of iphigenia in omnibus ejus operibus

intelligitur plus super quam pingitur but this

genius requires to be kept in check by taste quite

in the spirit of the  of the best greek art

kant remarks that if in a work of art some feature

must be sacrificed it is better to lose something of

genius than to violate the canons of taste it is in

this selfmastery that the sanity of true genius

expresses itself
the main question with which the critique of

judgement is concerned is of course the question asxxv

to the purposiveness the zweckmssigkeit exhibited

by nature that nature appears to be full of

purpose is mere matter of fact it displays purposiveness

in respect of our faculties of cognition

in those of its phenomena which we designate

beautiful and also in its organic products we

observe methods of operation which we can only

explain by describing them as processes in which

means are used to accomplish certain ends as

processes that are purposive in our observation

of natural phenomena as kuno fischer puts it we

judge their forms aesthetically and their life teleologically
as regards the first kind of zweckmssigkeit

that which is ohne zweckthe purposiveness of a

beautiful object which does not seem to be directed

to any external endthere are two ways in which we

may account for it we may either say that it was

actually designed to be beautiful by the supreme

force behind nature or we may say that purposiveness

is not really resident in nature but that our

perception of it is due to the subjective needs of our

judging faculty we have to contemplate beautiful

objects as if they were purposive but they may not

be so in reality and this latter idealistic doctrine is

what kant falls back upon he appeals in support

of it to the phenomena of crystallisation pp 243

sqq in which many very beautiful forms seem

to be produced by merely mechanical processes

the beauty of a rock crystal is apparently produced

without any forethought on the part of nature andxxvi

he urges that we are not justified in asserting

dogmatically that any laws distinct from those of

mechanism are needed to account for beauty in

other cases mechanism can do so much may it

not do all and he brings forward as a consideration

which ought to settle the question the fact that

in judging of beauty we invariably seek its gauge

in ourselves a priori we do not learn from nature

but from ourselves what we are to find beautiful

mr kennedy in his donnellan lectures has here

pointed out several weak spots in kants armour in

the first place the fact that we seek the gauge of

beauty in our own mind may be shown from his

own definition to be a necessary result of the very

nature of beauty2 for kant tells us that the

aesthetical judgement about beauty always involves

a reference of the representation to the subject

and this applies equally to judgements about the

beautiful in art and the beautiful in nature but

no one could maintain that from this definition it

follows that we are not compelled to postulate design

in the mind of the artist who paints a beautiful

picture and thus as the fact that we always seek

the gauge of beauty in ourselves does not do away

with the belief in a designing mind when we are

contemplating works of art it cannot be said to

exclude the belief in a master hand which moulded

the forms of nature as cicero has it nature is

non artificiosa solum sed plane artifex but the

cogency of this reasoning for the details of whichxxvii

i must refer the reader to mr kennedys pages

becomes more apparent when we reflect on that

second form of purposiveness viz adaptation to

definite ends with which we meet in the phenomena

of organic life
if we watch eg the growth of a tree we perceive

that its various parts are not isolated and

unconnected but that on the contrary they are only

possible by reference to the idea of the whole each

limb affects every other and is reciprocally affected by

it in short in such a product of nature every part not

only exists by means of the other parts but is thought

as existing for the sake of the others and the whole

p 277 the operations of nature in organised

bodies seem to be of an entirely different character

from mere mechanical processes we cannot construe

them to ourselves except under the hypothesis that

nature in them is working towards a designed end

the distinction between natures technic or

purposive operation and natures mechanism is

fundamental for the explanation of natural law

the language of biology eloquently shows the

impossibility of eliminating at least the idea of

purpose from our investigations into the phenomena

of life growth and reproduction and kant dismisses

with scant respect that cheap and easy

philosophy which would fain deny the distinctiveness

of natures purposive operation a doctrine

like that of epicurus in which every natural phenomenon

is regarded as the result of the blind drifting

of atoms in accordance with purely mechanical lawsxxviii

really explains nothing and least of all explains

that illusion in our teleological judgements which

leads us to assume purpose where really there is

none
it has been urged by kirchmann and others that

this distinction between technic and mechanism

on which kant lays so much stress has been disproved

by the progress of modern science the

doctrines usually associated with the name of

darwin of natural selection and survival of the

fittest quite sufficiently explain it is said on

mechanical principles the semblance of purpose with

which nature mocks us the presence of order is

not due to any purpose behind the natural operation

but to the inevitable disappearance of the disorderly

it would be absurd of course to claim for kant

that he anticipated the darwinian doctrines of

development and yet passages are not wanting in

his writings in which he takes a view of the continuity

of species with which modern science would

have little fault to find nature organises itself

and its organised products in every species no

doubt after one general pattern but yet with suitable

deviations which selfpreservation demands according

to circumstances p 279 the analogy of

forms which with all their differences seem to have

been produced according to a common original type

strengthens our suspicions of an actual relationship

between them in their production from a common

parent through the gradual approximation of one

animal genus to anotherfrom those in which thexxix

principle of purposes seems to be best authenticated

ie from man down to the polype and again from

this down to mosses and lichens and finally to crude

matter and so the whole technic of nature which

is so incomprehensible to us in organised beings

that we believe ourselves compelled to think a

different principle for it seems to be derived from

matter and its powers according to mechanical laws

like those by which it works in the formation of

crystals p 337 such a theory he calls a daring

venture of reason and its coincidences with modern

science are real and striking but he is careful to

add that such a theory even if established would

not eliminate purpose from the universe it would

indeed suggest that certain special processes having

the semblance of purpose may be elucidated on

mechanical principles but on the whole purposive

operation on the part of mother nature it would

still be needful to assume p 338 no finite

reason can hope to understand the production of

even a blade of grass by mere mechanical causes

p 326 it is absurd to hope that another newton

will arise in the future who shall make comprehensible

by us the production of a blade of grass

according to natural laws which no design has

ordered p 312
crude materialism thus affording no explanation

of the purposiveness in nature we go on to ask

what other theories are logically possible we may

dismiss at once the doctrine of hylozoism according

to which the purposes in nature are explainedxxx

in reference to a worldsoul which is the inner

principle of the material universe and constitutes its

life for such a doctrine is selfcontradictory inasmuch

as lifelessness inertia is the essential characteristic

of matter and to talk of living matter is

absurd p 304 a much more plausible system is

that of spinoza who aimed at establishing the ideality

of the principle of natural purposes he regarded

the world whole as a complex of manifold determinations

inhering in a single simple substance and

thus reduced our concepts of the purposive in nature

to our own consciousness of existing in an allembracing

being but on reflection we see that this

does not so much explain as explain away the purposiveness

of nature it gives us an unity of inherence

in one substance but not an unity of causal

dependence on one substance p 303 and this

latter would be necessary in order to explain the

unity of purpose which nature exhibits in its phenomenal

working spinozism therefore does not give

what it pretends to give it puts us off with a vague

and unfruitful unity of ground when what we seek

is a unity that shall itself contain the causes of the

differences manifest in nature
we have left then as the only remaining possible

doctrine theism which represents natural purposes

as produced in accordance with the will and design

of an intelligent author and governor of nature

this theory is in the first place superior to all

other grounds of explanation p 305 for it gives

a full solution of the problem before us and enablesxxxi

us to maintain the reality of the zweckmssigkeit of

nature teleology finds the consummation of its

investigations only in theology p 311 to represent

the world and the natural purposes therein

as produced by an intelligent cause is completely

satisfactory from every human point of view for

both the speculative and practical use of our reason

p 312 thus the contemplation of natural purposes

ie the common argument from design

enables us to reach a highest understanding as

cause of the world in accordance with the principles

of the reflective judgement ie in accordance with the

constitution of our human faculty of cognition p

416
it is in this qualifying clause that kants negative

attitude in respect of theism betrays itself

he regards it as a necessary assumption for the

guidance of scientific investigation no less than for

the practical needs of morals but he does not

admit that we can claim for it objective validity

in the language of the critique of pure reason the

idea of god furnishes a regulative not a constitutive

principle of reason or as he prefers to put it in the

present work it is valid only for the reflective not

for the determinant judgement we are not justified

kant maintains in asserting dogmatically that god

exists there is only permitted to us the limited

formula we cannot otherwise conceive the purposiveness

which must lie at the basis of our cognition

of the internal possibility of many natural things

than by representing it and the world in general asxxxii

produced by an intelligent cause ie a god p

312
we ask then whence arises this impossibility of

objective statement it is in the true kantian

spirit to assert that no synthetical proposition can

be made with reference to what lies above and

behind the world of sense but there is a difficulty

in carrying out this principle into details kants

refusal to infer a designing hand behind the apparent

order of nature is based he tells us on the fact

that the concept of a natural purpose is one that

cannot be justified to the speculative reason for

all we know it may only indicate our way of looking

at things and may point to no corresponding objective

reality that we are forced by the limited

nature of our faculties to view nature as working

towards ends as purposive does not prove that it is

really so we cannot justify such pretended insight

into what is behind the veil
it is to be observed however that precisely

similar arguments might be urged against our

affirmation of purpose design will as the spring of

the actions of other human beings3 for let us

consider why it is that mind being assumed as the

basis of our own individual consciousness we go on

to attribute minds of like character to other men

we see that the external behaviour of other men is

similar to our own and that the most reasonable

way of accounting for such behaviour is to supposexxxiii

that they have minds like ourselves that they are

possessed of an active and spontaneously energising

faculty which is the seat of their personality but

it is instructive to observe that neither on kantian

principles nor on any other can we demonstrate

this to cross the chasm which separates one mans

personality from anothers requires a venture of

faith just as emphatically as any theological formula

i can by no means prove to the determinant judgement

that the complex of sensations which i constantly

experience and which i call the prime

minister is anything more than a wellordered

machine it is improbable that this is the casehighly

improbable but the falsity of such an hypothesis

cannot be proved in the same way that we

would prove the falsity of the assertion that two

and two make five but then though the hypothesis

cannot be thus ruled out of court by demonstration

of its absurdity it is not the simplest

hypothesis nor is it that one which best accounts

for the facts the assumption on the other hand

that the men whom i meet every day have minds

like my own perfectly accounts for all the facts and

is a very simple assumption it merely extends by

induction the sphere of a force which i already know

to exist or in other words crude materialism not

giving me an intelligent account of my own individual

consciousness i recognise mind  as a vera

causa as something which really does produce effects

in the field of experience and which therefore i may

legitimately put forward as the cause of those actionsxxxiv

of other men which externally so much resemble my

own but as has been said before this argument

though entirely convincing to any sane person is not

demonstrative in kantian language and on kantian

principles the reasoning here used would seem to be

valid only for the reflective and not for the determinant

judgement if the principle of design or

conscious adaptation of means to ends be not a

constitutive principle of experience but only a

regulative principle introduced to account for the

facts what right have we to put it forward dogmatically

as affording an explanation of the actions

of other human beings
it cannot be said that kants attempted answer

to such a defence of the design argument is quite

conclusive in  90 of the methodology p 399 he

pleads that though it is perfectly legitimate to argue

by analogy from our own minds to the minds of

other mennay further although we may conclude

from those actions of the lower animals which

display plan that they are not as descartes alleged

mere machinesyet it is not legitimate to conclude

from the apparent presence of design in the operations

of nature that a conscious mind directs those

operations for he argues that in comparing the

actions of men and the lower animals or in comparing

the actions of one man with those of another we are

not pressing our analogy beyond the limits of experience

men and beasts alike are finite living beings

subject to the limitations of finite existence and

hence the law which governs the one series ofxxxv

operations may be regarded by analogy as sufficiently

explaining the other series but the power

at the basis of nature is utterly above definition

or comprehension and we are going beyond our

legitimate province if we venture to ascribe to it a

mode of operation with which we are only conversant

in the case of beings subject to the conditions of

space and time he urges in short that when

speaking about man and his mind we thoroughly

understand what we are talking about but in

speaking of the mind of deity we are dealing with

something of which we have no experience and of

which therefore we have no right to predicate anything
but it is apparent that as has been pointed out

even when we infer the existence of another finite

mind from certain observed operations we are

making an inference about something which is as

mysterious an x as anything can be mind is not a

thing that is subject to the laws and conditions of

the world of sense it is in the world but not of

the world and so to infer the existence of the

mind of any individual except myself is a quite

different kind of inference from that by which for

example we infer the presence of an electromagnet

in a given field the action of the latter we understand

to a large extent but we do not understand

the action of mind which yet we know from daily

experience of ourselves does produce effects in the

phenomenal world often permanent and important

effects briefly the action of mind upon matterxxxvi

to use the ordinary phraseology for the sake of

clearness iswe may assume for our present purposean

established fact hence the causality of

mind is a vera causa we bring it in to account for

the actions of other human beings and by precisely

the same process of reasoning we invoke it to

explain the operations of nature
and it is altogether beside the point to urge as

kant does incessantly that in the latter case the intelligence

inferred is infinite in the former only finite

all that the design argument undertakes to prove

is that mind lies at the basis of nature it is quite

beyond its province to say whether this mind is

finite or infinite and thus kants criticisms on

p 364 are somewhat wide of the mark there is

always a difficulty in any argument which tries to

establish the operation of mind anywhere for mind

cannot be seen or touched or felt but the difficulty

is not peculiar to that particular form of argument

with which theological interests are involved
the real plausibility of this objection arises from

a vague idea often present to us when we speak of

infinite wisdom or infinite intelligence namely that

the epithet infinite in some way alters the meaning

of the attributes to which it is applied but the

truth is that the word infinite when applied to

wisdom or knowledge or any other intellectual or

moral quality can only properly have reference to

the number of acts of wisdom or knowledge that we

suppose to have been performed the only sense

in which we have any right to speak of infinitexxxvii

wisdom is that it is that which performs an infinite

number of wise acts and so when we speak of

infinite intelligence we have not the slightest warrant

either in logic or in common sense for supposing

that such intelligence is not similar in kind to that

finite intelligence which we know in man
to understand kants attitude fully we must

also take into consideration the great weight that

he attaches to the moral argument for the existence

of god the positive side of his teaching

on theism is summed up in the following

sentence p 388 for the theoretical reflective

judgement physical teleology sufficiently proves

from the purposes of nature an intelligent worldcause

for the practical judgement moral teleology

establishes it by the concept of a final purpose

which it is forced to ascribe to creation that

side of his system which is akin to agnosticism

finds expression in his determined refusal to admit

anything more than this the existence of god is

for him a thing of faith and is not a fact of knowledge

strictly so called faith he holds p 409

is the moral attitude of reason as to belief in

that which is unattainable by theoretical cognition

it is therefore the constant principle of the mind

to assume as true that which it is necessary to presuppose

as condition of the possibility of the highest

moral final purpose as he says elsewhere introduction

to logic ix p 60 that man is morally

unbelieving who does not accept that which though

impossible to know is morally necessary to supposexxxviii

and as far as he goes a theist may agree with

him and he has done yeomans service to theism

by his insistence on the absolute impossibility of any

other working hypothesis as an explanation of the

phenomena of nature but i have endeavoured to

indicate at what points he does not seem to me to

have gone as far as even his own declared principles

would justify him in going if the existence of a

supreme mind be a thing of faith this may with

equal justice be said of the finite minds of the men

all around us and his attempt to show that the

argument from analogy is here without foundation is

not convincing
kant however in the critique of judgement is

sadly fettered by the chains that he himself had

forged and frequently chafes under the restraints

they impose he indicates more than once a point of

view higher than that of the critique of pure reason

from which the phenomena of life and mind may be

contemplated he had already hinted in that work

that the supersensible substrate of the ego and the

nonego might be identical both kinds of objects

differ from each other not internally but only so far

as the one appears external to the other possibly

what is at the basis of phenomenal matter as a thing

in itself may not be so heterogeneous after all as we

imagine4 this hypothesis which remains a bare

undeveloped possibility in the earlier work is put

forward as a positive doctrine in the critique of judgement

there must says kant be a groundxxxix

of the unity of the supersensible which lies at the

basis of nature with that which the concept of

freedom practically contains introduction p 13

that is to say he maintains that to explain the

phenomena of organic life and the purposiveness of

nature we must hold that the world of sense is not

disparate from and opposed to the world of thought

but that nature is the development of freedom the

connexion of nature and freedom is suggested by

nay is involved in the notion of natural adaptation

and although we can arrive at no knowledge of the

supersensible substrate of both yet such a common

ground there must be this principle is the startingpoint

of the systems which followed that of kant

and the philosophy of later idealism is little more

than a development of the principle in its consequences
he approaches the same doctrine by a different

path in the critique of the teleological judgement

 77 where he argues that the distinction between

the mechanical and the teleological working of

nature upon which so much stress has been justly

laid depends for its validity upon the peculiar character

of our understanding when we give what

may be called a mechanical elucidation of any

natural phenomenon we begin with its parts and

from what we know of them we explain the whole

but in the case of certain objects eg organised

bodies this cannot be done in their case we can

only account for the parts by a reference to the

whole now were it possible for us to perceive axl

whole before its parts and derive the latter from the

former5 then an organism would be capable of being

understood and would be an object of knowledge in

the strictest sense but our understanding is not

able to do this and its inadequacy for such a task

leads us to conceive the possibility of an understanding

not discursive like ours but intuitive for

which knowledge of the whole would precede that

of the parts it is at least possible to consider the

material world as mere phenomenon and to think

as its substrate something like a thing in itself

which is not phenomenon and to attach to this

a corresponding intellectual intuition thus there

would be although incognisable by us a supersensible

real ground for nature to which we ourselves belong

p 325 hence although mechanism and

technic must not be confused and must ever stand

side by side in our scientific investigation of natural

law yet must they be regarded as coalescing in a

single higher principle incognisable by us the

ground of union is the supersensible substrate of

nature of which we can determine nothing positively

except that it is the being in itself of which we

merely know the phenomenon thus then it

appears that the whole force of kants main argument

has proceeded upon an assumption viz the

permanent opposition between sense and understanding

which the progress of the argument has

shown to be unsound kant seems says goethe6xli

to have woven a certain element of irony into his

method for while at one time he seemed to be

bent on limiting our faculties of knowledge in the

narrowest way at another time he pointed as it

were with a side gesture beyond the limits which

he himself had drawn the fact of adaptation of

means to ends observable in nature seems to break

down the barrier between nature and freedom

and if we once relinquish the distinction between

mechanism and technic in the operations of nature

we are led to the idea of an absolute being who

manifests himself by action which though necessary

is yet the outcome of perfect freedom
kant however though he approaches such a

position more than once can never be said to have

risen to it he deprecates unceasingly the attempt

to combine principles of nature with the principles

of freedom as a task beyond the modest capacity of

human reason and while strenuously insisting on

the practical force of the moral argument for the

being of god which is found in the witness of

mans conscience will not admit that it can in any

way be regarded as strengthening the theoretical

arguments adduced by teleology the two

lines of proof he holds are quite distinct and

nothing but confusion and intellectual disaster can

result from the effort to combine them the moral

proof stands by itself and it needs no such crutches

as the argument from design can offer but asxlii

mr kennedy has pointed out in his acute criticism7

of the kantian doctrine of theism it would not be

possible to combine a theoretical disbelief in god

with a frank acceptance of the practical belief of

his existence borne in upon us by the moral law

kant himself admits this a dogmatical unbelief

he says p 411 cannot subsist together with a

moral maxim dominant in the mental attitude

that is though the theoretical argument be incomplete

we cannot reject the conclusion to which it

leads for this is confirmed by the moral necessities

of conscience
kants position then seems to come to this

that though he never doubts the existence of

god he has very grave doubts that he can be

theoretically known by man that he is is certain

what he is we cannot determine it is a position

not dissimilar to current agnostic doctrines and as

long as the antithesis between sense and understanding

between matter and mind is insisted

upon as expressing a real and abiding truth kants

reasoning can hardly be refuted with completeness

no doubt it may be urged that since the practical

and theoretical arguments both arrive at the same

conclusion the cogency of our reasoning in the

latter should confirm our trust in the former but

true conclusions may sometimes seem to follow

from quite insufficient premises and kant is thus

justified in demanding that each argument shall

be submitted to independent tests i have endeavouredxliii

to show above that he has not treated

the theoretical line of reasoning quite fairly and that

he has underestimated its force but its value as an

argument is not increased by showing that another

entirely different process of thought leads to the

same result and that the witness of conscience

affords the most powerful and convincing argument

for the existence of a supreme being the source of

law as of love is a simple matter of experience

induction syllogism analogy do not really generate

belief in god though they may serve to justify to

reason a faith that we already possess the poet

has the truth of it


wer gott nicht fhlt in sich und allen lebenskreisen
dem werdet ihr ihn nicht beweisen mit beweisen


    
i give at the end of this introduction a glossary

of the chief philosophical terms used by kant i

have tried to render them by the same english

equivalents all through the work in order to preserve

as far as may be the exactness of expression

in the original i am conscious that this makes the

translation clumsy in many places but have thought

it best to sacrifice elegance to precision this

course is the more necessary to adopt as kant

cannot be understood unless his nice verbal distinctions

be attended to thus real means quite a

different thing from wirklich hang from neigung

rhrung from affekt or leidenschaft anschauung

from empfindung or wahrnehmung endzweck fromxliv
letzter zweck idee from vorstellung eigenschaft

from attribut or beschaffenheit schranke from

grenze berreden from berzeugen etc i am not

satisfied with gratification and grief as the

english equivalents for vergngen and schmerz but

it is necessary to distinguish these words from lust

and unlust and mental pleasure mental pain

which would nearly hit the sense are awkward

again the constant rendering of schn by beautiful

involves the expression beautiful art instead of the

more usual phrase fine art purposive is an ugly

word but it has come into use lately and its employment

enables us to preserve the connexion between

zweck and zweckmssig i have printed judgement

with a capital letter when it signifies the faculty

with a small initial when it signifies the act of

judging and in like manner i distinguish objekt

from gegenstand by printing the word object

when it represents the former with a large initial
the text i have followed is in the main that

printed by hartenstein but occasionally rosenkranz

preserves the better reading all important variants

between the first and second editions have been

indicated at the foot of the page a few notes have

been added which are enclosed in square brackets

to distinguish them from those which formed part of

the original work i have in general quoted kants

introduction to logic and critique of practical reason

in dr abbotts translations
my best thanks are due to rev j h kennedy

and mr f purser for much valuable aid duringxlv

the passage of this translation through the press

and i am under even greater obligations to mr

mahaffy who was good enough to read through

the whole of the proof by his acute and learned

criticisms many errors have been avoided others

i have no doubt still remain but for these i must

be accounted alone responsible

more than twentyone years have passed since

the first edition of this translation was published

and during that time much has been written both

in germany and in england on the subject of

kants critique of judgement in particular the

german text has been critically determined by the

labours of professor windelband whose fine edition

forms the fifth volume of kants collected works as

issued by the royal prussian academy of sciences

berlin 1908 it will be indispensable to future

students an excellent account of the significance

in the kantian system of the urtheilskraft by mr

r a c macmillan appeared in 1912 and mr

j c meredith has published recently an english

edition of the critique of aesthetical judgement with

notes and essays dealing with the philosophy of art

which goes over the ground very fully
some critics of my first edition took exception toxlvi

the clumsiness of the word representation as the

equivalent of vorstellung but i have made no

change in this respect as it seems to me and so far

as i have observed to others who have worked on

the critique of judgement that it is necessary to

preserve in english the relation between the noun

vorstellung and the verb vorstellen if kants reasoning

is to be exhibited clearly i have however

abandoned the attempt to preserve the word kritik

in english and have replaced it by critique or

criticism throughout the other changes that have

been made are mere corrections or emendations of

faulty or obscure renderings with a few additional

notes i have left my original introduction as it

was written in 1892 without attempting any fresh

examination of the problems that kant set himself

preface
we may call the faculty of cognition from principles

a priori pure reason and the inquiry into its

possibility and bounds generally the critique of pure

reason although by this faculty we only understand

reason in its theoretical employment as it appears

under that name in the former work without wishing

to inquire into its faculty as practical reason

according to its special principles that critique

goes merely into our faculty of knowing things a

priori and busies itself therefore only with the

cognitive faculty to the exclusion of the feeling of

pleasure and pain and the faculty of desire and of

the cognitive faculties it only concerns itself with

understanding according to its principles a priori

to the exclusion of judgement and reason as faculties

alike belonging to theoretical cognition because it

is found in the sequel that no other cognitive faculty

but the understanding can furnish constitutive principles

of cognition a priori the critique then

which sifts them all as regards the share which

each of the other faculties might pretend to have

in the clear possession of knowledge from its own

peculiar root leaves nothing but what the understanding

prescribes a priori as law for nature as

the complex of phenomena whose form also is2

given a priori it relegates all other pure concepts

under ideas which are transcendent for our

theoretical faculty of cognition but are not therefore

useless or to be dispensed with for they

serve as regulative principles partly to check the

dangerous pretensions of understanding as if

because it can furnish a priori the conditions of

the possibility of all things which it can know it

had thereby confined within these bounds the possibility

of all things in general and partly to lead it to

the consideration of nature according to a principle

of completeness although it can never attain to

this and thus to further the final design of all

knowledge
it was then properly the understanding which

has its special realm in the cognitive faculty so

far as it contains constitutive principles of cognition

a priori which by the critique comprehensively

called the critique of pure reason was to be placed

in certain and sole possession8 against all other competitors

and so also to reason which contains

constitutive principles a priori nowhere except

simply in respect of the faculty of desire should

be assigned its place in the critique of practical

reason
whether now the judgement which in the order

of our cognitive faculties forms a mediating link

between understanding and reason has also

principles a priori for itself whether these are

constitutive or merely regulative thus indicating

no special realm and whether they give a rule a

priori to the feeling of pleasure and pain as the

mediating link between the cognitive faculty and

the faculty of desire just as the understanding3

prescribes laws a priori to the first reason to the

second these are the questions with which the

present critique of judgement is concerned
a critique of pure reason ie of our faculty of

judging a priori according to principles would be

incomplete if the judgement which as a cognitive

faculty also makes claim to such principles were

not treated as a particular part of it although its

principles in a system of pure philosophy need

form no particular part between the theoretical

and the practical but can be annexed when needful

to one or both as occasion requires for if such

a system is one day to be completed under the

general name of metaphysic which it is possible

to achieve quite completely and which is supremely

important for the use of reason in every reference

the soil for the edifice must be explored

by criticism as deep down as the foundation of

the faculty of principles independent of experience

in order that it may sink in no part for this

would inevitably bring about the downfall of the

whole
we can easily infer from the nature of the

judgement whose right use is so necessarily and

so universally requisite that by the name of sound

understanding nothing else but this faculty is

meant that it must be attended with great difficulties

to find a principle peculiar to it some such

it must contain a priori in itself for otherwise it

would not be set apart by the commonest criticism

as a special cognitive faculty this principle must

not be derived a priori from concepts for these

belong to the understanding and judgement is only

concerned with their application it must therefore

furnish of itself a concept through which properly4

speaking no thing is cognised but which only serves

as a rule though not an objective one to which it

can adapt its judgement because for this latter

another faculty of judgement would be requisite

in order to be able to distinguish whether any

given case is or is not the case for the rule
this perplexity about a principle whether it is

subjective or objective presents itself mainly in

those judgements that we call aesthetical which

concern the beautiful and the sublime of nature or

of art and nevertheless the critical investigation

of a principle of judgement in these is the most

important part in a critique of this faculty for

although they do not by themselves contribute to

the knowledge of things yet they belong to the

cognitive faculty alone and point to an immediate

reference of this faculty to the feeling of pleasure or

pain according to some principle a priori without

confusing this with what may be the determining

ground of the faculty of desire which has its principles

a priori in concepts of reasonin the

logical judging of nature experience exhibits a

conformity to law in things to the understanding

or to the explanation of which the general concept

of the sensible does not attain here the judgement

can only derive from itself a principle of the

reference of the natural thing to the unknowable

supersensible a principle which it must only use

from its own point of view for the cognition of

nature and so though in this case such a

principle a priori can and must be applied to the

cognition of the beings of the world and opens out

at the same time prospects which are advantageous

for the practical reason yet it has no immediate

reference to the feeling of pleasure and pain but5

this reference is precisely the puzzle in the principle

of judgement which renders a special section for

this faculty necessary in the critique since the

logical judging according to concepts from which

an immediate inference can never be drawn to

the feeling of pleasure and pain along with their

critical limitation has at all events been capable

of being appended to the theoretical part of

philosophy
the examination of the faculty of taste as the

aesthetical judgement is not here planned in reference

to the formation or the culture of taste for this will

take its course in the future as in the past without

any such investigations but merely in a transcendental

point of view hence i trust that as

regards the deficiency of the former purpose it will

be judged with indulgence though in the latter

point of view it must be prepared for the severest

scrutiny but i hope that the great difficulty of

solving a problem so involved by nature may serve

as excuse for some hardly avoidable obscurity in

its solution if only it be clearly established that

the principle is correctly stated i grant that the

mode of deriving the phenomena of the judgement

from it has not all the clearness which might

be rightly demanded elsewhere viz in the case

of cognition according to concepts but i believe

that i have attained to it in the second part of

this work
here then i end my whole critical undertaking

i shall proceed without delay to the doctrinal part

in order to profit as far as is possible by the more

favourable moments of my increasing years it is

obvious that in this part there will be no special

section for the judgement because in respect of this6

faculty criticism serves instead of theory but

according to the division of philosophy and also of

pure philosophy into theoretical and practical the

metaphysic of nature and of morals will complete

the undertaking

7

introduction
i of the division of philosophy
we proceed quite correctly if as usual we divide

philosophy as containing the principles of the

rational cognition of things by means of concepts

not merely as logic does principles of the form of

thought in general without distinction of objects

into theoretical and practical but then the concepts

which furnish their object to the principles of this

rational cognition must be specifically distinct

otherwise they would not justify a division which

always presupposes a contrast between the principles

of the rational cognition belonging to the different

parts of a science
now there are only two kinds of concepts and

these admit as many distinct principles of the

possibility of their objects viz natural concepts

and the concept of freedom the former render

possible theoretical cognition according to principles

a priori the latter in respect of this theoretical

cognition only supplies in itself a negative principle

that of mere contrast but on the other hand it

furnishes fundamental propositions which extend

the sphere of the determination of the will and

are therefore called practical thus philosophy is

correctly divided into two parts quite distinct in8

their principles the theoretical part or natural

philosophy and the practical part or moral philosophy

for that is the name given to the practical

legislation of reason in accordance with the concept

of freedom but up to the present a gross misuse

of these expressions has prevailed both in the

division of the different principles and consequently

also of philosophy itself for what is practical

according to natural concepts has been identified

with the practical according to the concept of freedom

and so with the like titles theoretical and

practical philosophy a division has been made

by which in fact nothing has been divided for both

parts might in such case have principles of the same

kind
the will regarded as the faculty of desire is in

this view one of the many natural causes in the

world viz that cause which acts in accordance with

concepts all that is represented as possible or

necessary by means of a will is called practically

possible or necessary as distinguished from the

physical possibility or necessity of an effect whose

cause is not determined to causality by concepts

but in lifeless matter by mechanism and in animals

by instinct here in respect of the practical it is

left undetermined whether the concept which gives

the rule to the causality of the will is a natural concept

or a concept of freedom
but the last distinction is essential for if the

concept which determines the causality is a natural

concept then the principles are technically practical

whereas if it is a concept of freedom they are morally

practical and as the division of a rational science

depends on the distinction between objects whose

cognition needs distinct principles the former will9

belong to theoretical philosophy doctrine of nature

but the latter alone will constitute the second part

viz practical philosophy doctrine of morals
all technically practical rules ie the rules of art

and skill generally or of prudence regarded as skill

in exercising an influence over men and their wills

so far as their principles rest on concepts must be

reckoned only as corollaries to theoretical philosophy

for they concern only the possibility of things according

to natural concepts to which belong not

only the means which are to be met with in nature

but also the will itself as a faculty of desire and

consequently a natural faculty so far as it can be

determined conformably to these rules by natural

motives however practical rules of this kind are

not called laws like physical laws but only precepts

because the will does not stand merely under

the natural concept but also under the concept of

freedom in relation to which its principles are called

laws these with their consequences alone constitute

the second or practical part of philosophy
the solution of the problems of pure geometry

does not belong to a particular part of the science

mensuration does not deserve the name of practical

in contrast to pure geometry as a second part of

geometry in general and just as little ought the

mechanical or chemical art of experiment or observation

to be reckoned as a practical part of the

doctrine of nature just as little in fine ought

housekeeping farming statesmanship the art of

conversation the prescribing of diet the universal

doctrine of happiness itself or the curbing of the

inclinations and checking of the affections for the

sake of happiness to be reckoned as practical philosophy

or taken to constitute the second part of10

philosophy in general for all these contain only

rules of skill and are consequently only technically

practical for bringing about an effect that is possible

according to the natural concepts of causes and

effects which since they belong to theoretical philosophy

are subject to those precepts as mere corollaries

from it viz natural science and can therefore

claim no place in a special philosophy called practical

on the other hand the morally practical precepts

which are altogether based on the concept of freedom

to the complete exclusion of the natural determining

grounds of the will constitute a quite special class

these like the rules which nature obeys are called

simply laws but they do not like them rest on

sensuous conditions but on a supersensible principle

and accordingly they require for themselves

a quite different part of philosophy called practical

corresponding to its theoretical part
we hence see that a complex of practical precepts

given by philosophy does not constitute a

distinct part of philosophy as opposed to the theoretical

part because these precepts are practical for

they might be that even if their principles were

derived altogether from the theoretical cognition of

nature as technically practical rules a distinct

branch of philosophy is constituted only if their

principle as it is not borrowed from the natural

concept which is always sensuously conditioned

rests on the supersensible which alone makes the

concept of freedom cognisable by formal laws

these precepts are then morally practical ie not

merely precepts or rules in this or that aspect but

without any preceding reference to purposes and

designs are laws
11
ii of the realm of philosophy in general
so far as our concepts have a priori application

so far extends the use of our cognitive faculty according

to principles and with it philosophy
but the complex of all objects to which those

concepts are referred in order to bring about a

knowledge of them where it is possible may be subdivided

according to the adequacy or inadequacy of

our cognitive faculty to this design
concepts so far as they are referred to objects

independently of the possibility or impossibility of

the cognition of these objects have their field which

is determined merely according to the relation that

their object has to our cognitive faculty in general

the part of this field in which knowledge is possible

for us is a ground or territory territorium for these

concepts and the requisite cognitive faculty the

part of this territory where they are legislative is

the realm ditio of these concepts and of the corresponding

cognitive faculties empirical concepts

have therefore their territory in nature as the complex

of all objects of sense but no realm only a

dwellingplace domicilium for though they are

produced in conformity to law they are not legislative

but the rules based on them are empirical and

consequently contingent
our whole cognitive faculty has two realms that

of natural concepts and that of the concept of freedom

for through both it is legislative a priori in

accordance with this philosophy is divided into

theoretical and practical but the territory to which

its realm extends and in which its legislation is

exercised is always only the complex of objects of

all possible experience so long as they are taken for12

nothing more than mere phenomena for otherwise

no legislation of the understanding in respect of

them is conceivable
legislation through natural concepts is carried

on by means of the understanding and is theoretical

legislation through the concept of freedom is carried

on by the reason and is merely practical it is only

in the practical sphere that the reason can be

legislative in respect of theoretical cognition of

nature it can merely as acquainted with law by

the understanding deduce from given laws consequences

which always remain within the limits of

nature but on the other hand reason is not

always therefore legislative where there are practical

rules for they may be only technically practical
understanding and reason exercise therefore

two distinct legislations in regard to one and the same

territory of experience without prejudice to each

other the concept of freedom as little disturbs

the legislation of nature as the natural concept influences

the legislation through the formerthe

possibility of at least thinking without contradiction

the coexistence of both legislations and of the corresponding

faculties in the same subject has been

shown in the critique of pure reason for it annulled

the objections on the other side by exposing the

dialectical illusion which they contain
these two different realms then do not limit

each other in their legislation though they perpetually

do so in the world of sense that they

do not constitute one realm arises from this that

the natural concept represents its objects in intuition

not as things in themselves but as mere phenomena

the concept of freedom on the other hand represents

in its object a thing in itself but not in13

intuition hence neither of them can furnish a

theoretical knowledge of its object or even of

the thinking subject as a thing in itself this would

be the supersensible the idea of which we must

indeed make the basis of the possibility of all these

objects of experience but which we can never extend

or elevate into a cognition
there is then an unbounded but also inaccessible

field for our whole cognitive facultythe field

of the supersensiblewherein we find no territory

and therefore can have in it for theoretical cognition

no realm either for concepts of understanding

or reason this field we must indeed occupy with

ideas on behalf of the theoretical as well as the

practical use of reason but we can supply to them

in reference to the laws arising from the concept

of freedom no other than practical reality by which

our theoretical cognition is not extended in the

slightest degree towards the supersensible
now even if an immeasurable gulf is fixed

between the sensible realm of the concept of nature

and the supersensible realm of the concept of freedom

so that no transition is possible from the first to

the second by means of the theoretical use of

reason just as if they were two different worlds

of which the first could have no influence upon

the second yet the second is meant to have an influence

upon the first the concept of freedom is

meant to actualise in the world of sense the purpose

proposed by its laws and consequently nature must

be so thought that the conformity to law of its form

at least harmonises with the possibility of the

purposes to be effected in it according to laws of

freedomthere must therefore be a ground of

the unity of the supersensible which lies at the14

basis of nature with that which the concept of

freedom practically contains and the concept of

this ground although it does not attain either

theoretically or practically to a knowledge of the

same and hence has no peculiar realm nevertheless

makes possible the transition from the mode of

thought according to the principles of the one to

that according to the principles of the other
iii of the critique of judgement as a means of

combining the two parts of philosophy into

a whole
the critique of the cognitive faculties as regards

what they can furnish a priori has properly speaking

no realm in respect of objects because it is not a

doctrine but only has to investigate whether and

how in accordance with the state of these faculties a

doctrine is possible by their means its field extends

to all their pretensions in order to confine them

within their legitimate bounds but what cannot

enter into the division of philosophy may yet enter

as a chief part into the critique of the pure faculty

of cognition in general viz if it contains principles

which are available neither for theoretical nor for

practical use
the natural concepts which contain the ground

of all theoretical knowledge a priori rest on the

legislation of the understandingthe concept of

freedom which contains the ground of all sensuouslyunconditioned

practical precepts a priori rests on

the legislation of the reason both faculties therefore

besides being capable of application as regards

their logical form to principles of whatever origin

have also as regards their content their special15

legislations above which there is no other a priori

and hence the division of philosophy into theoretical

and practical is justified
but in the family of the higher cognitive

faculties there is a middle term between the understanding

and the reason this is the judgement of

which we have cause for supposing according to

analogy that it may contain in itself if not a special

legislation yet a special principle of its own to be

sought according to laws though merely subjective

a priori this principle even if it have no field

of objects as its realm yet may have somewhere a

territory with a certain character for which no other

principle can be valid
but besides to judge by analogy there is a

new ground for bringing the judgement into connexion

with another arrangement of our representative

faculties which seems to be of even

greater importance than that of its relationship

with the family of the cognitive faculties for all

faculties or capacities of the soul can be reduced to

three which cannot be any further derived from one

common ground the faculty of knowledge the feeling

of pleasure and pain and the faculty of desire916

for the faculty of knowledge the understanding is

alone legislative if as must happen when it is considered

by itself without confusion with the faculty

of desire this faculty is referred to nature as the

faculty of theoretical knowledge for in respect of

nature as phenomenon it is alone possible for us

to give laws by means of natural concepts a priori

ie by pure concepts of understandingfor the

faculty of desire as a higher faculty according to the

concept of freedom the reason in which alone this17

concept has a place is alone a priori legislativenow

between the faculties of knowledge and desire

there is the feeling of pleasure just as the judgement

is intermediate between the understanding

and the reason we may therefore suppose provisionally

that the judgement likewise contains in

itself an a priori principle and as pleasure or

pain is necessarily combined with the faculty of

desire either preceding this principle as in the

lower desires or following it as in the higher when

the desire is determined by the moral law we may

also suppose that the judgement will bring about a

transition from the pure faculty of knowledge the

realm of natural concepts to the realm of the concept

of freedom just as in its logical use it makes

possible the transition from understanding to

reason
although then philosophy can be divided only

into two main parts the theoretical and the practical

and although all that we may be able to say of the

special principles of judgement must be counted as

belonging in it to the theoretical part ie to rational

cognition in accordance with natural concepts yet

the critique of pure reason which must decide all

this as regards the possibility of the system before

undertaking it consists of three parts the critique

of pure understanding of pure judgement and of

pure reason which faculties are called pure because

they are legislative a priori
iv of judgement as a faculty legislating a priori
judgement in general is the faculty of thinking

the particular as contained under the universal if

the universal the rule the principle the law be18

given the judgement which subsumes the particular

under it even if as transcendental judgement it

furnishes a priori the conditions in conformity with

which subsumption under that universal is alone

possible is determinant but if only the particular

be given for which the universal has to be found

the judgement is merely reflective
the determinant judgement only subsumes under

universal transcendental laws given by the understanding

the law is marked out for it a priori and

it has therefore no need to seek a law for itself

in order to be able to subordinate the particular in

nature to the universalbut the forms of nature

are so manifold and there are so many modifications

of the universal transcendental natural concepts

left undetermined by the laws given a priori

by the pure understandingbecause these only

concern the possibility of a nature in general as an

object of sensethat there must be laws for these

forms also these as empirical may be contingent

from the point of view of our understanding and yet

if they are to be called laws as the concept of a

nature requires they must be regarded as necessary

in virtue of a principle of the unity of the manifold

though it be unknown to usthe reflective judgement

which is obliged to ascend from the particular

in nature to the universal requires on that account

a principle that it cannot borrow from experience

because its function is to establish the unity of all

empirical principles under higher ones and hence

to establish the possibility of their systematic subordination

such a transcendental principle then

the reflective judgement can only give as a law from

and to itself it cannot derive it from outside

because then it would be the determinant judgement19

nor can it prescribe it to nature because

reflection upon the laws of nature adjusts itself by

nature and not nature by the conditions according

to which we attempt to arrive at a concept of it

which is quite contingent in respect of these
this principle can be no other than the following

as universal laws of nature have their ground

in our understanding which prescribes them to

nature although only according to the universal

concept of it as nature so particular empirical laws

in respect of what is in them left undetermined by

these universal laws must be considered in accordance

with such a unity as they would have if an

understanding although not our understanding

had furnished them to our cognitive faculties so as

to make possible a system of experience according

to particular laws of nature not as if in this

way such an understanding must be assumed as

actual for it is only our reflective judgement to

which this idea serves as a principlefor reflecting

not for determining but this faculty thus gives a

law only to itself and not to nature
now the concept of an object so far as it contains

the ground of the actuality of this object is the

purpose and the agreement of a thing with that

constitution of things which is only possible according

to purposes is called the purposiveness of its

form thus the principle of judgement in respect

of the form of things of nature under empirical laws

generally is the purposiveness of nature in its manifoldness

that is nature is represented by means of this

concept as if an understanding contained the ground

of the unity of the manifold of its empirical laws
the purposiveness of nature is therefore a particular

concept a priori which has its origin solely20

in the reflective judgement for we cannot ascribe

to natural products anything like a reference of

nature in them to purposes we can only use this

concept to reflect upon such products in respect of

the connexion of phenomena which is given in nature

according to empirical laws this concept is also

quite different from practical purposiveness in

human art or in morals though it is certainly

thought according to the analogy of these last
v the principle of the formal purposiveness

of nature is a transcendental principle of judgement
a transcendental principle is one by means of

which is represented a priori the universal condition

under which alone things can be in general

objects of our cognition on the other hand a

principle is called metaphysical if it represents the

a priori condition under which alone objects whose

concept must be empirically given can be further

determined a priori thus the principle of the

cognition of bodies as substances and as changeable

substances is transcendental if thereby it is asserted

that their changes must have a cause it is metaphysical

if it asserts that their changes must have an

external cause for in the former case bodies need

only be thought by means of ontological predicates

pure concepts of understanding eg substance

in order to cognise the proposition a priori but in

the latter case the empirical concept of a body as a

movable thing in space must lie at the basis of the

proposition although once this basis has been laid

down it may be seen completely a priori that this

latter predicate motion only by external causes21

belongs to bodythus as i shall presently show

the principle of the purposiveness of nature in the

manifoldness of its empirical laws is a transcendental

principle for the concept of objects so far as

they are thought as standing under this principle is

only the pure concept of objects of possible empirical

cognition in general and contains nothing empirical

on the other hand the principle of practical purposiveness

which must be thought in the idea of the

determination of a free will is a metaphysical principle

because the concept of a faculty of desire as

a will must be given empirically ie does not belong

to transcendental predicates both principles are

however not empirical but a priori because for

the combination of the predicate with the empirical

concept of the subject of their judgements no further

experience is needed but it can be apprehended

completely a priori
that the concept of a purposiveness of nature

belongs to transcendental principles can be sufficiently

seen from the maxims of the judgement which lie

at the basis of the investigation of nature a priori

and yet do not go further than the possibility of

experience and consequently of the cognition of

naturenot indeed nature in general but nature

as determined through a variety of particular laws

these maxims present themselves in the course

of this science often enough though in a scattered

way as sentences of metaphysical wisdom whose

necessity we cannot demonstrate from concepts

nature takes the shortest way lex parsimoniae

at the same time it makes no leaps either in the

course of its changes or in the juxtaposition of

specifically different forms lex continui in natura

its great variety in empirical laws is yet unity22

under a few principles principia praeter necessitatem

non sunt multiplicanda etc
if we propose to set forth the origin of these

fundamental propositions and try to do so by the

psychological method we violate their sense for

they do not tell us what happens ie by what rule

our cognitive powers actually operate and how we

judge but how we ought to judge and this logical

objective necessity does not emerge if the principles

are merely empirical hence that purposiveness of

nature for our cognitive faculties and their use which

is plainly apparent from them is a transcendental

principle of judgements and needs therefore also a

transcendental deduction by means of which the

ground for so judging must be sought in the

sources of cognition a priori
we find in the grounds of the possibility of an

experience in the very first place something necessary

viz the universal laws without which nature

in general as an object of sense cannot be thought

and these rest upon the categories applied to the

formal conditions of all intuition possible for us so

far as it is also given a priori now under these

laws the judgement is determinant for it has nothing

to do but to subsume under given laws for

example the understanding says that every change

has its cause universal law of nature the transcendental

judgement has nothing further to do than

to supply a priori the condition of subsumption

under the concept of the understanding placed

before it ie the succession in time of the determinations

of one and the same thing for nature

in general as an object of possible experience that

law is cognised as absolutely necessarybut

now the objects of empirical cognition are determined23

in many other ways than by that formal timecondition

or at least as far as we can judge a priori

are determinable hence specifically different

natures can be causes in an infinite variety of ways

as well as in virtue of what they have in common

as belonging to nature in general and each of these

modes must in accordance with the concept of a

cause in general have its rule which is a law and

therefore brings necessity with it although we do

not at all comprehend this necessity in virtue of the

constitution and the limitations of our cognitive

faculties we must therefore think in nature in

respect of its merely empirical laws a possibility of

infinitely various empirical laws which are as far as

our insight goes contingent cannot be cognised a

priori and in respect of which we judge nature

according to empirical laws and the possibility of the

unity of experience as a system according to empirical

laws to be contingent but such a unity

must be necessarily presupposed and assumed for

otherwise there would be no thoroughgoing connexion

of empirical cognitions in a whole of experience

the universal laws of nature no doubt

furnish such a connexion of things according to

their kind as things of nature in general but not

specifically as such particular beings of nature

hence the judgement must assume for its special

use this principle a priori that what in the particular

empirical laws of nature is from the human point

of view contingent yet contains a unity of law in

the combination of its manifold into an experience

possible in itselfa unity not indeed to be fathomed

by us but yet thinkable consequently as the unity

of law in a combination which we cognise as contingent

in itself although in conformity with a24

necessary design a need of understanding is represented

as the purposiveness of objects here of

nature so must the judgement which in respect

of things under possible not yet discovered empirical

laws is merely reflection think of nature in

respect of the latter according to a principle of

purposiveness for our cognitive faculty which then is

expressed in the above maxims of the judgement

this transcendental concept of a purposiveness of

nature is neither a natural concept nor a concept of

freedom because it ascribes nothing to the object

of nature but only represents the peculiar way in

which we must proceed in reflection upon the

objects of nature in reference to a thoroughly connected

experience and is consequently a subjective

principle maxim of the judgement hence as if

it were a lucky chance favouring our design we are

rejoiced properly speaking relieved of a want if

we meet with such systematic unity under merely

empirical laws although we must necessarily assume

that there is such a unity without our comprehending

it or being able to prove it
in order to convince ourselves of the correctness

of this deduction of the concept before us and the

necessity of assuming it as a transcendental principle

of cognition just consider the magnitude of the

problem the problem which lies a priori in our

understanding is to make a connected experience

out of given perceptions of a nature containing at

all events an infinite variety of empirical laws the

understanding is no doubt in possession a priori

of universal laws of nature without which nature

could not be an object of experience but it needs

in addition a certain order of nature in its particular

rules which can only be empirically known and25

which are as regards the understanding contingent

these rules without which we could not proceed

from the universal analogy of a possible experience

in general to the particular must be thought by it as

laws ie as necessary for otherwise they would

not constitute an order of nature although their

necessity can never be cognised or comprehended

by it although therefore the understanding can

determine nothing a priori in respect of objects it

must in order to trace out these empirical socalled

laws place at the basis of all reflection upon objects

an a priori principle viz that a cognisable order

of nature is possible in accordance with these laws

the following propositions express some such principle

there is in nature a subordination of genera

and species comprehensible by us each one

approximates to some other according to a common

principle so that a transition from one to another

and so on to a higher genus may be possible

though it seems at the outset unavoidable for our

understanding to assume different kinds of causality

for the specific differences of natural operations yet

these different kinds may stand under a small

number of principles with the investigation of which

we have to busy ourselves this harmony of nature

with our cognitive faculty is presupposed a priori

by the judgement on behalf of its reflection upon

nature in accordance with its empirical laws whilst

the understanding at the same time cognises it

objectively as contingent and it is only the judgement

that ascribes it to nature as a trancendental

purposiveness in relation to the cognitive faculty of

the subject for without this presupposition we

should have no order of nature in accordance with

empirical laws and consequently no guiding thread26

for an experience ordered by these in all their variety

or for an investigation of them
for it might easily be thought that in spite of

all the uniformity of natural things according to the

universal laws without which we should not have

the form of an empirical cognition in general the

specific variety of the empirical laws of nature

including their effects might yet be so great that

it would be impossible for our understanding to

detect in nature a comprehensible order to divide

its products into genera and species so as to use

the principles which explain and make intelligible

one for the explanation and comprehension of

another or out of such confused material strictly

we should say so infinitely various and not to be

measured by our faculty of comprehension to make

a connected experience
the judgement has therefore also in itself a

principle a priori of the possibility of nature but

only in a subjective aspect by which it prescribes

not to nature autonomy but to itself heautonomy

a law for its reflection upon nature this we might

call the law of the specification of nature in respect

of its empirical laws the judgement does not

cognise this a priori in nature but assumes it on

behalf of a natural order cognisable by our understanding

in the division which it makes of the

universal laws of nature when it wishes to subordinate

to these the variety of particular laws if then we

say that nature specifies its universal laws according

to the principles of purposiveness for our cognitive

faculty ie in accordance with the necessary business

of the human understanding of finding the universal

for the particular which perception offers it and again

of finding connexion for the diverse which however27

is a universal for each species in the unity of

a principlewe thus neither prescribe to nature a

law nor do we learn one from it by observation

although such a principle may be confirmed by this

means for it is not a principle of the determinant

but merely of the reflective judgement we only

require that be nature disposed as it may as regards

its universal laws investigation into its empirical

laws may be carried on in accordance with that

principle and the maxims founded thereon because

it is only so far as that holds that we can make

any progress with the use of our understanding in

experience or gain knowledge
vi of the combination of the feeling of

pleasure with the concept of the purposiveness of nature
the thought harmony of nature in the variety

of its particular laws with our need of finding

universality of principles for it must be judged as

contingent in respect of our insight but yet at the

same time as indispensable for the needs of our

understanding and consequently as a purposiveness

by which nature is harmonised with our design

which however has only knowledge for its aim

the universal laws of the understanding which

are at the same time laws of nature are just as

necessary although arising from spontaneity as the

material laws of motion their production presupposes

no design on the part of our cognitive

faculty because it is only by means of them that

we in the first place attain a concept of what the

cognition of things of nature is and attribute them

necessarily to nature as object of our cognition in28

general but so far as we can see it is contingent

that the order of nature according to its particular

laws in all its variety and heterogeneity possibly at

least transcending our comprehension should be

actually conformable to these laws the discovery

of this order is the business of the understanding

which is designedly borne towards a necessary

purpose viz the bringing of unity of principles into

nature which purpose then the judgement must

ascribe to nature because the understanding cannot

here prescribe any law to it
the attainment of that design is bound up with

the feeling of pleasure and since the condition of this

attainment is a representation a priorias here a

principle for the reflective judgement in generaltherefore

the feeling of pleasure is determined by a

ground a priori and valid for every man and that

merely by the reference of the object to the cognitive

faculty the concept of purposiveness here not having

the least reference to the faculty of desire it is thus

quite distinguished from all practical purposiveness

of nature
in fact although from the agreement of perceptions

with laws in accordance with universal

natural concepts the categories we do not and

cannot find in ourselves the slightest effect upon the

feeling of pleasure because the understanding

necessarily proceeds according to its nature without

any design yet on the other hand the discovery

that two or more empirical heterogeneous laws of

nature may be combined under one principle comprehending

them both is the ground of a very

marked pleasure often even of an admiration which

does not cease though we may be already quite

familiar with the objects of it we no longer find it29

is true any marked pleasure in the comprehensibility

of nature and in the unity of its divisions into genera

and species whereby are possible all empirical concepts

through which we cognise it according to

its particular laws but this pleasure has certainly

been present at one time and it is only because the

commonest experience would be impossible without

it that it is gradually confounded with mere cognition

and no longer arrests particular attention there is

then something in our judgements upon nature which

makes us attentive to its purposiveness for our understandingan

endeavour to bring where possible its

dissimilar laws under higher ones though still always

empiricaland thus if successful makes us feel pleasure

in that harmony of these with our cognitive

faculty which harmony we regard as merely contingent

on the other hand a representation of nature

would altogether displease by which it should be

foretold to us that in the smallest investigation

beyond the commonest experience we should meet

with a heterogeneity of its laws which would make the

union of its particular laws under universal empirical

laws impossible for our understanding for this

would contradict the principle of the subjectivelypurposive

specification of nature in its genera and

also of our reflective judgement in respect of such

principle
this presupposition of the judgement is however

at the same time so indeterminate as to how far that

ideal purposiveness of nature for our cognitive

faculty should be extended that if we were told that

a deeper or wider knowledge of nature derived from

observation must lead at last to a variety of laws

which no human understanding could reduce to a

principle we should at once acquiesce but still30

we more gladly listen to one who offers hope that

the more we know nature internally and can compare

it with external members now unknown to us the

more simple shall we find it in its principles and that

the further our experience reaches the more uniform

shall we find it amid the apparent heterogeneity of

its empirical laws for it is a mandate of our

judgement to proceed according to the principle of

the harmony of nature with our cognitive faculty so

far as that reaches without deciding because it is

not the determinant judgement which gives us this

rule whether or not it is bounded anywhere for

although in respect of the rational use of our cognitive

faculty we can determine such bounds this is not

possible in the empirical field
vii of the aesthetical representation of the

purposiveness of nature
that which in the representation of an object

is merely subjective ie which decides its reference

to the subject not to the object is its aesthetical

character but that which serves or can be used for

the determination of the object for cognition is its

logical validity in the cognition of an object of

sense both references present themselves in the

senserepresentation of external things the quality

of space wherein we intuite them is the merely

subjective element of my representation by which

it remains undecided what they may be in themselves

as objects on account of which reference

the object is thought thereby merely as phenomenon

but space notwithstanding its merely subjective

quality is at the same time an ingredient in the

cognition of things as phenomena sensation again31

ie external sensation expresses the merely subjective

element of our representations of external

things but it is also the proper material reale of

them by which something existing is given just

as space is the mere form a priori of the possibility

of their intuition nevertheless however sensation

is also employed in the cognition of external objects
but the subjective element in a representation

which cannot be an ingredient of cognition is the

pleasure or pain which is bound up with it for

through it i cognise nothing in the object of the

representation although it may be the effect of some

cognition now the purposiveness of a thing so

far as it is represented in perception is no characteristic

of the object itself for such cannot be perceived

although it may be inferred from a cognition of

things the purposiveness therefore which precedes

the cognition of an object and which even

without our wishing to use the representation of it

for cognition is at the same time immediately

bound up with it is that subjective element which

cannot be an ingredient in cognition hence the

object is only called purposive when its representation

is immediately combined with the feeling of

pleasure and this very representation is an aesthetical

representation of purposivenessthe only

question is whether there is in general such a

representation of purposiveness
if pleasure is bound up with the mere apprehension

apprehensio of the form of an object of intuition

without reference to a concept for a definite

cognition then the representation is thereby not

referred to the object but simply to the subject

and the pleasure can express nothing else than its

harmony with the cognitive faculties which come32

into play in the reflective judgement and so far as

they are in play and hence can only express a

subjective formal purposiveness of the object for

that apprehension of forms in the imagination can

never take place without the reflective judgement

though undesignedly at least comparing them with

its faculty of referring intuitions to concepts if

now in this comparison the imagination as the

faculty of a priori intuitions is placed by means

of a given representation undesignedly in agreement

with the understanding as the faculty of concepts

and thus a feeling of pleasure is aroused the object

must then be regarded as purposive for the reflective

judgement such a judgement is an aesthetical

judgement upon the purposiveness of the object

which does not base itself upon any present concept

of the object nor does it furnish any such in the

case of an object whose form not the matter of its

representation as sensation in the mere reflection

upon it without reference to any concept to be

obtained of it is judged as the ground of a pleasure

in the representation of such an object this pleasure

is judged as bound up with the representation

necessarily and consequently not only for the

subject which apprehends this form but for every

judging being in general the object is then called

beautiful and the faculty of judging by means of

such a pleasure and consequently with universal

validity is called taste for since the ground of

the pleasure is placed merely in the form of the

object for reflection in generaland consequently

in no sensation of the object and also without

reference to any concept which anywhere involves

designit is only the conformity to law in the

empirical use of the judgement in general unity of33

the imagination with the understanding in the

subject with which the representation of the object

in reflection whose conditions are universally valid

a priori harmonises and since this harmony of

the object with the faculties of the subject is contingent

it brings about the representation of its

purposiveness in respect of the cognitive faculties of

the subject
here now is a pleasure which like all pleasure

or pain that is not produced through the concept of

freedom ie through the preceding determination

of the higher faculties of desire by pure reason

can never be comprehended from concepts as

necessarily bound up with the representation of an

object it must always be cognised as combined

with this only by means of reflective perception

and consequently like all empirical judgements it

can declare no objective necessity and lay claim to

no a priori validity but the judgement of taste

also claims as every other empirical judgement does

to be valid for every one and in spite of its inner

contingency this is always possible the strange

and irregular thing is that it is not an empirical

concept but a feeling of pleasure consequently not

a concept at all which by the judgement of taste is

attributed to every onejust as if it were a predicate

bound up with the cognition of the objectand

which is connected with the representation thereof
a singular judgement of experience eg when we

perceive a moveable drop of water in an icecrystal

may justly claim that every one else should find it

the same because we have formed this judgement

according to the universal conditions of the determinant

faculty of judgement under the laws of a

possible experience in general just in the same34

way he who feels pleasure in the mere reflection

upon the form of an object without respect to any

concept although this judgement be empirical and

singular justly claims the agreement of every one

because the ground of this pleasure is found in the

universal although subjective condition of reflective

judgements viz the purposive harmony of an object

whether a product of nature or of art with the

mutual relations of the cognitive faculties the

imagination and the understanding a harmony

which is requisite for every empirical cognition

the pleasure therefore in the judgement of taste is

dependent on an empirical representation and cannot

be bound up a priori with any concept we cannot

determine a priori what object is or is not according

to taste that we must find out by experiment

but the pleasure is the determining ground of this

judgement only because we are conscious that it rests

merely on reflection and on the universal though

only subjective conditions of the harmony of that

reflection with the cognition of objects in general

for which the form of the object is purposive
thus the reason why judgements of taste according

to their possibility are subjected to a critique

is that they presuppose a principle a priori although

this principle is neither one of cognition for the

understanding nor of practice for the will and

therefore is not in any way determinant a priori
susceptibility to pleasure from reflection upon

the forms of things of nature as well as of art

indicates not only a purposiveness of the objects

in relation to the reflective judgement conformably

to the concept of nature in the subject but also

conversely a purposiveness of the subject in respect

of the objects according to their form or even their35

formlessness in virtue of the concept of freedom

hence the aesthetical judgement is not only related

as a judgement of taste to the beautiful but also

as springing from a spiritual feeling is related to

the sublime and thus the critique of the aesthetical

judgement must be divided into two corresponding

sections
viii of the logical representation of the

purposiveness of nature
purposiveness may be represented in an object

given in experience on a merely subjective ground

as the harmony of its formin the apprehension

apprehensio of it prior to any conceptwith the

cognitive faculties in order to unite the intuition

with concepts for a cognition generally or it

may be represented objectively as the harmony

of the form of the object with the possibility of the

thing itself according to a concept of it which

precedes and contains the ground of this form

we have seen that the representation of purposiveness

of the first kind rests on the immediate

pleasure in the form of the object in the mere

reflection upon it but the representation of purposiveness

of the second kind since it refers the

form of the object not to the cognitive faculties

of the subject in the apprehension of it but to a

definite cognition of the object under a given concept

has nothing to do with a feeling of pleasure in

things but only with the understanding in its judgement

upon them if the concept of an object is

given the business of the judgement in the use of

the concept for cognition consists in presentation

exhibitio ie in setting a corresponding intuition

beside the concept this may take place either36

through our own imagination as in art when we

realise a preconceived concept of an object which

is a purpose of ours or through nature in its technic

as in organised bodies when we supply to it our concept

of its purpose in order to judge of its products

in the latter case it is not merely the purposiveness

of nature in the form of the thing that is represented

but this its product is represented as a natural

purposealthough our concept of a subjective

purposiveness of nature in its forms according to

empirical laws is not a concept of the object

but only a principle of the judgement for furnishing

itself with concepts amid the immense variety

of nature and thus being able to ascertain its own

position yet we thus ascribe to nature as it

were a regard to our cognitive faculty according

to the analogy of purpose thus we can regard

natural beauty as the presentation of the concept

of the formal merely subjective purposiveness

and natural purposes as the presentation of the

concept of a real objective purposiveness the

former of these we judge of by taste aesthetically

by the medium of the feeling of pleasure the latter

by understanding and reason logically according

to concepts
on this is based the division of the critique of

judgement into the critique of aesthetical and of

teleological judgement by the first we understand

the faculty of judging of the formal purposiveness

otherwise called subjective of nature by means of

the feeling of pleasure or pain by the second the

faculty of judging its real objective purposiveness

by means of understanding and reason
in a critique of judgement the part containing the

aesthetical judgement is essential because this alone37

contains a principle which the judgement places

quite a priori at the basis of its reflection upon

nature viz the principle of a formal purposiveness

of nature according to its particular empirical laws

for our cognitive faculty without which the understanding

could not find itself in nature on the

other hand no reason a priori could be specifiedand

even the possibility of a reason would not be

apparent from the concept of nature as an object

of experience whether general or particularwhy

there should be objective purposes of nature ie

things which are only possible as natural purposes

but the judgement without containing such a

principle a priori in itself in given cases of certain

products in order to make use of the concept of

purposes on behalf of reason would only contain

the rule according to which that transcendental

principle has already prepared the understanding

to apply to nature the concept of a purpose at least

as regards its form
but the transcendental principle which represents

a purposiveness of nature in subjective reference to

our cognitive faculty in the form of a thing as a

principle by which we judge of nature leaves it

quite undetermined where and in what cases i have

to judge of a product according to a principle of

purposiveness and not rather according to universal

natural laws it leaves it to the aesthetical judgement

to decide by taste the harmony of this product

of its form with our cognitive faculty so far as this

decision rests not on any agreement with concepts

but on feeling on the other hand the judgement

teleologically employed furnishes conditions determinately

under which something eg an organised

body is to be judged according to the idea of a38

purpose of nature but it can adduce no fundamental

proposition from the concept of nature as an object

of experience authorising it to ascribe to nature a

priori a reference to purposes or even indeterminately

to assume this of such products in actual experience

the reason of this is that we must have many

particular experiences and consider them under the

unity of their principle in order to be able to cognise

even empirically objective purposiveness in a certain

objectthe aesthetical judgement is therefore

a special faculty for judging of things according to

a rule but not according to concepts the teleological

judgement is not a special faculty but only

the reflective judgement in general so far as it

proceeds as it always does in theoretical cognition

according to concepts but in respect of certain

objects of nature according to special principles viz

of a merely reflective judgement and not of a judgement

that determines objects thus as regards its

application it belongs to the theoretical part of philosophy

and on account of its special principles which

are not determinant as they must be in doctrine

it must constitute a special part of the critique on

the other hand the aesthetical judgement contributes

nothing towards the knowledge of its objects and

thus must be reckoned as belonging to the criticism

of the judging subject and its cognitive faculties

only so far as they are susceptible of a priori

principles of whatever other use theoretical or

practical they may be this is the propaedeutic

of all philosophy
39
ix of the connexion of the legislation of understanding

with that of reason by means of the judgement
the understanding legislates a priori for nature

as an object of sensefor a theoretical knowledge

of it in a possible experience reason legislates a

priori for freedom and its peculiar casuality as the

supersensible in the subject for an unconditioned

practical knowledge the realm of the natural

concept under the one legislation and that of the

concept of freedom under the other are entirely

removed from all mutual influence which they might

have on one another each according to its fundamental

laws by the great gulf that separates the

supersensible from phenomena the concept of

freedom determines nothing in respect of the

theoretical cognition of nature and the natural concept

determines nothing in respect of the practical

laws of freedom so far then it is not possible to

throw a bridge from the one realm to the other

but although the determining grounds of causality

according to the concept of freedom and the

practical rules which it contains are not resident

in nature and the sensible cannot determine the

supersensible in the subject yet this is possible

conversely not to be sure in respect of the cognition

of nature but as regards the effects of the supersensible

upon the sensible this in fact is involved

in the concept of a causality through freedom the

effect of which is to take place in the world according

to its formal laws the word cause of course

when used of the supersensible only signifies the

ground which determines the causality of natural40

things to an effect in accordance with their proper

natural laws although harmoniously with the formal

principle of the laws of reason although the

possibility of this cannot be comprehended yet the

objection of a contradiction alleged to be found in

it can be sufficiently answered10the effect in

accordance with the concept of freedom is the final

purpose which or its phenomenon in the world of

sense ought to exist and the condition of the

possibility of this is presupposed in nature in the

nature of the subject as a sensible being that is as

man the judgement presupposes this a priori

and without reference to the practical and thus

furnishes the mediating concept between the concepts

of nature and that of freedom it makes

possible the transition from the conformity to law

in accordance with the former to the final purpose

in accordance with the latter and this by the

concept of a purposiveness of nature for thus is

cognised the possibility of the final purpose which

alone can be actualised in nature in harmony with

its laws
the understanding by the possibility of its a41

priori laws for nature gives a proof that nature is

only cognised by us as phenomenon and implies

at the same time that it has a supersensible substrate

though it leaves this quite undetermined

the judgement by its a priori principle for the

judging of nature according to its possible particular

laws makes the supersensible substrate both in

us and without us determinable by means of the

intellectual faculty but the reason by its practical

a priori law determines it and thus the judgement

makes possible the transition from the realm of the

concept of nature to that of the concept of freedom
as regards the faculties of the soul in general

in their higher aspect as containing an autonomy

the understanding is that which contains the constitutive

principles a priori for the cognitive faculty

the theoretical cognition of nature for the feeling

of pleasure and pain there is the judgement independently

of concepts and sensations which relate to the

determination of the faculty of desire and can thus

be immediately practical for the faculty of desire

there is the reason which is practical without

the mediation of any pleasure whatever it determines

for the faculty of desire as a superior faculty

the final purpose which carries with it the pure

intellectual satisfaction in the objectthe concept

formed by judgement of a purposiveness of

nature belongs to natural concepts but only as

a regulative principle of the cognitive faculty

although the aesthetical judgement upon certain

objects of nature or art which occasions it is

in respect of the feeling of pleasure or pain a

constitutive principle the spontaneity in the play

of the cognitive faculties the harmony of which

contains the ground of this pleasure makes the42

above concept of the purposiveness of nature fit to

be the mediating link between the realm of the

natural concept and that of the concept of freedom

in its effects whilst at the same time it promotes

the sensibility of the mind for moral feelingthe

first division
analytic of the aesthetical judgement
 first book
analytic of the beautiful

first moment
of the judgement of taste12 according to quality
 1 the judgement of taste is aesthetical
in order to decide whether anything is beautiful

or not we refer the representation not by the

understanding to the object for cognition but by

the imagination perhaps in conjunction with the

understanding to the subject and its feeling of

pleasure or pain the judgement of taste is therefore

not a judgement of cognition and is consequently

not logical but aesthetical by which we

understand that whose determining ground can be46
no other than subjective every reference of representations

even that of sensations may be objective

and then it signifies the real in an empirical representation

save only the reference to the feeling

of pleasure and pain by which nothing in the

object is signified but through which there is

a feeling in the subject as it is affected by the

representation
to apprehend a regular purposive building by

means of ones cognitive faculty whether in a

clear or a confused way of representation is something

quite different from being conscious of this

representation as connected with the sensation of

satisfaction here the representation is altogether

referred to the subject and to its feeling of life under

the name of the feeling of pleasure or pain this

establishes a quite separate faculty of distinction

and of judgement adding nothing to cognition but

only comparing the given representation in the

subject with the whole faculty of representations of

which the mind is conscious in the feeling of its

state given representations in a judgement can

be empirical consequently aesthetical but the

judgement which is formed by means of them is

logical provided they are referred in the judgement

to the object conversely if the given representations

are rational but are referred in a judgement

simply to the subject to its feeling the judgement

is so far always aesthetical
 2 the satisfaction which determines the

judgement of taste is disinterested
the satisfaction which we combine with the

representation of the existence of an object is called47

interest such satisfaction always has reference to

the faculty of desire either as its determining ground

or as necessarily connected with its determining

ground now when the question is if a thing is

beautiful we do not want to know whether anything

depends or can depend on the existence of the thing

either for myself or for any one else but how we

judge it by mere observation intuition or reflection

if any one asks me if i find that palace beautiful

which i see before me i may answer i do not like

things of that kind which are made merely to be

stared at or i can answer like that iroquois

sachem who was pleased in paris by nothing more

than by the cookshops or again after the manner

of rousseau i may rebuke the vanity of the great

who waste the sweat of the people on such superfluous

things in fine i could easily convince myself

that if i found myself on an uninhabited island without

the hope of ever again coming among men and

could conjure up just such a splendid building by

my mere wish i should not even give myself the

trouble if i had a sufficiently comfortable hut this

may all be admitted and approved but we are not now

talking of this we wish only to know if this mere

representation of the object is accompanied in me

with satisfaction however indifferent i may be as

regards the existence of the object of this representation

we easily see that in saying it is beautiful

and in showing that i have taste i am concerned not

with that in which i depend on the existence of the

object but with that which i make out of this representation

in myself every one must admit that

a judgement about beauty in which the least interest

mingles is very partial and is not a pure judgement

of taste we must not be in the least prejudiced in48

favour of the existence of the things but be quite

indifferent in this respect in order to play the judge

in things of taste
we cannot however better elucidate this proposition

which is of capital importance than by

contrasting the pure disinterested13 satisfaction in

judgements of taste with that which is bound up with

an interest especially if we can at the same time be

certain that there are no other kinds of interest than

those which are now to be specified
 3 the satisfaction in the pleasant is bound

up with interest
that which pleases the senses in sensation is
pleasant here the opportunity presents itself of

censuring a very common confusion of the double

sense which the word sensation can have and of

calling attention to it all satisfaction it is said or

thought is itself sensation of a pleasure consequently

everything that pleases is pleasant because

it pleases and according to its different degrees or

its relations to other pleasant sensations it is agreeable

lovely delightful enjoyable etc but if this

be admitted then impressions of sense which

determine the inclination fundamental propositions

of reason which determine the will mere reflective

forms of intuition which determine the judgement

are quite the same as regards the effect upon the

feeling of pleasure for this would be pleasantness49

in the sensation of ones state and since in the

end all the operations of our faculties must issue in

the practical and unite in it as their goal we could

suppose no other way of estimating things and their

worth than that which consists in the gratification

that they promise it is of no consequence at all

how this is attained and since then the choice of

means alone could make a difference men could

indeed blame one another for stupidity and indiscretion

but never for baseness and wickedness

for all each according to his own way of seeing

things seek one goal that is gratification
if a determination of the feeling of pleasure or

pain is called sensation this expression signifies

something quite different from what i mean when i

call the representation of a thing by sense as a

receptivity belonging to the cognitive faculty

sensation for in the latter case the representation

is referred to the object in the former simply to the

subject and is available for no cognition whatever

not even for that by which the subject cognises itself
in the above elucidation we understand by the

word sensation an objective representation of sense

and in order to avoid misinterpretation we shall call

that which must always remain merely subjective

and can constitute absolutely no representation of

an object by the ordinary term feeling the

green colour of the meadows belongs to objective

sensation as a perception of an object of sense the

pleasantness of this belongs to subjective sensation

by which no object is represented ie to feeling

by which the object is considered as an object of

satisfaction which does not furnish a cognition of it
now that a judgement about an object by which

i describe it as pleasant expresses an interest in it50

is plain from the fact that by sensation it excites a

desire for objects of that kind consequently the

satisfaction presupposes not the mere judgement

about it but the relation of its existence to my state

so far as this is affected by such an object hence

we do not merely say of the pleasant it pleases but

it gratifies i give to it no mere approval but inclination

is aroused by it and in the case of what is

pleasant in the most lively fashion there is no judgement

at all upon the character of the object for

those who always lay themselves out only for

enjoyment for that is the word describing intense

gratification would fain dispense with all judgement
 4 the satisfaction in the good is bound up

with interest
whatever by means of reason pleases through

the mere concept is good that which pleases only

as a means we call good for something the useful

but that which pleases for itself is good in itself in

both there is always involved the concept of a

purpose and consequently the relation of reason to

the at least possible volition and thus a satisfaction

in the presence of an object or an action ie some

kind of interest
in order to find anything good i must always

know what sort of a thing the object ought to be ie

i must have a concept of it but there is no need

of this to find a thing beautiful flowers free

delineations outlines intertwined with one another

without design and called foliage have no meaning

depend on no definite concept and yet they please

the satisfaction in the beautiful must depend on the

reflection upon an object leading to any concept51

however indefinite and it is thus distinguished

from the pleasant which rests entirely upon sensation
it is true the pleasant seems in many cases to

be the same as the good thus people are

accustomed to say that all gratification especially if

it lasts is good in itself which is very much the

same as to say that lasting pleasure and the good

are the same but we can soon see that this is

merely a confusion of words for the concepts

which properly belong to these expressions can

in no way be interchanged the pleasant which

as such represents the object simply in relation

to sense must first be brought by the concept of

a purpose under principles of reason in order to

call it good as an object of the will but that there

is involved a quite different relation to satisfaction

in calling that which gratifies at the same time good

may be seen from the fact that in the case of the

good the question always is whether it is mediately

or immediately good useful or good in itself but

on the contrary in the case of the pleasant there can

be no question about this at all for the word always

signifies something which pleases immediately the

same is applicable to what i call beautiful
even in common speech men distinguish the

pleasant from the good of a dish which stimulates

the taste by spices and other condiments we say unhesitatingly

that it is pleasant though it is at the

same time admitted not to be good for though it immediately

delights the senses yet mediately ie considered

by reason which looks to the after results

it displeases even in the judging of health we may

notice this distinction it is immediately pleasant

to every one possessing it at least negatively ie as

the absence of all bodily pains but in order to say52

that it is good it must be considered by reason

with reference to purposes viz that it is a state

which makes us fit for all our business finally in

respect of happiness every one believes himself

entitled to describe the greatest sum of the pleasantnesses

of life as regards both their number and their

duration as a true even as the highest good

however reason is opposed to this pleasantness

is enjoyment and if we were concerned with this

alone it would be foolish to be scrupulous as regards

the means which procure it for us or to care

whether it is obtained passively by the bounty of

nature or by our own activity and work but

reason can never be persuaded that the existence

of a man who merely lives for enjoyment however

busy he may be in this point of view has a worth

in itself even if he at the same time is conducive as

a means to the best enjoyment of others and shares

in all their gratifications by sympathy only what

he does without reference to enjoyment in full

freedom and independently of what nature can procure

for him passively gives an absolute14 worth to

his being as the existence of a person and happiness

with the whole abundance of its pleasures is

far from being an unconditioned good15
however notwithstanding all this difference between

the pleasant and the good they both agree

in this that they are always bound up with an

interest in their object this is true not only of

the pleasant 3 and the mediate good the useful53

which is pleasing as a means towards pleasantness

somewhere but also of that which is good absolutely

and in every aspect viz moral good which brings

with it the highest interest for the good is the

object of will ie of a faculty of desire determined

by reason but to will something and to have a

satisfaction in its existence ie to take an interest in

it are identical
 5 comparison of the three specifically different

kinds of satisfaction
the pleasant and the good have both a reference

to the faculty of desire and they bring with themthe

former a satisfaction pathologically conditioned

by impulses stimulithe latter a pure practical

satisfaction which is determined not merely by the

representation of the object but also by the represented

connexion of the subject with the existence

of the object it is not merely the object that

pleases but also its existence16 on the other hand

the judgement of taste is merely contemplative ie

it is a judgement which indifferent as regards the

being of an object compares its character with the

feeling of pleasure and pain but this contemplation

itself is not directed to concepts for the judgement

of taste is not a cognitive judgement either theoretical

or practical and thus is not based on concepts

nor has it concepts as its purpose
the pleasant the beautiful and the good designate

then three different relations of representations

to the feeling of pleasure and pain in reference to

which we distinguish from each other objects or

methods of representing them and the expressions54

corresponding to each by which we mark our complacency

in them are not the same that which

gratifies a man is called pleasant that which

merely pleases him is beautiful that which is

esteemed or approved17 by him ie that to which

he accords an objective worth is good pleasantness

concerns irrational animals also but beauty only

concerns men ie animal but still rational beingsnot

merely qu rational eg spirits but qu animal

also and the good concerns every rational being

in general this is a proposition which can only

be completely established and explained in the

sequel we may say that of all these three kinds

of satisfaction that of taste in the beautiful is alone

a disinterested and free satisfaction for no interest

either of sense or of reason here forces our assent

hence we may say of satisfaction that it is related

in the three aforesaid cases to inclination to favour

or to respect now favour is the only free satisfaction

an object of inclination and one that is

proposed to our desire by a law of reason leave us

no freedom in forming for ourselves anywhere an

object of pleasure all interest presupposes or

generates a want and as the determining ground

of assent it leaves the judgement about the object

no longer free
as regards the interest of inclination in the case

of the pleasant every one says that hunger is the

best sauce and everything that is eatable is relished

by people with a healthy appetite and thus a satisfaction

of this sort does not indicate choice directed

by taste it is only when the want is appeased that

we can distinguish which of many men has or has

not taste in the same way there may be manners55

conduct without virtue politeness without goodwill

decorum without modesty etc for where the

moral law speaks there is no longer objectively a

free choice as regards what is to be done and to

display taste in its fulfilment or in judging of

anothers fulfilment of it is something quite

different from manifesting the moral attitude of

thought for this involves a command and generates

a want whilst moral taste only plays with the

objects of satisfaction without attaching itself to

one of them
 explanation of the beautiful resulting

from the first moment
taste is the faculty of judging of an object or a

method of representing it by an entirely disinterested

satisfaction or dissatisfaction the object of such

satisfaction is called beautiful18

second moment
of the judgement of taste viz according to quantity
 6 the beautiful is that which apart from concepts

is represented as the object of a universal satisfaction
this explanation of the beautiful can be derived56

from the preceding explanation of it as the object of

an entirely disinterested satisfaction for the fact

of which every one is conscious that the satisfaction

is for him quite disinterested implies in his judgement

a ground of satisfaction for every one for

since it does not rest on any inclination of the

subject nor upon any other premeditated interest

but since he who judges feels himself quite free as

regards the satisfaction which he attaches to the

object he cannot find the ground of this satisfaction

in any private conditions connected with his own

subject and hence it must be regarded as grounded

on what he can presuppose in every other man

consequently he must believe that he has reason

for attributing a similar satisfaction to every one

he will therefore speak of the beautiful as if beauty

were a characteristic of the object and the judgement

logical constituting a cognition of the object by

means of concepts of it although it is only

aesthetical and involves merely a reference of the

representation of the object to the subject for it

has this similarity to a logical judgement that we

can presuppose its validity for every one but this

universality cannot arise from concepts for from

concepts there is no transition to the feeling of

pleasure or pain except in pure practical laws

which bring an interest with them such as is not

bound up with the pure judgement of taste consequently

the judgement of taste accompanied with

the consciousness of separation from all interest must

claim validity for every one without this universality

depending on objects that is there must be

bound up with it a title to subjective universality
57
 7 comparison of the beautiful with the pleasant

and the good by means of the above characteristic
as regards the pleasant every one is content

that his judgement which he bases upon private

feeling and by which he says of an object that it

pleases him should be limited merely to his own

person thus he is quite contented that if he

says canary wine is pleasant another man may

correct his expression and remind him that he ought

to say it is pleasant to me and this is the case

not only as regards the taste of the tongue the

palate and the throat but for whatever is pleasant to

any ones eyes and ears to one violet colour is soft

and lovely to another it is faded and dead one

man likes the tone of wind instruments another that

of strings to strive here with the design of

reproving as incorrect another mans judgement

which is different from our own as if the judgements

were logically opposed would be folly as regards

the pleasant therefore the fundamental proposition

is valid every one has his own taste the taste of

sense
the case is quite different with the beautiful

it would on the contrary be laughable if a man

who imagined anything to his own taste thought to

justify himself by saying this object the house

we see the coat that person wears the concert we

hear the poem submitted to our judgement is

beautiful for me for he must not call it beautiful

if it merely pleases himself many things may have

for him charm and pleasantness no one troubles himself

at that but if he gives out anything as beautiful

he supposes in others the same satisfactionhe58

judges not merely for himself but for every one and

speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things

hence he says the thing is beautiful and he does

not count on the agreement of others with this his

judgement of satisfaction because he has found this

agreement several times before but he demands it of

them he blames them if they judge otherwise and

he denies them taste which he nevertheless requires

from them here then we cannot say that each man

has his own particular taste for this would be as

much as to say that there is no taste whatever ie

no aesthetical judgement which can make a rightful

claim upon every ones assent
at the same time we find as regards the pleasant

that there is an agreement among men in their

judgements upon it in regard to which we deny taste

to some and attribute it to others by this not

meaning one of our organic senses but a faculty

of judging in respect of the pleasant generally

thus we say of a man who knows how to entertain

his guests with pleasures of enjoyment for all

the senses so that they are all pleased he has

taste but here the universality is only taken

comparatively and there emerge rules which are

only general like all empirical ones and not universal

which latter the judgement of taste upon

the beautiful undertakes or lays claim to it is a

judgement in reference to sociability so far as this

rests on empirical rules in respect of the good

it is true that judgements make rightful claim to

validity for every one but the good is represented

only by means of a concept as the object of a

universal satisfaction which is the case neither with

the pleasant nor with the beautiful
59
 8 the universality of the satisfaction is represented

in a judgement of taste only as subjective
this particular determination of the universality

of an aesthetical judgement which is to be met with

in a judgement of taste is noteworthy not indeed for

the logician but for the transcendental philosopher

it requires no small trouble to discover its origin

but we thus detect a property of our cognitive

faculty which without this analysis would remain

unknown
first we must be fully convinced of the fact

that in a judgement of taste about the beautiful

the satisfaction in the object is imputed to every one

without being based on a concept for then it would

be the good further this claim to universal

validity so essentially belongs to a judgement by

which we describe anything as beautiful that if

this were not thought in it it would never come

into our thoughts to use the expression at all

but everything which pleases without a concept

would be counted as pleasant in respect of the

latter every one has his own opinion and no one

assumes in another agreement with his judgement

of taste which is always the case in a judgement

of taste about beauty i may call the first the taste

of sense the second the taste of reflection so

far as the first lays down mere private judgements

and the second judgements supposed to be generally

valid public but in both cases aesthetical not practical

judgements about an object merely in respect

of the relation of its representation to the feeling

of pleasure and pain now here is something

strange as regards the taste of sense not only60

does experience show that its judgement of pleasure

or pain connected with anything is not valid universally

but every one is content not to impute agreement

with it to others although actually there

is often found a very extended concurrence in

these judgements on the other hand the taste

of reflection has its claim to the universal validity

of its judgements about the beautiful rejected often

enough as experience teaches although it may find

it possible as it actually does to represent judgements

which can demand this universal agreement

in fact for each of its judgements of taste it imputes

this to every one without the persons that judge

disputing as to the possibility of such a claim

although in particular cases they cannot agree as to

the correct application of this faculty
here we must in the first place remark that a

universality which does not rest on concepts of

objects not even on empirical ones is not logical

but aesthetical ie it involves no objective quantity

of the judgement but only that which is subjective

for this i use the expression general validity which

signifies the validity of the reference of a representation

not to the cognitive faculty but to the feeling

of pleasure and pain for every subject we can

avail ourselves also of the same expression for the

logical quantity of the judgement if only we prefix

objective to universal validity to distinguish it

from that which is merely subjective and aesthetical
a judgement with objective universal validity

is also always valid subjectively ie if the judgement

holds for everything contained under a given

concept it holds also for every one who represents

an object by means of this concept but from a

subjective universal validity ie aesthetical and resting61

on no concept we cannot infer that which is

logical because that kind of judgement does not

extend to the object hence the aesthetical

universality which is ascribed to a judgement must

be of a particular kind because it does not unite

the predicate of beauty with the concept of the

object considered in its whole logical sphere and

yet extends it to the whole sphere of judging

persons
in respect of logical quantity all judgements of

taste are singular judgements for because i must

refer the object immediately to my feeling of pleasure

and pain and that not by means of concepts they

cannot have the quantity of objective generally

valid judgements nevertheless if the singular representation

of the object of the judgement of taste

in accordance with the conditions determining the

latter were transformed by comparison into a concept

a logically universal judgement could result therefrom

eg i describe by a judgement of taste the

rose that i see as beautiful but the judgement

which results from the comparison of several singular

judgements roses in general are beautiful is no

longer described simply as aesthetical but as a logical

judgement based on an aesthetical one again the

judgement the rose is pleasant to smell is

although aesthetical and singular not a judgement

of taste but of sense it is distinguished from the

former by the fact that the judgement of taste carries

with it an aesthetical quantity of universality ie of

validity for every one which cannot be found in a

judgement about the pleasant it is only judgements

about the good whichalthough they also determine

satisfaction in an objecthave logical and not merely

aesthetical universality for they are valid of the62

object as cognitive of it and thus are valid for every

one
if we judge objects merely according to concepts

then all representation of beauty is lost

thus there can be no rule according to which

any one is to be forced to recognise anything as

beautiful we cannot press upon others by the

aid of any reasons or fundamental propositions

our judgement that a coat a house or a flower is

beautiful we wish to submit the object to

our own eyes as if the satisfaction in it depended

on sensation and yet if we then call the object

beautiful we believe that we speak with a universal

voice and we claim the assent of every one although

on the contrary all private sensation can only decide

for the observer himself and his satisfaction
we may see now that in the judgement of taste

nothing is postulated but such a universal voice

in respect of the satisfaction without the intervention

of concepts and thus the possibility of an aesthetical

judgement that can at the same time be regarded

as valid for every one the judgement of taste itself

does not postulate the agreement of every one for

that can only be done by a logically universal judgement

because it can adduce reasons it only imputes

this agreement to every one as a case of the

rule in respect of which it expects not confirmation

by concepts but assent from others the

universal voice is therefore only an idea we do

not yet inquire upon what it rests it may be

uncertain whether or not the man who believes that

he is laying down a judgement of taste is as a matter

of fact judging in conformity with that idea but

that he refers his judgement thereto and consequently

that it is intended to be a judgement of taste he63

announces by the expression beauty he can

be quite certain of this for himself by the mere

consciousness of the separation of everything belonging

to the pleasant and the good from the

satisfaction which is left and this is all for which he

promises himself the agreement of every onea claim

which would be justifiable under these conditions

provided only he did not often make mistakes and

thus lay down an erroneous judgement of taste
 9 investigation of the question whether in the

judgement of taste the feeling of pleasure precedes

or follows the judging of the object
the solution of this question is the key to the

critique of taste and so is worthy of all attention
if the pleasure in the given object precedes

and it is only its universal communicability that is

to be acknowledged in the judgement of taste about

the representation of the object there would be a

contradiction for such pleasure would be nothing

different from the mere pleasantness in the sensation

and so in accordance with its nature could have only

private validity because it is immediately dependent

on the representation through which the object is

given
hence it is the universal capability of communication

of the mental state in the given representation

which as the subjective condition of

the judgement of taste must be fundamental and

must have the pleasure in the object as its consequent

but nothing can be universally communicated

except cognition and representation so

far as it belongs to cognition for it is only thus

that this latter can be objective and only through64

this has it a universal point of reference with which

the representative power of every one is compelled

to harmonise if the determining ground of our

judgement as to this universal communicability of the

representation is to be merely subjective ie is conceived

independently of any concept of the object

it can be nothing else than the state of mind which

is to be met with in the relation of our representative

powers to each other so far as they refer a given

representation to cognition in general
the cognitive powers which are involved by

this representation are here in free play because

no definite concept limits them to a particular19 rule

of cognition hence the state of mind in this

representation must be a feeling of the free play

of the representative powers in a given representation

with reference to a cognition in general now

a representation by which an object is given

that is to become a cognition in general requires

imagination for the gathering together the manifold

of intuition and understanding for the unity of

the concept uniting the representations this state

of free play of the cognitive faculties in a representation

by which an object is given must be

universally communicable because cognition as

the determination of the object with which given

representations in whatever subject are to agree

is the only kind of representation which is valid

for every one
the subjective universal communicability of the

mode of representation in a judgement of taste

since it is to be possible without presupposing a

definite concept can refer to nothing else than the65

state of mind in the free play of the imagination

and the understanding so far as they agree with

each other as is requisite for cognition in general

we are conscious that this subjective relation

suitable for cognition in general must be valid for

every one and thus must be universally communicable

just as if it were a definite cognition

resting always on that relation as its subjective

condition
this merely subjective aesthetical judging of the

object or of the representation by which it is given

precedes the pleasure in it and is the ground of this

pleasure in the harmony of the cognitive faculties

but on the universality of the subjective conditions

for judging of objects is alone based the universal

subjective validity of the satisfaction bound up by

us with the representation of the object that we call

beautiful
the power of communicating ones state of mind

even though only in respect of the cognitive faculties

carries a pleasure with it as we can easily show from

the natural propension of man towards sociability

empirical and psychological but this is not

enough for our design the pleasure that we feel

is in a judgement of taste necessarily imputed by

us to every one else as if when we call a thing

beautiful it is to be regarded as a characteristic of

the object which is determined in it according to

concepts though beauty without a reference to the

feeling of the subject is nothing by itself but we

must reserve the examination of this question until

we have answered another viz if and how

aesthetical judgements are possible a priori
we now occupy ourselves with the easier question

in what way we are conscious of a mutual subjective66

harmony of the cognitive powers with one another

in the judgement of taste is it aesthetically by mere

internal sense and sensation or is it intellectually

by the consciousness of our designed activity by

which we bring them into play
if the given representation which occasions the

judgement of taste were a concept uniting understanding

and imagination in the judging of the

object into a cognition of the object the consciousness

of this relation would be intellectual as in the

objective schematism of the judgement of which

the critique20 treats but then the judgement

would not be laid down in reference to pleasure and

pain and consequently would not be a judgement of

taste but the judgement of taste independently

of concepts determines the object in respect of

satisfaction and of the predicate of beauty therefore

that subjective unity of relation can only make

itself known by means of sensation the excitement

of both faculties imagination and understanding

to indeterminate but yet through the stimulus of

the given sensation harmonious activity viz that

which belongs to cognition in general is the sensation

whose universal communicability is postulated

by the judgement of taste an objective relation

can only be thought but yet so far as it is subjective

according to its conditions can be felt in its effect

on the mind and of a relation based on no concept

like the relation of the representative powers to a

cognitive faculty in general no other consciousness

is possible than that through the sensation of the

effect which consists in the more lively play of both

mental powers the imagination and the understanding

when animated by mutual agreement a67

representation which as singular and apart from comparison

with others yet has an agreement with the

conditions of universality which it is the business of

the understanding to supply brings the cognitive

faculties into that proportionate accord which we

require for all cognition and so regard as holding

for every one who is determined to judge by means

of understanding and sense in combination ie for

every man
explanation of the beautiful resulting from

the second moment
the beautiful is that which pleases universally

without a concept


third moment
of judgements of taste according to the

relation of the purposes which are

brought into consideration therein
 10 of purposiveness in general
if we wish to explain what a purpose is according

to its transcendental determinations without

presupposing anything empirical like the feeling of

pleasure we say that the purpose is the object of

a concept in so far as the concept is regarded as

the cause of the object the real ground of its

possibility and the causality of a concept in respect

of its object is its purposiveness forma finalis

where then not merely the cognition of an object

but the object itself its form and existence is

thought as an effect only possible by means of the

concept of this latter there we think a purpose68

the representation of the effect is here the determining

ground of its cause and precedes it the

consciousness of the causality of a representation for

maintaining the subject in the same state may here

generally denote what we call pleasure while on

the other hand pain is that representation which

contains the ground of the determination of the

state of representations into their opposite of

restraining or removing them21
the faculty of desire so far as it is determinable

only through concepts ie to act in conformity with

the representation of a purpose would be the will

but an object or a state of mind or even an action

is called purposive although its possibility does not

necessarily presuppose the representation of a purpose

merely because its possibility can be explained

and conceived by us only so far as we assume for its

ground a causality according to purposes ie a will

which would have so disposed it according to the

representation of a certain rule there can be then

purposiveness without22 purpose so far as we do not

place the causes of this form in a will but yet can

only make the explanation of its possibility intelligible

to ourselves by deriving it from a will

again we are not always forced to regard what we

observe in respect of its possibility from the point

of view of reason thus we can at least observe a

purposiveness according to form without basing it

on a purpose as the material of the nexus finalis69

and we can notice it in objects although only by

reflection
 11 the judgement of taste has nothing at its

basis but the form of the purposiveness of an

object or of its mode of representation
every purpose if it be regarded as a ground of

satisfaction always carries with it an interestas

the determining ground of the judgementabout

the object of pleasure therefore no subjective

purpose can lie at the basis of the judgement of

taste but neither can the judgement of taste be

determined by any representation of an objective

purpose ie of the possibility of the object itself in

accordance with principles of purposive combination

and consequently it can be determined by no concept

of the good because it is an aesthetical and

not a cognitive judgement it therefore has to do

with no concept of the character and internal or

external possibility of the object by means of this

or that cause but merely with the relation of the

representative powers to one another so far as they

are determined by a representation
now this relation in the determination of an

object as beautiful is bound up with the feeling of

pleasure which is declared by the judgement of taste

to be valid for every one hence a pleasantness

accompanying the representation can as little contain

the determining ground of the judgement as

the representation of the perfection of the object and

the concept of the good can therefore it can be

nothing else than the subjective purposiveness in the

representation of an object without any purpose

either objective or subjective and thus it is the70

mere form of purposiveness in the representation by

which an object is given to us so far as we are

conscious of it which constitutes the satisfaction

that we without a concept judge to be universally

communicable and consequently this is the determining

ground of the judgement of taste
 12 the judgement of taste rests on a priori

grounds
to establish a priori the connexion of the

feeling of a pleasure or pain as an effect with any

representation whatever sensation or concept as its

cause is absolutely impossible for that would be a

particular23 causal relation which with objects of

experience can always only be cognised a posteriori

and through the medium of experience itself we

actually have indeed in the critique of practical

reason derived from universal moral concepts

a priori the feeling of respect as a special and

peculiar modification of feeling which will not

strictly correspond either to the pleasure or the

pain that we get from empirical objects but

there we could go beyond the bounds of experience

and call in a causality which rested on a supersensible

attribute of the subject viz freedom and

even there properly speaking it was not this feeling

which we derived from the idea of the moral as

cause but merely the determination of the will

but the state of mind which accompanies any

determination of the will is in itself a feeling of

pleasure and identical with it and therefore does

not follow from it as its effect this last must only

be assumed if the concept of the moral as a good71

precede the determination of the will by the law for

in that case the pleasure that is bound up with the

concept could not be derived from it as from a mere

cognition
now the case is similar with the pleasure in

aesthetical judgements only that here it is merely

contemplative and does not bring about an interest

in the object which on the other hand in the moral

judgement it is practical24 the consciousness of the

mere formal purposiveness in the play of the subjects

cognitive powers in a representation through which

an object is given is the pleasure itself because it

contains a determining ground of the activity of the

subject in respect of the excitement of its cognitive

powers and therefore an inner causality which is

purposive in respect of cognition in general without

however being limited to any definite cognition and

consequently contains a mere form of the subjective

purposiveness of a representation in an aesthetical

judgement this pleasure is in no way practical

neither like that arising from the pathological

ground of pleasantness nor that from the intellectual

ground of the represented good but yet it involves

causality viz of maintaining the state of the representation

itself and the exercise of the cognitive

powers without further design we linger over the

contemplation of the beautiful because this contemplation

strengthens and reproduces itself which72

is analogous to though not of the same kind as

that lingering which takes place when a physical

charm in the representation of the object repeatedly

arouses the attention the mind being passive
 13 the pure judgement of taste is independent

of charm and emotion
every interest spoils the judgement of taste and

takes from its impartiality especially if the purposiveness

is not as with the interest of reason

placed before the feeling of pleasure but grounded

on it this last always happens in an aesthetical

judgement upon anything so far as it gratifies or

grieves us hence judgements so affected can lay

no claim at all to a universally valid satisfaction or

at least so much the less claim in proportion as

there are sensations of this sort among the determining

grounds of taste that taste is still

barbaric which needs a mixture of charms and

emotions in order that there may be satisfaction and

still more so if it make these the measure of its

assent
nevertheless charms are often not only taken

account of in the case of beauty which properly

speaking ought merely to be concerned with form as

contributory to the aesthetical universal satisfaction

but they are passed off as in themselves beauties

and thus the matter of satisfaction is substituted for

the form this misconception however like so

many others which have something true at their

basis may be removed by a careful definition of

these concepts
a judgement of taste on which charm and emotion

have no influence although they may be bound up73

with the satisfaction in the beautifulwhich therefore

has as its determining ground merely the purposiveness

of the formis a pure judgement of taste
 14 elucidation by means of examples
aesthetical judgements can be divided just like

theoretical logical judgements into empirical and

pure the first assert pleasantness or unpleasantness

the second assert the beauty of an object or

of the manner of representing it the former are

judgements of sense material aesthetical judgements

the latter as formal25 are alone strictly

judgements of taste
a judgement of taste is therefore pure only so

far as no merely empirical satisfaction is mingled

with its determining ground but this always

happens if charm or emotion have any share in the

judgement by which anything is to be described as

beautiful
now here many objections present themselves

which fallaciously put forward charm not merely as

a necessary ingredient of beauty but as alone

sufficient to justify a things being called beautiful

a mere colour eg the green of a grass plot a mere

tone as distinguished from sound and noise like

that of a violin are by most people described as

beautiful in themselves although both seem to have

at their basis merely the matter of representations

viz simply sensation and therefore only deserve to

be called pleasant but we must at the same time

remark that the sensations of colours and of tone

have a right to be regarded as beautiful only in so

far as they are pure this is a determination which74

concerns their form and is the only element of

these representations which admits with certainty of

universal communicability for we cannot assume

that the quality of sensations is the same in all

subjects and we can hardly say that the pleasantness

of one colour or the tone of one musical instrument

is judged preferable to that of another in the same26

way by every one
if we assume with euler that colours are isochronous

vibrations pulsus of the aether as sounds

are of the air in a state of disturbance andwhat

is most importantthat the mind not only perceives

by sense the effect of these in exciting the

organ but also perceives by reflection the regular

play of impressions and thus the form of the combination

of different representations which i still

do not doubt27then colours and tone cannot be

reckoned as mere sensations but as the formal

determination of the unity of a manifold of sensations

and thus as beauties in themselves
but pure in a simple mode of sensation means

that its uniformity is troubled and interrupted by no

foreign sensation and it belongs merely to the form

because here we can abstract from the quality of

that mode of sensation abstract from the colours

and tone if any which it represents hence all

simple colours so far as they are pure are regarded

as beautiful composite colours have not this advantage

because as they are not simple we have no

standard for judging whether they should be called

pure or not
but as regards the beauty attributed to the75

object on account of its form to suppose it to be

capable of augmentation through the charm of the

object is a common error and one very prejudicial

to genuine uncorrupted wellfounded taste we

can doubtless add these charms to beauty in order

to interest the mind by the representation of the

object apart from the bare satisfaction received

and thus they may serve as a recommendation of

taste and its cultivation especially when it is yet

crude and unexercised but they actually do injury

to the judgement of taste if they draw attention to

themselves as the grounds for judging of beauty so

far are they from adding to beauty that they must

only be admitted by indulgence as aliens and provided

always that they do not disturb the beautiful

form in cases when taste is yet weak and untrained
in painting sculpture and in all the formative

artsin architecture and horticulture so far as they

are beautiful artsthe delineation is the essential

thing and here it is not what gratifies in sensation

but what pleases by means of its form that is fundamental

for taste the colours which light up the

sketch belong to the charm they may indeed enliven28

the object for sensation but they cannot make

it worthy of contemplation and beautiful in most

cases they are rather limited by the requirements of

the beautiful form and even where charm is permissible

it is ennobled solely by this
every form of the objects of sense both of

external sense and also mediately of internal is

either figure or play in the latter case it is either

play of figures in space viz pantomime and

dancing or the mere play of sensations in time

the charm of colours or of the pleasant tones of an76

instrument may be added but the delineation in the

first case and the composition in the second constitute

the proper object of the pure judgement of taste

to say that the purity of colours and of tones or

their variety and contrast seems to add to beauty

does not mean that they supply a homogeneous

addition to our satisfaction in the form because they

are pleasant in themselves but they do so because

they make the form more exactly definitely and

completely intuitible and besides by their charm

excite the representation whilst they29 awaken and

fix our attention on the object itself
even what we call ornaments parerga29 ie

those things which do not belong to the complete

representation of the object internally as elements

but only externally as complements and which

augment the satisfaction of taste do so only by their

form as for example the frames of pictures29 or

the draperies of statues or the colonnades of palaces

but if the ornament does not itself consist in beautiful

form and if it is used as a golden frame is used

merely to recommend the painting by its charm it

is then called finery and injures genuine beauty
emotion ie a sensation in which pleasantness

is produced by means of a momentary checking and

a consequent more powerful outflow of the vital

force does not belong at all to beauty but

sublimity with which the feeling of emotion is

bound up29 requires a different standard of judgement

from that which is at the foundation of taste

and thus a pure judgement of taste has for its determining

ground neither charm nor emotion in a

word no sensation as the material of the aesthetical

judgement
77
 15 the judgement of taste is quite independent

of the concept of perfection
objective purposiveness can only be cognised by

means of the reference of the manifold to a definite

purpose and therefore only through a concept

from this alone it is plain that the beautiful the

judging of which has at its basis a merely formal

purposiveness ie a purposiveness without purpose

is quite independent of the concept of the good

because the latter presupposes an objective purposiveness

ie the reference of the object to a

definite purpose
objective purposiveness is either external ie

the utility or internal ie the perfection of the

object that the satisfaction in an object on

account of which we call it beautiful cannot rest

on the representation of its utility is sufficiently

obvious from the two preceding sections because

in that case it would not be an immediate satisfaction

in the object which is the essential condition

of a judgement about beauty but objective internal

purposiveness ie perfection comes nearer to the

predicate of beauty and it has been regarded by

celebrated philosophers30 as the same as beauty

with the proviso if it is thought in a confused way

it is of the greatest importance in a critique of taste

to decide whether beauty can thus actually be

resolved into the concept of perfection
to judge of objective purposiveness we always78

need not only the concept of a purpose but if that

purposiveness is not to be external utility but

internal the concept of an internal purpose which

shall contain the ground of the internal possibility

of the object now as a purpose in general is that

whose concept can be regarded as the ground of the

possibility of the object itself so in order to

represent objective purposiveness in a thing the

concept of what sort of thing it is to be must come

first the agreement of the manifold in it with

this concept which furnishes the rule for combining

the manifold is the qualitative perfection of the

thing quite different from this is quantitative perfection

the completeness of a thing after its kind

which is a mere concept of magnitude of totality31

in this what the thing ought to be is conceived as

already determined and it is only asked if it has

all its requisites the formal element in the representation

of a thing ie the agreement of the manifold

with a unity it being undetermined what this ought

to be gives to cognition no objective purposiveness

whatever for since abstraction is made of this

unity as purpose what the thing ought to be

nothing remains but the subjective purposiveness

of the representations in the mind of the intuiting

subject and this although it furnishes a certain

purposiveness of the representative state of the

subject and so a facility of apprehending a given79

form by the imagination yet furnishes no perfection

of an object since the object is not here conceived

by means of the concept of a purpose for example

if in a forest i come across a plot of sward round

which trees stand in a circle and do not then represent

to myself a purpose viz that it is intended to serve

for country dances not the least concept of perfection

is furnished by the mere form but to

represent to oneself a formal objective purposiveness

without purpose ie the mere form of a perfection

without any matter and without the concept of that

with which it is accordant even if it were merely

the idea of conformity to law in general32 is a

veritable contradiction
now the judgement of taste is an aesthetical

judgement ie such as rests on subjective grounds

the determining ground of which cannot be a concept

and consequently cannot be the concept of a

definite purpose therefore in beauty regarded

as a formal subjective purposiveness there is in no

way thought a perfection of the object as a wouldbe

formal purposiveness which yet is objective

and thus to distinguish between the concepts of

the beautiful and the good as if they were only

different in logical form the first being a confused

the second a clear concept of perfection but

identical in content and origin is quite fallacious

for then there would be no specific difference

between them but a judgement of taste would be

as much a cognitive judgement as the judgement by

which a thing is described as good just as when

the ordinary man says that fraud is unjust he bases

his judgement on confused grounds whilst the80

philosopher bases it on clear grounds but both on

identical principles of reason i have already

however said that an aesthetical judgement is unique

of its kind and gives absolutely no cognition not

even a confused cognition of the object this is only

supplied by a logical judgement on the contrary

it simply refers the representation by which an

object is given to the subject and brings to our

notice no characteristic of the object but only the

purposive form in the determination of the representative

powers which are occupying themselves

therewith the judgement is called aesthetical just

because its determining ground is not a concept

but the feeling of internal sense of that harmony in

the play of the mental powers so far as it can be felt

in sensation on the other hand if we wish to call

confused concepts and the objective judgement based

on them aesthetical we shall have an understanding

judging sensibly or a sense representing its

objects by means of concepts both of which are

contradictory33 the faculty of concepts be they

confused or clear is the understanding and although

understanding has to do with the judgement

of taste as an aesthetical judgement as it has with all

judgements yet it has to do with it not as a faculty

by which an object is cognised but as the faculty

which determines the judgement and its representation

without any concept in accordance with its

relation to the subject and the subjects internal

feeling in so far as this judgement may be possible

in accordance with a universal rule
81
 16 the judgement of taste by which an object is

declared to be beautiful under the condition of a

definite concept is not pure
there are two kinds of beauty free beauty

pulchritudo vaga or merely dependent beauty

pulchritudo adhaerens the first presupposes no

concept of what the object ought to be the second

does presuppose such a concept and the perfection

of the object in accordance therewith the first is

called the selfsubsistent beauty of this or that

thing the second as dependent upon a concept

conditioned beauty is ascribed to objects which

come under the concept of a particular purpose
flowers are free natural beauties hardly any

one but a botanist knows what sort of a thing a

flower ought to be and even he though recognising

in the flower the reproductive organ of the

plant pays no regard to this natural purpose if

he is passing judgement on the flower by taste

there is then at the basis of this judgement no

perfection of any kind no internal purposiveness

to which the collection of the manifold is referred

many birds such as the parrot the humming bird

the bird of paradise and many sea shells are

beauties in themselves which do not belong to any

object determined in respect of its purpose by

concepts but please freely and in themselves so

also delineations  la grecque foliage for borders

or wallpapers mean nothing in themselves they

represent nothingno object under a definite

conceptand are free beauties we can refer to

the same class what are called in music phantasies

ie pieces without any theme and in fact all music

without words
82

in the judging of a free beauty according to the

mere form the judgement of taste is pure there

is presupposed no concept of any purpose for which

the manifold should serve the given object and

which therefore is to be represented therein by

such a concept the freedom of the imagination which

disports itself in the contemplation of the figure

would be only limited
but human beauty ie of a man a woman or

a child the beauty of a horse or a building be

it church palace arsenal or summerhouse presupposes

a concept of the purpose which determines

what the thing is to be and consequently a concept

of its perfection it is therefore adherent beauty

now as the combination of the pleasant in sensation

with beauty which properly is only concerned with

form is a hindrance to the purity of the judgement

of taste so also is its purity injured by the combination

with beauty of the good viz that manifold

which is good for the thing itself in accordance

with its purpose
we could add much to a building which would

immediately please the eye if only it were not to

be a church we could adorn a figure with all

kinds of spirals and light but regular lines as the

new zealanders do with their tattooing if only it

were not the figure of a human being and again

this could have much finer features and a more

pleasing and gentle cast of countenance provided

it were not intended to represent a man much less

a warrior
now the satisfaction in the manifold of a thing

in reference to the internal purpose which determines

its possibility is a satisfaction grounded on a concept

but the satisfaction in beauty is such as presupposes83

no concept but is immediately bound up with the

representation through which the object is given

not through which it is thought if now the judgement

of taste in respect of the beauty of a thing is

made dependent on the purpose in its manifold like

a judgement of reason and thus limited it is no

longer a free and pure judgement of taste
it is true that taste gains by this combination of

aesthetical with intellectual satisfaction inasmuch as

it becomes fixed and though it is not universal yet

in respect to certain purposively determined objects

it becomes possible to prescribe rules for it these

however are not rules of taste but merely rules for

the unification of taste with reason ie of the

beautiful with the good by which the former

becomes available as an instrument of design in

respect of the latter thus the tone of mind which

is selfmaintaining and of subjective universal validity

is subordinated to the way of thinking which can be

maintained only by painful resolve but is of objective

universal validity properly speaking however perfection

gains nothing by beauty or beauty by perfection

but when we compare the representation

by which an object is given to us with the object

as regards what it ought to be by means of a

concept we cannot avoid considering along with it

the sensation in the subject and thus when both

states of mind are in harmony our whole faculty of

representative power gains
a judgement of taste then in respect of an object

with a definite internal purpose can only be pure

if either the person judging has no concept of this

purpose or else abstracts from it in his judgement

such a person although forming an accurate judgement

of taste in judging of the object as free beauty84

would yet by another who considers the beauty in

it only as a dependent attribute who looks to the

purpose of the object be blamed and accused of

false taste although both are right in their own

way the one in reference to what he has before

his eyes the other in reference to what he has in

his thought by means of this distinction we can

settle many disputes about beauty between judges

of taste by showing that the one is speaking of

free the other of dependent beautythat the first

is making a pure the second an applied judgement

of taste
 17 of the ideal of beauty
there can be no objective rule of taste which

shall determine by means of concepts what is

beautiful for every judgement from this source

is aesthetical ie the feeling of the subject and not

a concept of the object is its determining ground

to seek for a principle of taste which shall furnish

by means of definite concepts a universal criterion

of the beautiful is fruitless trouble because what

is sought is impossible and selfcontradictory the

universal communicability of sensation satisfaction

or dissatisfaction without the aid of a conceptthe

agreement as far as is possible of all times and

peoples as regards this feeling in the representation

of certain objectsthis is the empirical criterion

although weak and hardly sufficing for probability

of the derivation of a taste thus confirmed by

examples from the deeplying grounds of agreement

common to all men in judging of the forms under

which objects are given to them
hence we consider some products of taste as

exemplary not that taste can be acquired by85

imitating others for it must be an original faculty

he who imitates a model shows no doubt in so

far as he attains to it skill but only shows taste

in so far as he can judge of this model itself34 it

follows from hence that the highest model the

archetype of taste is a mere idea which every one

must produce in himself and according to which

he must judge every object of taste every example

of judgement by taste and even the taste of every

one idea properly means a rational concept and

ideal the representation of an individual being

regarded as adequate to an idea35 hence that

archetype of taste which certainly rests on the

indeterminate idea that reason has of a maximum

but which cannot be represented by concepts but

only in an individual presentation is better called

the ideal of the beautiful although we are not

in possession of this we yet strive to produce

it in ourselves but it can only be an ideal of

the imagination because it rests on a presentation

and not on concepts and the imagination is the

faculty of presentationhow do we arrive at such

an ideal of beauty a priori or empirically

moreover what species of the beautiful is susceptible

of an ideal
first it is well to remark that the beauty for86

which an ideal is to be sought cannot be vague

beauty but is fixed by a concept of objective

purposiveness and thus it cannot appertain to the

object of a quite pure judgement of taste but to

that of a judgement of taste which is in part intellectual

that is in whatever grounds of judgement

an ideal is to be found an idea of reason

in accordance with definite concepts must lie at

its basis which determines a priori the purpose

on which the internal possibility of the object rests

an ideal of beautiful flowers of a beautiful piece

of furniture of a beautiful view is inconceivable

but neither can an ideal be represented of a beauty

dependent on definite purposes eg of a beautiful

dwellinghouse a beautiful tree a beautiful garden

etc presumably because their purpose is not

sufficiently determined and fixed by the concept

and thus the purposiveness is nearly as free as

in the case of vague beauty the only being which

has the purpose of its existence in itself is man who

can determine his purposes by reason or where

he must receive them from external perception yet

can compare them with essential and universal

purposes and can judge this their accordance

aesthetically this man is then alone of all objects

in the world susceptible of an ideal of beauty as

it is only humanity in his person as an intelligence

that is susceptible of the ideal of perfection
but there are here two elements first there

is the aesthetical normal idea which is an individual

intuition of the imagination representing the

standard of our judgement upon man as a thing

belonging to a particular animal species secondly

there is the rational idea which makes the purposes

of humanity so far as they cannot be sensibly87

represented the principle for judging of a figure

through which as their phenomenal effect those

purposes are revealed the normal idea of the

figure of an animal of a particular race must take

its elements from experience but the greatest

purposiveness in the construction of the figure

that would be available for the universal standard

of aesthetical judgement upon each individual of this

speciesthe image which is as it were designedly

at the basis of natures technic to which only

the whole race and not any isolated individual is

adequatethis lies merely in the idea of the

judging subject and this with its proportions

as an aesthetical idea can be completely presented

in concreto in a model in order to make intelligible

in some measure for who can extract her whole

secret from nature how this comes to pass we

shall attempt a psychological explanation
we must remark that in a way quite incomprehensible

by us the imagination can not only recall

on occasion the signs for concepts long past

but can also reproduce the image of the figure

of the object out of an unspeakable number of

objects of different kinds or even of the same kind

further if the mind is concerned with comparisons

the imagination can in all probability actually

though unconsciously let one image glide into

another and thus by the concurrence of several of

the same kind come by an average which serves as

the common measure of all every one has seen

a thousand fullgrown men now if you wish

to judge of their normal size estimating it by means

of comparison the imagination as i think allows

a great number of images perhaps the whole

thousand to fall on one another if i am allowed88

to apply here the analogy of optical presentation

it is in the space where most of them are combined

and inside the contour where the place is illuminated

with the most vivid colours that the average

size is cognisable which both in height and

breadth is equally far removed from the extreme

bounds of the greatest and smallest stature and

this is the stature of a beautiful man we could

arrive at the same thing mechanically by adding

together all thousand magnitudes heights breadths

and thicknesses and dividing the sum by a thousand

but the imagination does this by means

of a dynamical effect which arises from the various

impressions of such figures on the organ of internal

sense if now in a similar way for this average

man we seek the average head for this head

the average nose etc such figure is at the basis

of the normal idea in the country where the

comparison is instituted thus necessarily under

these empirical conditions a negro must have a

different normal idea of the beauty of the human

figure from a white man a chinaman a different

normal idea from a european etc and the same

is the case with the model of a beautiful horse or

dog of a certain breedthis normal idea is not

derived from proportions got from experience and

regarded as definite rules but in accordance with

it rules for judging become in the first instance

possible it is the image for the whole race which

floats among all the variously different intuitions of

individuals which nature takes as archetype in her

productions of the same species but which seems

not to be fully reached in any individual case it

is by no means the whole archetype of beauty in

the race but only the form constituting the indispensable89

condition of all beauty and thus merely

correctness in the mental presentation of the race

it is like the celebrated doryphorus of polycletus36

the rule myrons37 cow might also be used thus for

its kind it can therefore contain nothing specifically

characteristic for otherwise it would not be

the normal idea for the race its presentation

pleases not by its beauty but merely because it

contradicts no condition under which alone a thing

of this kind can be beautiful the presentation is

merely correct38
we must yet distinguish the normal idea of the

beautiful from the ideal which latter on grounds

already alleged we can only expect in the human

figure in this the ideal consists in the expression

of the moral without which the object would not

please universally and thus positively not merely

negatively in a correct presentation the visible

expression of moral ideas that rule men inwardly90

can indeed only be got from experience but to

make its connexion with all which our reason

unites with the morally good in the idea of the

highest purposivenessgoodness of heart purity

strength peace etcvisible as it were in bodily

manifestation as the effect of that which is internal

requires a union of pure ideas of reason with

great imaginative power even in him who wishes

to judge of it still more in him who wishes to

present it the correctness of such an ideal of

beauty is shown by its permitting no sensible charm

to mingle with the satisfaction in the object and yet

allowing us to take a great interest therein this

shows that a judgement in accordance with such a

standard can never be purely aesthetical and that a

judgement in accordance with an ideal of beauty is

not a mere judgement of taste
 explanation of the beautiful

derived from this third moment
beauty is the form of the purposiveness of an

object so far as this is perceived in it without any

representation of a purpose39

91

fourth moment
of the judgement of taste according to the

modality of the satisfaction in the object
 18 what the modality in a judgement of

taste is
i can say of every representation that it is at least

possible that as a cognition it should be bound

up with a pleasure of a representation that i

call pleasant i say that it actually excites pleasure

in me but the beautiful we think as having a

necessary reference to satisfaction now this necessity

is of a peculiar kind it is not a theoretical

objective necessity in which case it would be

cognised a priori that every one will feel this satisfaction

in the object called beautiful by me it is

not a practical necessity in which case by concepts

of a pure rational will serving as a rule for

freely acting beings the satisfaction is the necessary

result of an objective law and only indicates that we

absolutely without any further design ought to

act in a certain way but the necessity which is

thought in an aesthetical judgement can only be called

exemplary ie a necessity of the assent of all to a

judgement which is regarded as the example of a

universal rule that we cannot state since an aesthetical

judgement is not an objective cognitive judgement

this necessity cannot be derived from definite

concepts and is therefore not apodictic still less

can it be inferred from the universality of experience

of a complete agreement of judgements as to the

beauty of a certain object for not only would

experience hardly furnish sufficiently numerous92

vouchers for this but also on empirical judgements

we can base no concept of the necessity of these

judgements
 19 the subjective necessity which we ascribe

to the judgement of taste is conditioned
the judgement of taste requires the agreement

of every one and he who describes anything as

beautiful claims that every one ought to give his

approval to the object in question and also describe

it as beautiful the ought in the aesthetical judgement

is therefore pronounced in accordance with all the

data which are required for judging and yet is only

conditioned we ask for the agreement of every

one else because we have for it a ground that is

common to all and we could count on this agreement

provided we were always sure that the case

was correctly subsumed under that ground as rule

of assent
 20 the condition of necessity which a judgement

of taste asserts is the idea of a common sense
if judgements of taste like cognitive judgements

had a definite objective principle then the person

who lays them down in accordance with this latter

would claim an unconditioned necessity for his judgement

if they were devoid of all principle like those

of the mere taste of sense we would not allow them

in thought any necessity whatever hence they

must have a subjective principle which determines

what pleases or displeases only by feeling and not

by concepts but yet with universal validity but

such a principle could only be regarded as a common

sense which is essentially different from common93

understanding which people sometimes call common

sense sensus communis for the latter does not

judge by feeling but always by concepts although

ordinarily only as by obscurely represented principles
hence it is only under the presupposition that

there is a common sense by which we do not

understand an external sense but the effect resulting

from the free play of our cognitive powersit is

only under this presupposition i say that the judgement

of taste can be laid down
 21 have we ground for presupposing a common

sense
cognitions and judgements must along with the

conviction that accompanies them admit of universal

communicability for otherwise there would be no

harmony between them and the object and they

would be collectively a mere subjective play of the

representative powers exactly as scepticism would

have it but if cognitions are to admit of communicability

so must also the state of mindie

the accordance of the cognitive powers with a cognition

generally and that proportion of them which

is suitable for a representation by which an object

is given to us in order that a cognition may be

made out of itadmit of universal communicability

for without this as the subjective condition of

cognition knowledge as an effect could not arise

this actually always takes place when a given

object by means of sense excites the imagination

to collect the manifold and the imagination in its

turn excites the understanding to bring about a

unity of this collective process in concepts but

this accordance of the cognitive powers has a94

different proportion according to the variety of the

objects which are given however it must be

such that this internal relation by which one mental

faculty is excited by another shall be generally

the most beneficial for both faculties in respect of

cognition of given objects and this accordance

can only be determined by feeling not according to

concepts since now this accordance itself must

admit of universal communicability and consequently

also our feeling of it in a given representation and

since the universal communicability of a feeling

presupposes a common sense we have grounds for

assuming this latter and this common sense is

assumed without relying on psychological observations

but simply as the necessary condition of the

universal communicability of our knowledge which

is presupposed in every logic and in every principle

of knowledge that is not sceptical
 22 the necessity of the universal agreement that

is thought in a judgement of taste is a subjective

necessity which is represented as objective under

the presupposition of a common sense
in all judgements by which we describe anything

as beautiful we allow no one to be of another

opinion without however grounding our judgement

on concepts but only on our feeling which we therefore

place at its basis not as a private but as a

communal feeling40 now this common sense cannot

be grounded on experience for it aims at justifying

judgements which contain an ought it does not

say that every one will agree with my judgement

but that he ought and so common sense as an95

example of whose judgement i here put forward my

judgement of taste and on account of which i attribute

to the latter an exemplary validity is a mere

ideal norm under the supposition of which i have a

right to make into a rule for every one a judgement

that accords therewith as well as the satisfaction in

an object expressed in such judgement for the

principle which concerns the agreement of different

judging persons although only subjective is yet

assumed as subjectively universal an idea necessary

for every one and thus can claim universal assent

as if it were objective provided we are sure

that we have correctly subsumed the particulars

under it
this indeterminate norm of a common sense is

actually presupposed by us as is shown by our

claim to lay down judgements of taste whether

there is in fact such a common sense as a constitutive

principle of the possibility of experience or

whether a yet higher principle of reason makes

it only into a regulative principle for producing in

us a common sense for higher purposes whether

therefore taste is an original and natural faculty

or only the idea of an artificial one yet to be

acquired so that a judgement of taste with its

assumption of a universal assent in fact is only a

requirement of reason for producing such harmony

of sentiment whether the ought ie the objective

necessity of the confluence of the feeling of any one

man with that of every other only signifies the

possibility of arriving at this accord and the judgement

of taste only affords an example of the application

of this principle these questions we have

neither the wish nor the power to investigate as

yet we have now only to resolve the faculty of taste96

into its elements in order to unite them at last in the

idea of a common sense
 explanation of the beautiful resulting from

the fourth moment
the beautiful is that which without any concept

is cognised as the object of a necessary satisfaction
general remark on the first section of the analytic
if we seek the result of the preceding analysis

we find that everything runs up into this concept of

taste that it is a faculty for judging an object in

reference to the imaginations free conformity to law

now if in the judgement of taste the imagination must

be considered in its freedom it is in the first place

not regarded as reproductive as it is subject to the

laws of association but as productive and spontaneous

as the author of arbitrary forms of possible intuition

and although in the apprehension of a

given object of sense it is tied to a definite form of

this object and so far has no free play such as that

of poetry yet it may readily be conceived that the

object can furnish it with such a form containing a

collection of the manifold as the imagination itself

if it were left free would project in accordance with

the conformity to law of the understanding in

general but that the imaginative power should be

free and yet of itself conformed to law ie bringing

autonomy with it is a contradiction the understanding

alone gives the law if however the

imagination is compelled to proceed according to a

definite law its product in respect of form is determined

by concepts as to what it ought to be but97

then as is above shown the satisfaction is not that

in the beautiful but in the good in perfection at

any rate in mere formal perfection and the judgement

is not a judgement of taste hence it is a

conformity to law without a law and a subjective

agreement of the imagination and understandingwithout

such an objective agreement as there is

when the representation is referred to a definite

concept of an objectcan subsist along with the free

conformity to law of the understanding which is

also called purposiveness without purpose and with

the peculiar feature of a judgement of taste
now geometrically regular figures such as a

circle a square a cube etc are commonly adduced

by critics of taste as the simplest and most indisputable

examples of beauty and yet they are called

regular because we can only represent them by

regarding them as mere presentations of a definite

concept which prescribes the rule for the figure

according to which alone it is possible one of

these two must be wrong either that judgement of

the critic which ascribes beauty to the said figures

or ours which regards purposiveness apart from a

concept as requisite for beauty
hardly any one will say that a man must have taste

in order that he should find more satisfaction in a

circle than in a scrawled outline in an equilateral and

equiangular quadrilateral than in one which is oblique

irregular and as it were deformed for this belongs to

the ordinary understanding and is not taste at all

where eg our design is to judge of the size of an

area or to make intelligible the relation of the parts

of it when divided to one another and to the whole

then regular figures and those of the simplest kind are

needed and the satisfaction does not rest immediately98

on the aspect of the figure but on its availability for

all kinds of possible designs a room whose walls

form oblique angles or a parterre of this kind even

every violation of symmetry in the figure of animals

eg being oneeyed of buildings or of flower beds

displeases because it contradicts the purpose of the

thing not only practically in respect of a definite

use of it but also when we pass judgement on it as

regards any possible design this is not the case

in the judgement of taste which when pure combines

satisfaction or dissatisfactionwithout any

reference to its use or to a purposewith the mere

consideration of the object
the regularity which leads to the concept of an

object is indeed the indispensable condition conditio

sine qua non for grasping the object in a single

representation and determining the manifold in its

form this determination is a purpose in respect of

cognition and in reference to this it is always bound

up with satisfaction which accompanies the execution

of every even problematical design there is

here however merely the approval of the solution

satisfying a problem and not a free and indefinite

purposive entertainment of the mental powers with

what we call beautiful where the understanding is

at the service of imagination and not vice versa
in a thing that is only possible by means of designa

building or even an animalthe regularity

consisting in symmetry must express the unity

of the intuition that accompanies the concept of

purpose and this regularity belongs to cognition

but where only a free play of the representative

powers under the condition however that the

understanding is to suffer no shock thereby is to

be kept up in pleasure gardens room decorations99

all kinds of tasteful furniture etc regularity that

shows constraint is avoided as much as possible

thus in the english taste in gardens or in bizarre

taste in furniture the freedom of the imagination is

pushed almost near to the grotesque and in this

separation from every constraint of rule we have the

case where taste can display its greatest perfection

in the enterprises of the imagination
all stiff regularity such as approximates to

mathematical regularity has something in it repugnant

to taste for our entertainment in the

contemplation of it lasts for no length of time

but it rather in so far as it has not expressly in

view cognition or a definite practical purpose produces

weariness on the other hand that with

which imagination can play in an unstudied and

purposive manner is always new to us and one

does not get tired of looking at it marsden in

his description of sumatra makes the remark that

the free beauties of nature surround the spectator

everywhere and thus lose their attraction for him41

on the other hand a peppergarden where the stakes

on which this plant twines itself form parallel rows

had much attractiveness for him if he met with it

in the middle of a forest and hence he infers that

wild beauty apparently irregular only pleases as a

variation from the regular beauty of which one has

seen enough but he need only have made the

experiment of spending one day in a peppergarden

to have been convinced that once the understanding

by the aid of this regularity has put itself in accord

with the order that it always needs the object will

not entertain for longnay rather it will impose a100

burdensome constraint upon the imagination on

the other hand nature which there is prodigal in its

variety even to luxuriance that is subjected to no

constraint of artificial rules can supply constant food

for tasteeven the song of birds which we can

bring under no musical rule seems to have more

freedom and therefore more for taste than a song of

a human being which is produced in accordance with

all the rules of music for we very much sooner weary

of the latter if it is repeated often and at length

here however we probably confuse our participation

in the mirth of a little creature that we love

with the beauty of its song for if this were exactly

imitated by man as sometimes the notes of the

nightingale are42 it would seem to our ear quite

devoid of taste
again beautiful objects are to be distinguished

from beautiful views of objects which often on

account of their distance cannot be clearly recognised

in the latter case taste appears not

so much in what the imagination apprehends in

this field as in the impulse it thus gets to fiction

ie in the peculiar fancies with which the mind

entertains itself whilst it is continually being aroused

by the variety which strikes the eye an illustration

is afforded eg by the sight of the changing

shapes of a fire on the hearth or of a rippling brook

neither of these has beauty but they bring with

them a charm for the imagination because they

entertain it in free play

101

 second book
analytic of the sublime
 23 transition from the faculty which judges of

the beautiful to that which judges of the sublime
the beautiful and the sublime agree in this

that both please in themselves further neither

presupposes a judgement of sense nor a judgement

logically determined but a judgement of reflection

consequently the satisfaction belonging to them

does not depend on a sensation as in the case of

the pleasant nor on a definite concept as in the

case of the good but it is nevertheless referred to

concepts although indeterminate ones and so the

satisfaction is connected with the mere presentation

of the object or with the faculty of presentation

so that in the case of a given intuition this faculty

or the imagination is considered as in agreement

with the faculty of concepts of understanding or

reason in its furtherance of these latter hence

both kinds of judgements are singular and yet

announce themselves as universally valid for every

subject although they lay claim merely to the

feeling of pleasure and not to any knowledge of the

object
but there are also remarkable differences between

the two the beautiful in nature is connected102

with the form of the object which consists in having

boundaries the sublime on the other hand is to

be found in a formless object so far as in it or by

occasion of it boundlessness is represented and yet

its totality is also present to thought thus the

beautiful seems to be regarded as the presentation

of an indefinite concept of understanding

the sublime as that of a like concept of reason

therefore the satisfaction in the one case is bound

up with the representation of quality in the other

with that of quantity and the latter satisfaction

is quite different in kind from the former for this

the beautiful43 directly brings with it a feeling of

the furtherance of life and thus is compatible with

charms and with the play of the imagination but

the other the feeling of the sublime43 is a pleasure

that arises only indirectly viz it is produced by

the feeling of a momentary checking of the vital

powers and a consequent stronger outflow of them

so that it seems to be regarded as emotionnot

play but earnest in the exercise of the imaginationhence

it is incompatible with charms and as

the mind is not merely attracted by the object but

is ever being alternately repelled the satisfaction

in the sublime does not so much involve a positive

pleasure as admiration or respect which rather

deserves to be called negative pleasure
but the inner and most important distinction

between the sublime and beautiful is certainly

as follows here as we are entitled to do we only

bring under consideration in the first instance the

sublime in natural objects for the sublime of art

is always limited by the conditions of agreement

with nature natural beauty which is self103subsisting

brings with it a purposiveness in its

form by which the object seems to be as it were

preadapted to our judgement and thus constitutes

in itself an object of satisfaction on the other

hand that which excites in us without any reasoning

about it but in the mere apprehension of it

the feeling of the sublime may appear as regards

its form to violate purpose in respect of the judgement

to be unsuited to our presentative faculty

and as it were to do violence to the imagination

and yet it is judged to be only the more sublime
now from this we may see that in general we

express ourselves incorrectly if we call any object of

nature sublime although we can quite correctly call

many objects of nature beautiful for how can

that be marked by an expression of approval which

is apprehended in itself as being a violation of

purpose all that we can say is that the object

is fit for the presentation of a sublimity which can

be found in the mind for no sensible form can

contain the sublime properly socalled this concerns

only ideas of the reason which although no

adequate presentation is possible for them by this

inadequacy that admits of sensible presentation are

aroused and summoned into the mind thus the

wide ocean agitated by the storm cannot be called

sublime its aspect is horrible and the mind must

be already filled with manifold ideas if it is to be

determined by such an intuition to a feeling itself

sublime as it is incited to abandon sensibility and

to busy itself with ideas that involve higher purposiveness
selfsubsisting natural beauty discovers to us a

technic of nature which represents it as a system

in accordance with laws the principle of which we104

do not find in the whole of our faculty of understanding

that principle is the principle of purposiveness

in respect of the use of our judgement

in regard to phenomena which requires that

these must not be judged as merely belonging

to nature in its purposeless mechanism but also

as belonging to something analogous to art it

therefore actually extends not indeed our cognition

of natural objects but our concept of nature which

is now not regarded as mere mechanism but as

art this leads to profound investigations as to

the possibility of such a form but in what we

are accustomed to call sublime there is nothing

at all that leads to particular objective principles

and forms of nature corresponding to them so far

from it that for the most part nature excites the ideas

of the sublime in its chaos or in its wildest and most

irregular disorder and desolation provided size and

might are perceived hence we see that the

concept of the sublime is not nearly so important

or rich in consequences as the concept of the

beautiful and that in general it displays nothing

purposive in nature itself but only in that possible

use of our intuitions of it by which there is produced

in us a feeling of a purposiveness quite independent

of nature we must seek a ground external to

ourselves for the beautiful of nature but seek it

for the sublime merely in ourselves and in our

attitude of thought which introduces sublimity into

the representation of nature this is a very needful

preliminary remark which quite separates the

ideas of the sublime from that of a purposiveness

of nature and makes the theory of the sublime

a mere appendix to the aesthetical judging of that

purposiveness because by means of it no particular105

form is represented in nature but there is only

developed a purposive use which the imagination

makes of its representation
 24 of the divisions of an investigation into the

feeling of the sublime
as regards the division of the moments of the

aesthetical judging of objects in reference to the

feeling of the sublime the analytic can proceed

according to the same principle as was adapted in

the analysis of judgements of taste for as an act

of the aesthetical reflective judgement the satisfaction

in the sublime must be represented just as in

the case of the beautifulaccording to quantity as

universally valid according to quality as devoid of

interest according to relation as subjective purposiveness

and according to modality as necessary

and so the method here will not diverge from that

of the preceding section unless indeed we count

it a difference that in the case where the aesthetical

judgement is concerned with the form of the object

we began with the investigation of its quality but

here in view of the formlessness which may belong

to what we call sublime we shall begin with quantity

as the first moment of the aesthetical judgement as

to the sublime the reason for this may be seen

from the preceding paragraph
but the analysis of the sublime involves a

division not needed in the case of the beautiful

viz a division into the mathematically and the

dynamically sublime
for the feeling of the sublime brings with it as

its characteristic feature a movement of the mind

bound up with the judging of the object while in106

the case of the beautiful taste presupposes and

maintains the mind in restful contemplation now

this movement ought to be judged as subjectively

purposive because the sublime pleases us and

thus it is referred through the imagination either to

the faculty of cognition or of desire in either

reference the purposiveness of the given representation

ought to be judged only in respect of this

faculty without purpose or interest but in the

first case it is ascribed to the object as a mathematical

determination of the imagination in the

second as dynamical and hence we have this

twofold way of representing the sublime
aof the mathematically sublime
 25 explanation of the term sublime
we call that sublime which is absolutely great

but to be great and to be a great something are

quite different concepts magnitudo and quantitas

in like manner to say simply simpliciter that

anything is great is quite different from saying that

it is absolutely great absolute non comparative

magnum the latter is what is great beyond all

comparisonwhat now is meant by the expression

that anything is great or small or of medium

size it is not a pure concept of understanding

that is thus signified still less is it an intuition of

sense and just as little is it a concept of reason

because it brings with it no principle of cognition

it must therefore be a concept of judgement or

derived from one and a subjective purposiveness

of the representation in reference to the judgement

must lie at its basis that anything is a magnitude107

quantum may be cognised from the thing itself

without any comparison of it with other things viz

if there is a multiplicity of the homogeneous constituting

one thing but to cognise how great it

is always requires some other magnitude as a

measure but because the judging of magnitude

depends not merely on multiplicity number but

also on the magnitude of the unit the measure

and since to judge of the magnitude of this latter

again requires another as measure with which it

may be compared we see that the determination

of the magnitude of phenomena can supply no

absolute concept whatever of magnitude but only

a comparative one
if now i say simply that anything is great it

appears that i have no comparison in view at least

none with an objective measure because it is thus

not determined at all how great the object is but

although the standard of comparison is merely

subjective yet the judgement none the less claims

universal assent this man is beautiful and he

is tall are judgements not limited merely to the

judging subject but like theoretical judgements

demanding the assent of every one
in a judgement by which anything is designated

simply as great it is not merely meant that the

object has a magnitude but that this magnitude is

superior to that of many other objects of the same

kind without however any exact determination of

this superiority thus there is always at the basis

of our judgement a standard which we assume as

the same for every one this however is not available

for any logical mathematically definite judging

of magnitude but only for aesthetical judging of the

same because it is a merely subjective standard108

lying at the basis of the reflective judgement upon

magnitude it may be empirical as eg the

average size of the men known to us of animals of

a certain kind trees houses mountains etc or it

may be a standard given a priori which through

the defects of the judging subject is limited by the

subjective conditions of presentation in concreto as

eg in the practical sphere the greatness of a

certain virtue or of the public liberty and justice in

a country or in the theoretical sphere the greatness

of the accuracy or the inaccuracy of an observation

or measurement that has been made etc
here it is remarkable that although we have no

interest whatever in an objectie its existence is

indifferent to usyet its mere size even if it is

considered as formless may bring a satisfaction with

it that is universally communicable and that consequently

involves the consciousness of a subjective

purposiveness in the use of our cognitive faculty

this is not indeed a satisfaction in the object

because it may be formless as in the case of the

beautiful in which the reflective judgement finds

itself purposively determined in reference to cognition

in general but a satisfaction in the extension

of the imagination by itself
if under the above limitation we say simply of

an object it is great this is no mathematically

definite judgement but a mere judgement of reflection

upon the representation of it which is subjectively

purposive for a certain use of our cognitive

powers in the estimation of magnitude and we

always then bind up with the representation a kind

of respect as also a kind of contempt for what we

simply call small further the judging of things

as great or small extends to everything even to all109

their characteristics thus we describe beauty as

great or small the reason of this is to be sought

in the fact that whatever we present in intuition

according to the precept of the judgement and thus

represent aesthetically is always a phenomenon and

thus a quantum
but if we call anything not only great but absolutely

great in every point of view great beyond all

comparison ie sublime we soon see that it is not

permissible to seek for an adequate standard of this

outside itself but merely in itself it is a magnitude

which is like itself alone it follows hence

that the sublime is not to be sought in the things of

nature but only in our ideas but in which of them

it lies must be reserved for the deduction
the foregoing explanation can be thus expressed

the sublime is that in comparison with which everything

else is small here we easily see that nothing

can be given in nature however great it is judged

by us to be which could not if considered in another

relation be reduced to the infinitely small and conversely

there is nothing so small which does not

admit of extension by our imagination to the greatness

of a world if compared with still smaller

standards telescopes have furnished us with

abundant material for making the first remark

microscopes for the second nothing therefore

which can be an object of the senses is considered

on this basis to be called sublime but because there

is in our imagination a striving towards infinite

progress and in our reason a claim for absolute

totality regarded as a real idea therefore this very

inadequateness for that idea in our faculty for

estimating the magnitude of things of sense excites

in us the feeling of a supersensible faculty and110

it is not the object of sense but the use which the

judgement naturally makes of certain objects on

behalf of this latter feeling that is absolutely great

and in comparison every other use is small consequently

it is the state of mind produced by a certain

representation with which the reflective judgement

is occupied and not the object that is to be called

sublime
we may therefore append to the preceding

formulas explaining the sublime this other the sublime

is that the mere ability to think which shows a

faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of sense
 26 of that estimation of the magnitude of natural

things which is requisite for the idea of the sublime
the estimation of magnitude by means of concepts

of number or their signs in algebra is

mathematical but that in mere intuition by the

measurement of the eye is aesthetical now we

can come by definite concepts of how great a thing is

only44 by numbers of which the unit is the measure

at all events by series of numbers progressing to

infinity and so far all logical estimation of magnitude

is mathematical but since the magnitude of

the measure must then be assumed known and this

again is only to be estimated mathematically by

means of numbersthe unit of which must be another

smaller measurewe can never have a first

or fundamental measure and therefore can never

have a definite concept of a given magnitude so

the estimation of the magnitude of the fundamental

measure must consist in this that we can immediately

apprehend it in intuition and use it by the111

imagination for the presentation of concepts of

number that is all estimation of the magnitude

of the objects of nature is in the end aesthetical ie

subjectively and not objectively determined
now for the mathematical estimation of magnitude

there is indeed no maximum for the power of

numbers extends to infinity but for its aesthetical

estimation there is always a maximum and of

this i say that if it is judged as the absolute measure

than which no greater is possible subjectively for

the judging subject it brings with it the idea of the

sublime and produces that emotion which no mathematical

estimation of its magnitude by means of

numbers can bring about except so far as the

aesthetical fundamental measure remains vividly in

the imagination for the former only presents

relative magnitude by means of comparison with

others of the same kind but the latter presents

magnitude absolutely so far as the mind can grasp

it in an intuition
in receiving a quantum into the imagination by

intuition in order to be able to use it for a measure

or as a unit for the estimation of magnitude by means

of numbers there are two operations of the imagination

involved apprehension apprehensio and comprehension

comprehensio aesthetica as to apprehension

there is no difficulty for it can go on ad

infinitum but comprehension becomes harder the

further apprehension advances and soon attains to

its maximum viz the aesthetically greatest fundamental

measure for the estimation of magnitude

for when apprehension has gone so far that the

partial representations of sensuous intuition at first

apprehended begin to vanish in the imagination

whilst this ever proceeds to the apprehension of112

others then it loses as much on the one side as it

gains on the other and in comprehension there is a

maximum beyond which it cannot go
hence can be explained what savary45 remarks in

his account of egypt viz that we must keep from

going very near the pyramids just as much as we

keep from going too far from them in order to get

the full emotional effect from their size for if we

are too far away the parts to be apprehended

the stones lying one over the other are only

obscurely represented and the representation of

them produces no effect upon the aesthetical judgement

of the subject but if we are very near the

eye requires some time to complete the apprehension

of the tiers from the bottom up to the apex and

then the first tiers are always partly forgotten before

the imagination has taken in the last and so the

comprehension of them is never completethe

same thing may sufficiently explain the bewilderment

or as it were perplexity which it is said seizes the

spectator on his first entrance into st peters at

rome for there is here a feeling of the inadequacy

of his imagination for presenting the ideas of a

whole wherein the imagination reaches its maximum

and in striving to surpass it sinks back into

itself by which however a kind of emotional satisfaction

is produced
i do not wish to speak as yet of the ground of

this satisfaction which is bound up with a representation

from which we should least of all expect it

viz a representation which lets us remark its

inadequacy and consequently its subjective want of

purposiveness for the judgement in the estimation of

magnitude i only remark that if the aesthetical113

judgement is pure ie mingled with no teleological

judgement or judgement of reason and is to be given

as a completely suitable example of the critique of

the aesthetical judgement we must not exhibit the

sublime in products of art eg buildings pillars etc

where human purpose determines the form as well

as the size nor yet in things of nature the concepts

of which bring with them a definite purpose eg

animals with a known natural destination but in

rude nature and in this only in so far as it does not

bring with it any charm or emotion produced by

actual danger merely as containing magnitude

for in this kind of representation nature contains

nothing monstrous either magnificent or horrible

the magnitude that is apprehended may be increased

as much as you wish provided it can be comprehended

in a whole by the imagination an object

is monstrous if by its size it destroys the purpose

which constitutes the concept of it but the mere

presentation of a concept is called colossal which is

almost too great for any presentation bordering on

the relatively monstrous because the purpose of

the presentation of a concept is made harder to

realise by the intuition of the object being almost

too great for our faculty of apprehensiona pure

judgement upon the sublime must however have no

purpose of the object as its determining ground if

it is to be aesthetical and not mixed up with any

judgement of understanding or reason
    
because everything which is to give disinterested

pleasure to the merely reflective judgement must

bring with the representation of it subjective and

as subjective universally valid purposiveness114although

no purposiveness of the form of the object

lies as in the case of the beautiful at the ground of

the judgementthe question arises what is this

subjective purposiveness and how does it come

to be prescribed as the norm by which a ground for

universally valid satisfaction is supplied in the mere

estimation of magnitude even in that which is

forced up to the point where our faculty of imagination

is inadequate for the presentation of the concept

of magnitude
in the process of combination requisite for the

estimation of magnitude the imagination proceeds

of itself to infinity without anything hindering it

but the understanding guides it by means of concepts

of number for which the imagination must furnish

the schema and in this procedure as belonging to

the logical estimation of magnitude there is indeed

something objectively purposivein accordance

with the concept of a purpose as all measurement

isbut nothing purposive and pleasing for the

aesthetical judgement there is also in this

designed purposiveness nothing which would force

us to push the magnitude of the measure and consequently

the comprehension of the manifold in an

intuition to the bounds of the faculty of imagination

or as far as ever this can reach in its presentations

for in the estimation of magnitude by the understanding

arithmetic we only go to a certain point

whether we push the comprehension of the units up

to the number 10 as in the decimal scale or only

up to 4 as in the quaternary scale the further

production of magnitude proceeds by combination

or if the quantum is given in intuition by apprehension

but merely by way of progression not of

comprehension in accordance with an assumed115

principle of progression in this mathematical

estimation of magnitude the understanding is equally

served and contented whether the imagination

chooses for unit a magnitude that we can take in in

a glance eg a foot or rod or a german mile or

even the earths diameterof which the apprehension

is indeed possible but not the comprehension

in an intuition of the imagination not possible by

comprehensio aesthetica although quite possible by

comprehensio logica in a concept of number in both

cases the logical estimation of magnitude goes on

without hindrance to infinity
but now the mind listens to the voice of reason

which for every given magnitudeeven for those

that can never be entirely apprehended although in

sensible representation they are judged as entirely

givenrequires totality reason consequently

desires comprehension in one intuition and so the

presentation of all these members of a progressively

increasing series it does not even exempt the

infinite space and past time from this requirement

it rather renders it unavoidable to think the infinite

in the judgement of common reason as entirely

given according to its totality
but the infinite is absolutely not merely comparatively

great compared with it everything

else of the same kind of magnitudes is small and

what is most important is that to be able only to

think it as a whole indicates a faculty of mind which

surpasses every standard of sense for to represent

it sensibly would require a comprehension

having for unit a standard bearing a definite relation

expressible in numbers to the infinite which is

impossible nevertheless the bare capability of

thinking this infinite without contradiction requires116

in the human mind a faculty itself supersensible for

it is only by means of this faculty and its idea of a

noumenonwhich admits of no intuition but

which yet serves as the substrate for the intuition

of the world as a mere phenomenonthat the

infinite of the world of sense in the pure intellectual

estimation of magnitude can be completely comprehended

under a concept although in the mathematical

estimation of magnitude by means of concepts

of number it can never be completely thought the

faculty of being able to think the infinite of supersensible

intuition as given in its intelligible substrate

surpasses every standard of sensibility and

is great beyond all comparison even with the faculty

of mathematical estimation not of course in a

theoretical point of view and on behalf of the

cognitive faculty but as an extension of the mind

which feels itself able in another practical point of

view to go beyond the limit of sensibility
nature is therefore sublime in those of its

phenomena whose intuition brings with it the idea

of their infinity this last can only come by the inadequacy

of the greatest effort of our imagination to

estimate the magnitude of an object but now in

mathematical estimation of magnitude the imagination

is equal to providing a sufficient measure for

every object because the numerical concepts of the

understanding by means of progression can make

any measure adequate to any given magnitude

therefore it must be the aesthetical estimation

of magnitude in which it is felt that the effort

towards comprehension surpasses the power of

the imagination to grasp in a whole of intuition

the progressive apprehension and at the same

time is perceived the inadequacy of this faculty117

unbounded in its progress for grasping and using

for the estimation of magnitude a fundamental

measure which could be made available by the

understanding with little trouble now the proper

unchangeable fundamental measure of nature is its

absolute whole which regarding nature as a

phenomenon would be infinity comprehended but

since this fundamental measure is a selfcontradictory

concept on account of the impossibility of the

absolute totality of an endless progress that magnitude

of a natural object on which the imagination

fruitlessly spends its whole faculty of comprehension

must carry our concept of nature to a supersensible

substrate which lies at its basis and also at the basis

of our faculty of thought as this however is

great beyond all standards of sense it makes us judge

as sublime not so much the object as our own state

of mind in the estimation of it
therefore just as the aesthetical judgement in

judging the beautiful refers the imagination in its

free play to the understanding in order to harmonise

it with the concepts of the latter in general without

any determination of them so does the same

faculty when judging a thing as sublime refer itself

to the reason in order that it may subjectively be

in accordance with its ideas no matter what they

areie that it may produce a state of mind

conformable to them and compatible with that

brought about by the influence of definite practical

ideas upon feeling
we hence see also that true sublimity must be

sought only in the mind of the subject judging

not in the natural object the judgement upon which

occasions this state who would call sublime eg

shapeless mountain masses piled in wild disorder118

upon each other with their pyramids of ice or the

gloomy raging sea but the mind feels itself

elevated in its own judgement if while contemplating

them without any reference to their form and

abandoning itself to the imagination and to the

reasonwhich although placed in combination with

the imagination without any definite purpose

merely extends itit yet finds the whole power of

the imagination inadequate to its ideas
examples of the mathematically sublime of

nature in mere intuition are all the cases in which

we are given not so much a larger numerical

concept as a large unit for the measure of the

imagination for shortening the numerical series

a tree the height of which we estimate with

reference to the height of a man at all events gives

a standard for a mountain and if this were a mile

high it would serve as unit for the number expressive

of the earths diameter so that the latter

might be made intuitible the earths diameter

would supply a unit for the known planetary

system this again for the milky way and the

immeasurable number of milky way systems called

nebulaewhich presumably constitute a system of

the same kind among themselveslets us expect

no bounds here now the sublime in the aesthetical

judging of an immeasurable whole like this lies

not so much in the greatness of the number of

units as in the fact that in our progress we ever

arrive at yet greater units to this the systematic

division of the universe contributes which represents

every magnitude in nature as small in its turn and

represents our imagination with its entire freedom

from bounds and with it nature as a mere nothing

in comparison with the ideas of reason if it is119

sought to furnish a presentation which shall be

adequate to them
 27 of the quality of the satisfaction in our

judgements upon the sublime
the feeling of our incapacity to attain to an

idea which is a law for us is respect now the

idea of the comprehension of every phenomenon

that can be given us in the intuition of a whole is

an idea prescribed to us by a law of reason which

recognises no other measure definite valid for

every one and invariable than the absolute whole

but our imagination even in its greatest efforts in

respect of that comprehension which we expect

from it of a given object in a whole of intuition

and thus with reference to the presentation of the

idea of reason exhibits its own limits and inadequacy

although at the same time it shows that

its destination is to make itself adequate to this

idea regarded as a law therefore the feeling of the

sublime in nature is respect for our own destination

which by a certain subreption we attribute to

an object of nature conversion of respect for the

idea of humanity in our own subject into respect

for the object this makes intuitively evident

the superiority of the rational determination of our

cognitive faculties to the greatest faculty of our

sensibility
the feeling of the sublime is therefore a feeling

of pain arising from the want of accordance between

the aesthetical estimation of magnitude formed

by the imagination and the estimation of the same

formed by reason there is at the same time a

pleasure thus excited arising from the correspondence120

with rational ideas of this very judgement

of the inadequacy of our greatest faculty of sense

in so far as it is a law for us to strive after these

ideas in fact it is for us a law of reason and

belongs to our destination to estimate as small in

comparison with ideas of reason everything which

nature regarded as an object of sense contains

that is great for us and that which arouses in us

the feeling of this supersensible destination agrees

with that law now the greatest effort of the

imagination in the presentation of the unit for the

estimation of magnitude indicates a reference to

something absolutely great and consequently a

reference to the law of reason which bids us take

this alone as the supreme measure of magnitude

therefore the inner perception of the inadequacy

of all sensible standards for rational estimation of

magnitude indicates a correspondence with rational

laws it involves a pain which arouses in us the

feeling of our supersensible destination according

to which it is purposive and therefore pleasurable

to find every standard of sensibility inadequate to

the ideas of understanding
the mind feels itself moved in the representation

of the sublime in nature whilst in aesthetical

judgements about the beautiful it is in restful

contemplation this movement may especially in

its beginnings be compared to a vibration ie to a

quickly alternating attraction towards and repulsion

from the same object the transcendent towards

which the imagination is impelled in its apprehension

of intuition is for the imagination like an abyss in

which it fears to lose itself but for the rational

idea of the supersensible it is not transcendent but

in conformity with law to bring about such an121

effort of the imagination and consequently here

there is the same amount of attraction as there was

of repulsion for the mere sensibility but the

judgement itself always remains in this case only

aesthetical becausewithout having any determinate

concept of the object at its basisit merely

represents the subjective play of the mental powers

imagination and reason as harmonious through

their very contrast for just as imagination and

understanding in judging of the beautiful generate

a subjective purposiveness of the mental powers

by means of their harmony so here46 imagination

and reason do so by means of their conflict that

is they bring about a feeling that we possess pure

selfsubsistent reason or a faculty for the estimation

of magnitude whose preeminence can be made

intuitively evident only by the inadequacy of that

faculty imagination which is itself unbounded in

the presentation of magnitudes of sensible objects
the measurement of a space regarded as

apprehension is at the same time a description of it

and thus an objective movement in the act of imagination

and a progress on the other hand the comprehension

of the manifold in the unitynot of thought

but of intuitionand consequently the comprehension

of the successively apprehended elements in one

glance is a regress which annihilates the condition of

time in this progress of the imagination and makes

coexistence intuitible47 it is therefore since the

timeseries is a condition of the internal sense and

of an intuition a subjective movement of the122

imagination by which it does violence to the

internal sense this must be the more noticeable

the greater the quantum is which the imagination

comprehends in one intuition the effort therefore

to receive in one single intuition a measure for

magnitudes that requires an appreciable time to

apprehend is a kind of representation which subjectively

considered is contrary to purpose but

objectively as requisite for the estimation of magnitude

it is purposive thus that very violence

which is done to the subject through the imagination

is judged as purposive in reference to the whole

determination of the mind
the quality of the feeling of the sublime is that

it is a feeling of pain in reference to the faculty by

which we judge aesthetically of an object which pain

however is represented at the same time as purposive

this is possible through the fact that the very incapacity

in question discovers the consciousness of

an unlimited faculty of the same subject and that

the mind can only judge of the latter aesthetically

by means of the former
in the logical estimation of magnitude the

impossibility of ever arriving at absolute totality

by means of the progress of the measurement of

things of the sensible world in time and space was

cognised as objective ie as an impossibility of

thinking the infinite as entirely given and not as

merely subjective or that there was only an incapacity

to grasp it for there we have not to

do with the degree of comprehension in an intuition

regarded as a measure but everything depends on a

concept of number but in aesthetical estimation of

magnitude the concept of number must disappear or

be changed and the comprehension of the imagination123

in reference to the unit of measure thus avoiding the

concepts of a law of the successive production of

concepts of magnitude is alone purposive for itif

now a magnitude almost reaches the limit of our

faculty of comprehension in an intuition and yet

the imagination is invited by means of numerical

magnitudes in respect of which we are conscious

that our faculty is unbounded to aesthetical comprehension

in a greater unit then we mentally feel ourselves

confined aesthetically within bounds but

nevertheless the pain in regard to the necessary

extension of the imagination for accordance with

that which is unbounded in our faculty of reason

viz the idea of the absolute whole and consequently

the very unpurposiveness of the faculty of imagination

for rational ideas and the arousing of them

are represented as purposive thus it is that the

aesthetical judgement itself is subjectively purposive

for the reason as the source of ideas ie as the

source of an intellectual comprehension for which all

aesthetical comprehension is small and there accompanies

the reception of an object as sublime a

pleasure which is only possible through the medium

of a pain
bof the dynamically sublime in nature
 28 of nature regarded as might
might is that which is superior to great

hindrances it is called dominion if it is superior

to the resistance of that which itself possesses might

nature considered in an aesthetical judgement as

might that has no dominion over us is dynamically

sublime
124

if nature is to be judged by us as dynamically

sublime it must be represented as exciting fear

although it is not true conversely that every object

which excites fear is regarded in our aesthetical judgement

as sublime for in aesthetical judgements

without the aid of concepts superiority to hindrances

can only be judged according to the greatness of the

resistance now that which we are driven to resist

is an evil and if we do not find our faculties a match

for it is an object of fear hence nature can be

regarded by the aesthetical judgement as might and

consequently as dynamically sublime only so far as

it is considered an object of fear
but we can regard an object as fearful without

being afraid of it viz if we judge of it in such a

way that we merely think a case in which we would

wish to resist it and yet in which all resistance would

be altogether vain thus the virtuous man fears

god without being afraid of him because to wish

to resist him and his commandments he thinks is

a case as to which he need not be anxious but

in every such case that he thinks as not impossible

he cognises him as fearful
he who fears can form no judgement about the

sublime in nature just as he who is seduced by

inclination and appetite can form no judgement about

the beautiful the former flies from the sight of

an object which inspires him with awe and it is impossible

to find satisfaction in a terror that is seriously

felt hence the pleasurableness arising from the

cessation of an uneasiness is a state of joy but

this on account of the deliverance from danger

which is involved is a state of joy conjoined with

the resolve not to expose ourselves to the danger

again we cannot willingly look back upon our125

sensations of danger much less seek the occasion

for them again
bold overhanging and as it were threatening

rocks clouds piled up in the sky moving with lightning

flashes and thunder peals volcanoes in all their

violence of destruction hurricanes with their track

of devastation the boundless ocean in a state of

tumult the lofty waterfall of a mighty river and

such like these exhibit our faculty of resistance as

insignificantly small in comparison with their might

but the sight of them is the more attractive the more

fearful it is provided only that we are in security

and we readily call these objects sublime because

they raise the energies of the soul above their

accustomed height and discover in us a faculty of

resistance of a quite different kind which gives us

courage to measure ourselves against the apparent

almightiness of nature
now in the immensity of nature and in the

inadequacy of our faculties for adopting a standard

proportionate to the aesthetical estimation of the

magnitude of its realm we find our own limitation

although at the same time in our rational faculty we

find a different nonsensuous standard which has

that infinity itself under it as a unit and in comparison

with which everything in nature is small thus

in our mind we find a superiority to nature even in

its immensity and so also the irresistibility of its

might while making us recognise our own physical48

impotence considered as beings of nature

discloses to us a faculty of judging independently of

and a superiority over nature on which is based a

kind of selfpreservation entirely different from that

which can be attacked and brought into danger by126

external nature thus humanity in our person

remains unhumiliated though the individual might

have to submit to this dominion in this way nature

is not judged to be sublime in our aesthetical judgements

in so far as it excites fear but because it calls

up that power in us which is not nature of regarding

as small the things about which we are solicitous

goods health and life and of regarding its might

to which we are no doubt subjected in respect of

these things as nevertheless without any dominion

over us and our personality to which we must bow

where our highest fundamental propositions and

their assertion or abandonment are concerned

therefore nature is here called sublime merely

because it elevates the imagination to a presentation

of those cases in which the mind can make felt the

proper sublimity of its destination in comparison

with nature itself
this estimation of ourselves loses nothing

through the fact that we must regard ourselves as

safe in order to feel this inspiriting satisfaction

and that hence as there is no seriousness in the

danger there might be also as might seem to be

the case just as little seriousness in the sublimity

of our spiritual faculty for the satisfaction here

concerns only the destination of our faculty which

discloses itself in such a case so far as the tendency

to this destination lies in our nature whilst its

development and exercise remain incumbent and

obligatory and in this there is truth however

conscious the man may be of his present actual

powerlessness when he stretches his reflection so

far
no doubt this principle seems to be too farfetched

and too subtly reasoned and consequently127

seems to go beyond the scope of an aesthetical

judgement but observation of men proves the

opposite and shows that it may lie at the root of the

most ordinary judgements although we are not

always conscious of it for what is that which is

even to the savage an object of the greatest

admiration it is a man who shrinks from nothing

who fears nothing and therefore does not yield to

danger but rather goes to face it vigorously with

the fullest deliberation even in the most highly

civilised state this peculiar veneration for the soldier

remains though only under the condition that he

exhibit all the virtues of peace gentleness compassion

and even a becoming care for his own

person because even by these it is recognised

that his mind is unsubdued by danger hence

whatever disputes there may be about the

superiority of the respect which is to be accorded

them in the comparison of a statesman and a

general the aesthetical judgement decides for the

latter war itself if it is carried on with order and

with a sacred respect for the rights of citizens has

something sublime in it and makes the disposition

of the people who carry it on thus only the more

sublime the more numerous are the dangers to

which they are exposed and in respect of which

they behave with courage on the other hand a

long peace generally brings about a predominant

commercial spirit and along with it low selfishness

cowardice and effeminacy and debases the disposition

of the people49
it appears to conflict with this solution of the

concept of the sublime so far as sublimity is

ascribed to might that we are accustomed to128

represent god as presenting himself in his wrath

and yet in his sublimity in the tempest the storm

the earthquake etc and that it would be foolish

and criminal to imagine a superiority of our minds

over these works of his and as it seems even

over the designs of such might hence it would

appear that no feeling of the sublimity of our own

nature but rather subjection abasement and a

feeling of complete powerlessness is a fitting state

of mind before the manifestation of such an object

and this is generally bound up with the idea of it

during natural phenomena of this kind generally

in religion prostration adoration with bent head

with contrite anxious demeanour and voice seems

to be the only fitting behaviour in presence of

the godhead and hence most peoples have

adopted and still observe it but this state of

mind is far from being necessarily bound up

with the idea of the sublimity of a religion and

its object the man who is actually afraid

because he finds reasons for fear in himself whilst

conscious by his culpable disposition of offending

against a might whose will is irresistible and

at the same time just is not in the frame of mind

for admiring the divine greatness for this a mood

of calm contemplation and a quite free judgement

are needed only if he is conscious of an upright

disposition pleasing to god do those operations of

might serve to awaken in him the idea of the

sublimity of this being for then he recognises in

himself a sublimity of disposition conformable to

his will and thus he is raised above the fear of

such operations of nature which he no longer

regards as outbursts of his wrath even humility

in the shape of a stern judgement upon his own129

faultswhich otherwise with a consciousness of good

intentions could be easily palliated from the frailty

of human natureis a sublime state of mind

consisting in a voluntary subjection of himself to the

pain of remorse in order that its causes may be

gradually removed in this way religion is essentially

distinguished from superstition the latter

establishes in the mind not reverence for the

sublime but fear and apprehension of the allpowerful

being to whose will the terrified man sees

himself subject without according him any high

esteem from this nothing can arise but a seeking

of favour and flattery instead of a religion which

consists in a good life50
sublimity therefore does not reside in anything

of nature but only in our mind in so far as we can

become conscious that we are superior to nature

within and therefore also to nature without us so

far as it influences us everything that excites

this feeling in us eg the might of nature which

calls forth our forces is called then although

improperly sublime only by supposing this idea

in ourselves and in reference to it are we capable of

attaining to the idea of the sublimity of that being

which produces respect in us not merely by the

might that it displays in nature but rather by

means of the faculty which resides in us of judging

it fearlessly and of regarding our destination as

sublime in respect of it
130
 29 of the modality of the judgement upon the

sublime in nature
there are numberless beautiful things in nature

about which we can assume and even expect without

being far mistaken the harmony of every

ones judgement with our own but in respect of

our judgement upon the sublime in nature we cannot

promise ourselves so easily the accordance of others

for a far greater culture as well of the aesthetical

judgement as of the cognitive faculties which lie

at its basis seems requisite in order to be able

to pass judgement on this preeminent quality of

natural objects
that the mind be attuned to feel the sublime

postulates a susceptibility of the mind for ideas

for in the very inadequacy of nature to these

latter and thus only by presupposing them and by

straining the imagination to use nature as a schema

for them is to be found that which is terrible to

sensibility and yet is attractive it is attractive

because reason exerts a dominion over sensibility

in order to extend it in conformity with its own

realm the practical and to make it look out

into the infinite which is for it an abyss in

fact without development of moral ideas that

which we prepared by culture call sublime presents

itself to the uneducated man merely as terrible

in the indications of the dominion of nature in

destruction and in the great scale of its might

in comparison with which his own is a vanishing

quantity he will only see the misery danger and

distress which surround the man who is exposed to

it so the good and indeed intelligent savoyard131

peasant as herr von saussure51 relates unhesitatingly

called all lovers of snowmountains fools

and who knows whether he would have been so

completely wrong if saussure had undertaken

the danger to which he exposed himself merely as

most travellers do from amateur curiosity or that

he might be able to give a pathetic account of them

but his design was the instruction of men and

this excellent man gave the readers of his travels

soulstirring sensations such as he himself had into

the bargain
but although the judgement upon the sublime

in nature needs culture more than the judgement

upon the beautiful it is not therefore primarily

produced by culture and introduced in a merely

conventional way into society rather has it root

in human nature even in that which alike with

common understanding we can impute to and

expect of every one viz in the tendency to the

feeling for practical ideas ie to the moral feeling
hereon is based the necessity of that agreement

of the judgement of others about the sublime with

our own which we include in the latter for just

as we charge with want of taste the man who is indifferent

when passing judgement upon an object of

nature that we regard as beautiful so we say of him

who remains unmoved in the presence of that which

we judge to be sublime he has no feeling but we

claim both from every man and we presuppose them

in him if he has any culture at all only with the

difference that we expect the former directly of

every one because in it the judgement refers the

imagination merely to the understanding the faculty132

of concepts but the latter because in it the

imagination is related to the reason the faculty of

ideas only under a subjective presupposition which

however we believe we are authorised in imputing

to every one viz the presupposition of the moral

feeling in man52 thus it is that we ascribe necessity

to this aesthetical judgement also
in this modality of aesthetical judgements viz in

the necessity claimed for them lies an important

moment of the critique of judgement for it

enables us to recognise in them an a priori principle

and raises them out of empirical psychology in which

otherwise they would remain buried amongst the

feelings of gratification and grief only with the

unmeaning addition of being called finer feelings

thus it enables us too to place the judgement

among those faculties that have a priori principles

at their basis and so to bring it into transcendental

philosophy


general remark upon the exposition of the aesthetical reflective judgement
in reference to the feeling of pleasure an object

is to be classified as either pleasant or beautiful or

sublime or good absolutely jucundum pulchrum

sublime honestum
the pleasant as motive of desire is always of

one and the same kind no matter whence it comes

and however specifically different the representation

of sense and sensation objectively considered

may be hence in judging its influence on the

mind account is taken only of the number of its

charms simultaneous and successive and so only133

of the mass as it were of the pleasant sensation

and this can be made intelligible only by quantity

it has no reference to culture but belongs to mere

enjoymenton the other hand the beautiful

requires the representation of a certain quality of

the object that can be made intelligible and

reduced to concepts although it is not so reduced

in an aesthetical judgement and it cultivates us in

that it teaches us to attend to the purposiveness

in the feeling of pleasurethe sublime consists

merely in the relation by which the sensible in the

representation of nature is judged available for a

possible supersensible usethe absolutely good

subjectively judged according to the feeling that

it inspires the object of the moral feeling as

capable of determining the powers of the subject

through the representation of an absolutely compelling

law is specially distinguished by the modality

of a necessity that rests a priori upon concepts

this necessity involves not merely a claim but a

command for the assent of every one and belongs

in itself to the pure intellectual rather than to the

aesthetical judgement and is by a determinant and

not a mere reflective judgement ascribed not to

nature but to freedom but the determinability

of the subject by means of this idea and especially

of a subject that can feel hindrances in sensibility

and at the same time its superiority to them by their

subjugation involving a modification of its stateie

the moral feelingis yet so far cognate to the

aesthetical judgement and its formal conditions

that it can serve to represent the conformity to

law of action from duty as aesthetical ie as

sublime or even as beautiful without losing its

purity this would not be so if we were to put134

it in natural combination with the feeling of the

pleasant
if we take the result of the foregoing exposition

of the two kinds of aesthetical judgements there

arise therefrom the following short explanations
the beautiful is what pleases in the mere

judgement and therefore not by the medium of

sensation in accordance with a concept of the understanding

it follows at once from this that it

must please apart from all interest
the sublime is what pleases immediately through

its opposition to the interest of sense
both as explanations of aesthetical universally

valid judging are referred to subjective grounds

in the one case to grounds of sensibility in favour of

the contemplative understanding in the other case

in opposition to sensibility but on behalf of the purposes

of practical reason both however united

in the same subject are purposive in reference to

the moral feeling the beautiful prepares us to

love disinterestedly something even nature itself

the sublime prepares us to esteem something highly

even in opposition to our own sensible interest
we may describe the sublime thus it is an

object of nature the representation of which determines

the mind to think the unattainability of nature

regarded as a presentation of ideas
literally taken and logically considered ideas

cannot be presented but if we extend our empirical

representative faculty mathematically or

dynamically to the intuition of nature reason

inevitably intervenes as the faculty expressing the

independence of absolute totality53 and generates the135

effort of the mind vain though it be to make the

representation of the senses adequate to this this

effortand the feeling of the unattainability of the

idea by means of the imaginationis itself a presentation

of the subjective purposiveness of our

mind in the employment of the imagination for its

supersensible destination and forces us subjectively

to think nature itself in its totality as a presentation

of something supersensible without being

able objectively to arrive at this presentation
for we soon see that nature in space and time

entirely lacks the unconditioned and consequently

that absolute magnitude which yet is desired by

the most ordinary reason it is by this that we

are reminded that we only have to do with nature

as phenomenon and that it must be regarded as

the mere presentation of a nature in itself of which

reason has the idea but this idea of the supersensible

which we can no further determineso

that we cannot know but only think nature as its

presentationis awakened in us by means of an

object whose aesthetical appreciation strains the

imagination to its utmost bounds whether of extension

mathematical or of its might over the

mind dynamical and this judgement is based

upon a feeling of the minds destination which

entirely surpasses the realm of the former ie upon

the moral feeling in respect of which the representation

of the object is judged as subjectively

purposive
in fact a feeling for the sublime in nature

cannot well be thought without combining therewith

a mental disposition which is akin to the moral

and although the immediate pleasure in the beautiful

of nature likewise presupposes and cultivates a136

certain liberality in our mental attitude ie a satisfaction

independent of mere sensible enjoyment yet

freedom is thus represented as in play rather than

in that lawdirected occupation which is the genuine

characteristic of human morality in which reason

must exercise dominion over sensibility but in

aesthetical judgements upon the sublime this dominion

is represented as exercised by the imagination

regarded as an instrument of reason
the satisfaction in the sublime of nature is

then only negative whilst that in the beautiful is

positive viz a feeling that the imagination is

depriving itself of its freedom while it is purposively

determined according to a different law from that

of its empirical employment it thus acquires an

extension and a might greater than it sacrificesthe

ground of which however is concealed from

itself whilst yet it feels the sacrifice or the

deprivation and at the same time the cause to

which it is subjected astonishment that borders

upon terror the dread and the holy awe which

seizes the observer at the sight of mountain peaks

rearing themselves to heaven deep chasms and

streams raging therein deepshadowed solitudes

that dispose one to melancholy meditationsthis

in the safety in which we know ourselves to be is

not actual fear but only an attempt to feel fear by

the aid of the imagination that we may feel the

might of this faculty in combining with the minds

repose the mental movement thereby excited and

being thus superior to internal natureand therefore

to externalso far as this can have any influence

on our feeling of wellbeing for the imagination

by the laws of association makes our state of contentment

dependent on physical causes but it also137

by the principles of the schematism of the judgement

being so far therefore ranked under freedom is

the instrument of reason and its ideas and as such

has might to maintain our independence of natural

influences to regard as small what in reference to

them is great and so to place the absolutely great

only in the proper destination of the subject the

raising of this reflection of the aesthetical judgement

so as to be adequate to reason though without a

definite concept of reason represents the object as

subjectively purposive even by the objective want

of accordance between the imagination in its greatest

extension and the reason as the faculty of ideas
we must here generally attend to what has

been already noted that in the transcendental

aesthetic of judgement we must speak solely of pure

aesthetical judgements consequently our examples

are not to be taken from such beautiful or sublime

objects of nature as presuppose the concept of a

purpose for if so the purposiveness would be

either teleological or would be based on mere sensations

of an object gratification or grief and thus

would be in the former case not aesthetical in the

latter not merely formal if then we call the sight

of the starry heaven sublime we must not place at

the basis of our judgement concepts of worlds

inhabited by rational beings and regard the bright

points with which we see the space above us filled

as their suns moving in circles purposively fixed

with reference to them but we must regard it

just as we see it as a distant allembracing vault

only under such a representation can we range that

sublimity which a pure aesthetical judgement ascribes

to this object and in the same way if we are to

call the sight of the ocean sublime we must not138
think of it as we ordinarily do endowed as we are

with all kinds of knowledge not contained however

in the immediate intuition for example we sometimes

think of the ocean as a vast kingdom of aquatic

creatures or as the great source of those vapours

that fill the air with clouds for the benefit of the

land or again as an element which though dividing

continents from each other yet promotes the greatest

communication between them but these furnish

merely teleological judgements to call the ocean

sublime we must regard it as poets do merely by

what strikes the eye if it is at rest as a clear

mirror of water only bounded by the heaven if

it is restless as an abyss threatening to overwhelm

everything the like is to be said of the sublime

and beautiful in the human figure we must not

regard as the determining grounds of our judgement

the concepts of the purposes which all our limbs serve

and we must not allow this coincidence to influence

our aesthetical judgement for then it would no longer

be pure although it is certainly a necessary condition

of aesthetical satisfaction that there should be

no conflict between them aesthetical purposiveness

is the conformity to law of the judgement in its freedom

the satisfaction in the object depends on

the relation in which we wish to place the imagination

always provided that it by itself entertains the

mind in free occupation if on the other hand

the judgement be determined by anything elsewhether

sensation or conceptalthough it may be

conformable to law it cannot be the act of a free

judgement
if then we speak of intellectual beauty or sublimity

these expressions are first not quite accurate

because beauty and sublimity are aesthetical modes139

of representation which would not be found in us at

all if we were pure intelligences or even regarded

ourselves as such in thought secondly although

both as objects of an intellectual moral satisfaction

are so far compatible with aesthetical satisfaction

that they rest upon no interest yet they are difficult

to unite with it because they are meant to produce

an interest this if its presentation is to harmonise

with the satisfaction in the aesthetical judgement

could only arise by means of a sensible interest that

we combine with it in the presentation and thus

damage would be done to the intellectual purposiveness

and it would lose its purity
the object of a pure and unconditioned intellectual

satisfaction is the moral law in that might

which it exercises in us over all mental motives that

precede it this might only makes itself aesthetically

known to us through sacrifices which causing a

feeling of deprivation though on behalf of internal

freedom in return discloses in us an unfathomable

depth of this supersensible faculty with consequences

extending beyond our ken thus the satisfaction on

the aesthetical side in relation to sensibility is negative

ie against this interest but regarded from the

intellectual side it is positive and combined with an

interest hence it follows that the intellectual in

itself purposive moral good aesthetically judged

must be represented as sublime rather than beautiful

so that it rather awakens the feeling of respect

which disdains charm than that of love and familiar

inclination for human nature does not attach itself

to this good spontaneously but only by the authority

which reason exercises over sensibility conversely

also that which we call sublime in nature

whether external or internal eg certain affections140

is only represented as a might in the mind to

overcome certain54 hindrances of the sensibility by

means of moral fundamental propositions and only

thus does it interest
i will dwell a moment on this latter point the

idea of the good conjoined with affection is called

enthusiasm this state of mind seems to be

sublime to the extent that we commonly assert that

nothing great could be done without it now every

affection55 is blind either in the choice of its purpose

or if this be supplied by reason in its accomplishment

for it is a mental movement which makes

it impossible to exercise a free deliberation about

fundamental propositions so as to determine ourselves

thereby it can therefore in no way deserve

the approval of the reason nevertheless aesthetically

enthusiasm is sublime because it is a tension

of forces produced by ideas which give an impulse

to the mind that operates far more powerfully and

lastingly than the impulse arising from sensible

representations but which seems strange the

absence of affection apatheia phlegma in significatu

bono in a mind that vigorously follows its unalterable

principles is sublime and in a far preferable

way because it has also on its side the satisfaction141

of pure reason56 it is only a mental state of this kind

that is called noble and this expression is subsequently

applied to things eg a building a garment

literary style bodily presence etc when these do not

so much arouse astonishment the affection produced

by the representation of novelty exceeding our

expectations as admiration astonishment that does

not cease when the novelty disappears and this

is the case when ideas agree in their presentation

undesignedly and artlessly with the aesthetical

satisfaction
every affection of the strenuous kind viz that

excites the consciousness of our power to overcome

every obstacleanimi strenui is aesthetically sublime

eg wrath even despair ie the despair of indignation

not of faintheartedness but affections of the

languid kind which make the very effort of resistance

an object of painanimum languidum have

nothing noble in themselves but they may be reckoned

under the sensuously beautiful emotions which may

rise to the strength of affections are very different

we have both spirited and tender emotions the

latter if they rise to the height of affections are

worthless the propensity to them is called sentimentality

a sympathetic grief that will not admit

of consolation or one referring to imaginary evils to

which we deliberately surrender ourselvesbeing

deceived by fancyas if they were actual indicates

and produces a tender57 though weak soulwhich

shows a beautiful side and which can be called

fanciful though not enthusiastic romances lacrymose142

plays shallow moral precepts which toy with

falsely socalled moral dispositions but in fact

make the heart languid insensible to the severe

precept of duty and incapable of all respect for the

worth of humanity in our own person and for the

rights of men a very different thing from their

happiness and in general incapable of all steady

principle even a religious discourse58 which recommends

a cringing abject seeking of favour and

ingratiation of ourselves which proposes the

abandonment of all confidence in our own faculties

in opposition to the evil within us instead of a

sturdy resolution to endeavour to overcome our

inclinations by means of those powers which with all

our frailty yet remain to us that false humility

which sets the only way of pleasing the supreme

being in selfdepreciation in whining hypocritical

repentance and in a mere passive state of mindthese

are not compatible with any frame of mind

that can be counted beautiful still less with one

which is to be counted sublime
but even stormy movements of mind which may

be connected under the name of edification with

ideas of religion oras merely belonging to culturewith

ideas containing a social interest can in no

way however they strain the imagination lay claim

to the honour of being sublime presentations unless

they leave after them a mental mood which although

only indirectly has influence upon the minds

consciousness of its strength and its resolution in

reference to that which involves pure intellectual

purposiveness the supersensible for otherwise

all these emotions belong only to motion which one

would fain enjoy for the sake of health the143

pleasant exhaustion consequent upon such disturbance

produced by the play of the affections is

an enjoyment of our wellbeing arising from the

restored equilibrium of the various vital forces

this in the end amounts to the same thing as that

state which eastern voluptuaries find so delightful

when they get their bodies as it were kneaded and

all their muscles and joints softly pressed and bent

only that in this case the motive principle is for the

most part external in the other case it is altogether

internal many a man believes himself to be edified

by a sermon when indeed there is no edification at

all no system of good maxims or to be improved

by a tragedy when he is only glad at his ennui being

happily dispelled so the sublime must always have

reference to the disposition ie to the maxims which

furnish to the intellectual part and to the ideas of

reason a superiority over sensibility
we need not fear that the feeling of the sublime

will lose by so abstract a mode of presentationwhich

is quite negative in respect of what is sensiblefor

the imagination although it finds nothing beyond

the sensible to which it can attach itself yet

feels itself unbounded by this removal of its limitations

and thus that very abstraction is a presentation

of the infinite which can be nothing but a mere

negative presentation but which yet expands the

soul perhaps there is no sublimer passage in the

jewish law than the command thou shalt not

make to thyself any graven image nor the likeness

of anything which is in heaven or on the earth or

under the earth etc this command alone can

explain the enthusiasm that the jewish people in

their moral period felt for their religion when they

compared themselves with other peoples or explain144

the pride which mahommedanism inspires the

same is true of the moral law and of the tendency to

morality in us it is quite erroneous to fear that if

we deprive this tendency of all that can recommend

it to sense it will only involve a cold lifeless assent

and no moving force or emotion it is quite the other

way for where the senses see nothing more before

them and the unmistakable and indelible idea of

morality remains it would be rather necessary to

moderate the impetus of an unbounded imagination

to prevent it from rising to enthusiasm than through

fear of the powerlessness of these ideas to seek aid

for them in images and childish ritual thus

governments have willingly allowed religion to be

abundantly provided with the latter accessories

and seeking thereby to relieve their subjects of

trouble they have also sought to deprive them of

the faculty of extending their spiritual powers beyond

the limits that are arbitrarily assigned to them and

by means of which they can be the more easily

treated as mere passive59 beings
this pure elevating merely negative presentation

of morality brings with it on the other hand no

danger of fanaticism which is a delusion that we can

will ourselves to see something beyond all bounds of

sensibility ie to dream in accordance with fundamental

propositions or to go mad with reason and

this is so just because this presentation is merely

negative for the inscrutableness of the idea of

freedom quite cuts it off from any positive presentation

but the moral law is in itself sufficiently

and originally determinant in us so that it does

not permit us to cast a glance at any ground of

determination external to itself if enthusiasm is145

comparable to madness fanaticism is comparable to

monomania of which the latter is least of all compatible

with the sublime because in its detail it is

ridiculous in enthusiasm regarded as an affection

the imagination is without bridle in fanaticism

regarded as an inveterate brooding passion it is

without rule the first is a transitory accident

which sometimes befalls the soundest understanding

the second is a disease which unsettles it
simplicity purposiveness without art is as it

were the style of nature in the sublime and so also

of morality which is a second supersensible nature

of which we only know the laws without being able

to reach by intuition that supersensible faculty in ourselves

which contains the ground of the legislation
now the satisfaction in the beautiful like that in

the sublime is not alone distinguishable from other

aesthetical judgements by its universal communicability

but also because through this very property

it acquires an interest in reference to society in

which this communication is possible we must

however remark that separation from all society is

regarded as sublime if it rests upon ideas that overlook

all sensible interest to be sufficient for oneself

and consequently to have no need of society

without at the same time being unsociable ie

without flying from it is something bordering on

the sublime as is any dispensing with wants on

the other hand to fly from men from misanthropy

because we bear illwill to them or from anthropophoby

shyness because we fear them as foes is

partly hateful partly contemptible there is indeed

a misanthropy very improperly socalled the

tendency to which frequently appears with old age

in many rightthinking men which is philanthropic146

enough as far as goodwill to men is concerned but

which through long and sad experience is far removed

from satisfaction with men evidence of this is

afforded by the propensity to solitude the fantastic

wish for a secluded country seat or in the case of

young persons by the dream of the happiness of

passing ones life with a little family upon some

island unknown to the rest of the world a dream

of which storytellers or writers of robinsonades

know how to make good use falsehood ingratitude

injustice the childishness of the purposes

regarded by ourselves as important and great in

the pursuit of which men inflict upon each other all

imaginable evils are so contradictory to the idea of

what men might be if they would and conflict so

with our lively wish to see them better that in

order that we may not hate them since we cannot

love them the renunciation of all social joys seems

but a small sacrifice this sadnessnot the sadness

of which sympathy is the cause for the evils

which fate brings upon othersbut for those things

which men do to one another which depends upon

an antipathy in fundamental propositions is sublime

because it rests upon ideas whilst the former can

only count as beautifulthe brilliant and thorough

saussure60 in his account of his alpine travels says

of one of the savoy mountains called bonhomme

there reigns there a certain insipid sadness he

therefore recognised an interesting sadness that the

sight of a solitude might inspire to which men

might wish to transport themselves that they might

neither hear nor experience any more of the world

which however would not be quite so inhospitable

that it would offer only an extremely painful retreat147i

make this remark solely with the design of indicating

again that even depression not dejected

sadness may be counted among the sturdy affections

if it has its ground in moral ideas but if it is

grounded on sympathy and as such is amiable it

belongs merely to the languid affections i make

this remark to call attention to the state of mind

which is sublime only in the first case
    
we can now compare the above transcendental

exposition of aesthetical judgements with the

physiological worked out by burke and by many

clearheaded men among us in order to see whither

a merely empirical exposition of the sublime and

beautiful leads burke who deserves to be regarded

as the most important author who adopts

this mode of treatment infers by this method that

the feeling of the sublime rests on the impulse towards

selfpreservation and on fear ie on a pain

which not going so far as actually to derange the

parts of the body produces movements which since

they purify the finer or grosser vessels of dangerous

or troublesome stoppages are capable of exciting

pleasant sensations not indeed pleasure but a kind

of satisfying horror a certain tranquillity tinged

with terror61 the beautiful which he founded on148

love which he wishes to keep quite separate from

desire he reduces to the relaxing slackening and

enervating of the fibres of the body and a consequent

weakening languor and exhaustion a fainting

dissolving and melting away for enjoyment62

and he confirms this explanation not only by cases

in which the imagination in combination with the

understanding can excite in us the feeling of the

beautiful or of the sublime but by cases in which

it is combined with sensationas psychological

observations these analyses of the phenomena of

our mind are exceedingly beautiful and afford rich

material for the favourite investigations of empirical

anthropology it is also not to be denied that all

representations in us whether objectively viewed

they are merely sensible or are quite intellectual

may yet subjectively be united to gratification or

grief however imperceptible either may be because

they all affect the feeling of life and none of them

so far as it is a modification of the subject can be

indifferent and so as epicurus maintained all

gratification or grief may ultimately be corporeal

whether it arises from the representations of the

imagination or the understanding because life

without a feeling of bodily organs would be merely

a consciousness of existence without any feeling of

wellbeing or the reverse ie of the furthering or

the checking of the vital powers for the mind

is by itself alone life the principle of life and

hindrances or furtherances must be sought outside149

it and yet in the man consequently in union with

his body
if however we place the satisfaction in the

object altogether in the fact that it gratifies us by

charm or emotion we must not assume that any

other man agrees with the aesthetical judgement

which we pass for as to these each one rightly

consults his own individual sensibility but in that

case all censorship of taste would disappear except

indeed the example afforded by the accidental agreement

of others in their judgements were regarded

as commanding our assent and this principle we

should probably resist and should appeal to the

natural right of subjecting the judgement which

rests on the immediate feeling of our own wellbeing

to our own sense and not to that of any

other man
if then the judgement of taste is not to be valid

merely egoistically but according to its inner natureie

on account of itself and not on account of the

examples that others give of their tasteto be

necessarily valid pluralistically if we regard it as a

judgement which may exact the adhesion of every

one then there must lie at its basis some a priori

principle whether objective or subjective to which

we can never attain by seeking out the empirical

laws of mental changes for these only enable us

to know how we judge but do not prescribe to us

how we ought to judge they do not supply an

unconditioned command63 such as judgements of

taste presuppose inasmuch as they require that

the satisfaction be immediately connected with the

representation thus the empirical exposition of

aesthetical judgements may be a beginning of a150

collection of materials for a higher investigation

but a transcendental discussion of this faculty is also

possible and is an essential part of the critique of

taste for if it had not a priori principles it could

not possibly pass sentence on the judgements of

others and it could not approve or blame them

with any appearance of right
the remaining part of the analytic of the

aesthetical judgement contains first the
deduction of pure64 aesthetical judgements
 30 the deduction of aesthetical judgements on the

objects of nature must not be directed to what

we call sublime in nature but only to the

beautiful
the claim of an aesthetical judgement to universal

validity for every subject requires as a judgement

resting on some a priori principle a deduction

or legitimatising of its pretensions in addition to

its exposition if it is concerned with satisfaction

or dissatisfaction in the form of the object of this

kind are judgements of taste about the beautiful in

nature for in that case the purposiveness has its

ground in the object and in its figure although it

does not indicate the reference of this to other objects

according to concepts for a cognitive judgement

but merely has to do in general with the apprehension

of this form so far as it shows itself conformable

in the mind to the faculty of concepts and

to that of their presentation which is identical with

that of apprehension we can thus in respect of

the beautiful in nature suggest many questions151

touching the cause of this purposiveness of their

forms eg to explain why nature has scattered

abroad beauty with such profusion even in the

depth of the ocean where the human eye for

which alone that purposiveness exists but seldom

penetrates
but the sublime in natureif we are passing

upon it a pure aesthetical judgement not mixed up

with any concepts of perfection or objective purposiveness

in which case it would be a teleological

judgementmay be regarded as quite formless or

devoid of figure and yet as the object of a pure

satisfaction and it may display a subjective purposiveness

in the given representation and we

ask if for an aesthetical judgement of this kindover

and above the exposition of what is thought

in ita deduction also of its claim to any subjective

a priori principle may be demanded
to which we may answer that the sublime in

nature is improperly so called and that properly

speaking the word should only be applied to a

state of mind or rather to its foundation in

human nature the apprehension of an otherwise

formless and unpurposive object gives merely the

occasion through which we become conscious of

such a state the object is thus employed as

subjectively purposive but is not judged as such

in itself and on account of its form it is as it were

a species finalis accepta non data hence our

exposition of judgements concerning the sublime

in nature was at the same time their deduction

for when we analysed the reflection of the judgement

in such acts we found in them a purposive

relation of the cognitive faculties which must be

ascribed ultimately to the faculty of purposes the152

will and hence is itself purposive a priori this

then immediately involves the deduction ie the

justification of the claim of such a judgement to

universal and necessary validity
we shall therefore only have to seek for the

deduction of judgements of taste ie of judgements

about the beauty of natural things we shall thus

treat satisfactorily the problem with which the whole

faculty of aesthetical judgement is concerned
 31 of the method of deduction of judgements

of taste
a deduction ie the guarantee of the legitimacy

of a class of judgements is only obligatory if the

judgement lays claim to necessity this it does if

it demands even subjective universality or the agreement

of every one although it is not a judgement

of cognition but only one of pleasure or pain in a

given object ie it assumes a subjective purposiveness

thoroughly valid for every one which must

not be based on any concept of the thing because

the judgement is one of taste
we have before us in the latter case no cognitive

judgementneither a theoretical one based on the

concept of a nature in general formed by the

understanding nor a pure practical one based on

the idea of freedom as given a priori by reason

therefore we have to justify a priori the validity

neither of a judgement which represents what a

thing is nor of one which prescribes that i ought

to do something in order to produce it we have

merely to prove for the judgement generally the

universal validity of a singular judgement that expresses

the subjective purposiveness of an empirical153

representation of the form of an object in order

to explain how it is possible that a thing can please

in the mere act of judging it without sensation or

concept and how the satisfaction of one man can

be proclaimed as a rule for every other just as the

act of judging of an object for the sake of a cognition

in general has universal rules
if now this universal validity is not to be based

on any collecting of the suffrages of others or on

any questioning of them as to the kind of sensations

they have but is to rest as it were on an autonomy

of the judging subject in respect of the feeling of

pleasure in the given representation ie on his

own taste and yet is not to be derived from concepts

then a judgement like thissuch as the

judgement of taste is in facthas a twofold logical

peculiarity first there is its a priori universal

validity which is not a logical universality in accordance

with concepts but the universality of a

singular judgement secondly it has a necessity

which must always rest on a priori grounds

which however does not depend on any a priori

grounds of proof through the representation of

which the assent that every one concedes to the

judgement of taste could be exacted
the solution of these logical peculiarities

wherein a judgement of taste is different from all

cognitive judgementsif we at the outset abstract

from all content viz from the feeling of pleasure

and merely compare the aesthetical form with the

form of objective judgements as logic prescribes itis

sufficient by itself for the deduction of this

singular faculty we shall then represent and

elucidate by examples these characteristic properties

of taste
154
 32 first peculiarity of the judgement of taste
the judgement of taste determines its object in

respect of satisfaction in its beauty with an accompanying

claim for the assent of every one just

as if it were objective
to say that this flower is beautiful is the

same as to assert its proper claim to satisfy every

one by the pleasantness of its smell it has no

such claim a smell which one man enjoys gives

another a headache now what are we to presume

from this except that beauty is to be regarded as

a property of the flower itself which does not

accommodate itself to any diversity of persons or

of their sensitive organs but to which these must

accommodate themselves if they are to pass any

judgement upon it and yet this is not so for

a judgement of taste consists in calling a thing

beautiful just because of that characteristic in respect

of which it accommodates itself to our mode of

apprehension
moreover it is required of every judgement which

is to prove the taste of the subject that the subject

shall judge by himself without needing to grope

about empirically among the judgements of others

and acquaint himself previously as to their satisfaction

or dissatisfaction with the same object thus

his judgement should be pronounced a priori and

not be a mere imitation because the thing actually

gives universal pleasure one would think however

that an a priori judgement must contain a

concept of the object for the cognition of which

it contains the principle but the judgement of taste

is not based upon concepts at all and is in general

not a cognitive but an aesthetical judgement
155

thus a young poet does not permit himself to

be dissuaded from his conviction that his poem is

beautiful by the judgement of the public or of his

friends and if he gives ear to them he does so

not because he now judges differently but because

although in regard to him the whole public has

false taste in his desire for applause he finds reason

for accommodating himself to the common error

even against his judgement it is only at a later

time when his judgement has been sharpened by

exercise that he voluntarily departs from his former

judgements just as he proceeds with those of his

judgements which rest upon reason taste

merely65 claims autonomy to make the judgements

of others the determining grounds of his own

would be heteronomy
that we and rightly recommend the works of

the ancients as models and call their authors classical

thus forming among writers a kind of noble class

who give laws to the people by their example seems

to indicate a posteriori sources of taste and to contradict

the autonomy of taste in every subject but

we might just as well say that the old mathematicianswho

are regarded up to the present day as supplying

models not easily to be dispensed with for the

supreme profundity and elegance of their synthetical

methodsprove that our reason is only imitative

and that we have not the faculty of producing from

it in combination with intuition rigid proofs by

means of the construction of concepts66 there is

no use of our powers however free no use of

reason itself which must create all its judgements156
a priori from common sources which would not

give rise to faulty attempts if every subject had

always to begin anew from the rude basis of his

natural state and if others had not preceded him

with their attempts not that these make mere

imitators of those who come after them but rather

by their procedure they put others on the track

of seeking in themselves principles and so of pursuing

their own course often a better one even in

religionwhere certainly every one has to derive

the rule of his conduct from himself because he

remains responsible for it and cannot shift the

blame of his transgressions upon others whether

his teachers or his predecessorsthere is never

as much accomplished by means of universal precepts

either obtained from priests or philosophers

or got from oneself as by means of an example

of virtue or holiness which exhibited in history

does not dispense with the autonomy of virtue

based on the proper and original idea of morality

a priori or change it into a mechanical imitation

following involving something precedent not

imitation is the right expression for all influence

that the products of an exemplary author may

have upon others and this only means that we

draw from the same sources as our predecessor

did and learn from him only the way to avail

ourselves of them but of all faculties and talents

taste because its judgement is not determinable by

concepts and precepts is just that one which most

needs examples of what has in the progress of culture

received the longest approval that it may not

become again uncivilised and return to the crudeness

of its first essays
157
 33 second peculiarity of the judgement of taste
the judgement of taste is not determinable by

grounds of proof just as if it were merely subjective
if a man in the first place does not find a building

a prospect or a poem beautiful a hundred voices

all highly praising it will not force his inmost agreement

he may indeed feign that it pleases him in

order that he may not be regarded as devoid of

taste he may even begin to doubt whether he has

formed his taste on a knowledge of a sufficient

number of objects of a certain kind just as one

who believes that he recognises in the distance as a

forest something which all others regard as a town

doubts the judgement of his own sight but he

clearly sees that the agreement of others gives no

valid proof of the judgement about beauty others

might perhaps see and observe for him and what

many have seen in one way although he believes

that he has seen it differently might serve him as

an adequate ground of proof of a theoretical and

consequently logical judgement but that a thing

has pleased others could never serve as the basis

of an aesthetical judgement a judgement of others

which is unfavourable to ours may indeed rightly

make us scrutinise our own with care but it can

never convince us of its incorrectness there is

therefore no empirical ground of proof which would

force a judgement of taste upon any one
still less in the second place can an a priori

proof determine according to definite rules a judgement

about beauty if a man reads me a poem of

his or brings me to a play which does not after

all suit my taste he may bring forward in proof158

of the beauty of his poem batteux67 or lessing or

still more ancient and famous critics of taste and

all the rules laid down by them certain passages

which displease me may agree very well with rules

of beauty as they have been put forth by these

writers and are universally recognised but i stop

my ears i will listen to no arguments and no

reasoning and i will rather assume that these rules

of the critics are false or at least that they do not

apply to the case in question than admit that my

judgement should be determined by grounds of proof

a priori for it is to be a judgement of taste and

not of understanding or reason
it seems that this is one of the chief reasons

why this aesthetical faculty of judgement has been

given the name of taste for though a man

enumerate to me all the ingredients of a dish and

remark that each is separately pleasant to me and

further extol with justice the wholesomeness of this

particular foodyet am i deaf to all these reasons

i try the dish with my tongue and my palate and

thereafter and not according to universal principles

do i pass my judgement
in fact the judgement of taste always takes the

form of a singular judgement about an object the

understanding can form a universal judgement by

comparing the object in point of the satisfaction it

affords with the judgement of others upon it eg

all tulips are beautiful but then this is not a

judgement of taste but a logical judgement which

takes the relation of an object to taste as the

predicate of things of a certain species that

judgement however in which i find an individual159

given tulip beautiful ie in which i find my satisfaction

in it to be universally valid is alone a

judgement of taste its peculiarity consists in the

fact that although it has merely subjective validity

it claims the assent of all subjects exactly as it

would do if it were an objective judgement resting

on grounds of knowledge that could be established

by a proof
 34 there is no objective principle of taste

possible
by a principle of taste i mean a principle under

the condition of which we could subsume the concept

of an object and thus infer by means of a

syllogism that the object is beautiful but that is

absolutely impossible for i must feel the pleasure

immediately in the representation of the object

and of that i can be persuaded by no grounds of

proof whatever although as hume says68 all critics

can reason more plausibly than cooks yet the same

fate awaits them they cannot expect the determining

ground of their judgement to be derived

from the force of the proofs but only from the

reflection of the subject upon its own proper state

of pleasure or pain all precepts and rules being

rejected
but although critics can and ought to pursue160

their reasonings so that our judgements of taste may

be corrected and extended it is not with a view to

set forth the determining ground of this kind of

aesthetical judgements in a universally applicable

formula which is impossible but rather to investigate

the cognitive faculties and their exercise in

these judgements and to explain by examples the

reciprocal subjective purposiveness the form of

which as has been shown above in a given representation

constitutes the beauty of the object

therefore the critique of taste is only subjective

as regards the representation through which an

object is given to us viz it is the art or

science of reducing to rules the reciprocal relation

between the understanding and the imagination

in the given representation without reference to

any preceding sensation or concept that is it

is the art or science of reducing to rules their accordance

or discordance and of determining them with

regard to their conditions it is an art if it only

shows this by examples it is a science if it derives

the possibility of such judgements from the nature

of these faculties as cognitive faculties in general

we have here in transcendental criticism only to do

with the latter it should develop and justify the

subjective principle of taste as an a priori principle

of the judgement this critique as an art merely

seeks to apply in the judging of objects the physiological

here psychological and therefore empirical

rules according to which taste actually proceeds

without taking any account of their possibility

and it criticises the products of beautiful art just as

regarded as a science it criticises the faculty by

which they are judged
161
 35 the principle of taste is the subjective

principle of judgement in general
the judgement of taste is distinguished from a

logical judgement in this that the latter subsumes

a representation under the concept of the object

while the former does not subsume it under any

concept because otherwise the necessary universal

agreement in these judgements would be capable

of being enforced by proofs nevertheless it is

like the latter in this that it claims universality and

necessity though not according to concepts of the

object and consequently a merely subjective necessity

now because the concepts in a judgement

constitute its content what belongs to the cognition

of the object but the judgement of taste is not

determinable by concepts it is based only on the

subjective formal condition of a judgement in general

the subjective condition of all judgements is the

faculty of judgement itself this when used with

reference to a representation by which an object is

given requires the accordance of two representative

powers viz imagination for the intuition and

comprehension of the manifold and understanding

for the concept as a representation of the unity of

this comprehension now because no concept of

the object lies here at the basis of the judgement

it can only consist in the subsumption of the

imagination itself in the case of a representation

by which an object is given under the conditions

that the understanding requires to pass from intuition

to concepts that is because the freedom of the

imagination consists in the fact that it schematises

without any concept the judgement of taste must

rest on a mere sensation of the reciprocal activity of162

the imagination in its freedom and the understanding

with its conformity to law it must therefore

rest on a feeling which makes us judge the object

by the purposiveness of the representation by

which an object is given in respect of the

furtherance of the cognitive faculty in its free play

taste then as subjective judgement contains a

principle of subsumption not of intuitions under

concepts but of the faculty of intuitions or presentations

ie the imagination under the faculty

of the concepts ie the understanding so far as

the former in its freedom harmonises with the latter

in its conformity to law
in order to discover this ground of legitimacy

by a deduction of the judgements of taste we can

only take as a clue the formal peculiarities of this

kind of judgements and consequently can only consider

their logical form
 36 of the problem of a deduction of judgements

of taste
the concept of an object in general can immediately

be combined with the perception of an

object containing its empirical predicates so as

to form a cognitive judgement and it is thus that a

judgement of experience is produced69 at the basis

of this lie a priori concepts of the synthetical

unity of the manifold of intuition by which the

manifold is thought as the determination of an

object these concepts the categories require a

deduction which is given in the critique of pure163

reason and by it we can get the solution of the

problem how are synthetical a priori cognitive

judgements possible this problem concerns then

the a priori principles of the pure understanding

and its theoretical judgements
but with a perception there can also be combined

a feeling of pleasure or pain and a satisfaction

that accompanies the representation of the

object and serves instead of its predicate thus

there can result an aesthetical noncognitive judgement

at the basis of such a judgementif it is

not a mere judgement of sensation but a formal

judgement of reflection which imputes the same

satisfaction necessarily to every onemust lie some

a priori principle which may be merely subjective

if an objective one should prove impossible for

judgements of this kind but also as such may

need a deduction that we may thereby comprehend

how an aesthetical judgement can lay claim to

necessity on this is founded the problem with

which we are now occupied how are judgements of

taste possible this problem then has to do with

the a priori principles of the pure faculty of judgement

in aesthetical judgements ie judgements in

which it has not as in theoretical ones merely to

subsume under objective concepts of understanding

and in which it is subject to a law but in which it

is itself subjectively both object and law
this problem then may be thus represented

how is a judgement possible in which merely from

our own feeling of pleasure in an object independently

of its concept we judge that this pleasure

attaches to the representation of the same object

in every other subject and that a priori without

waiting for the accordance of others
164

it is easy to see that judgements of taste are

synthetical because they go beyond the concept

and even beyond the intuition of the object and

add to that intuition as predicate something that is

not a cognition viz a feeling of pleasure or pain

although the predicate of the personal pleasure

bound up with the representation is empirical nevertheless

as concerns the required assent of every one

the judgements are a priori or desire to be regarded

as such and this is already involved in the

expressions of this claim thus this problem of the

critique of judgement belongs to the general

problem of transcendental philosophy how are synthetical

a priori judgements possible
 37 what is properly asserted a priori of an

object in a judgement of taste
that the representation of an object is immediately

bound up with pleasure can only be internally

perceived and if we did not wish to indicate

anything more than this it would give a merely

empirical judgement for i cannot combine a

definite feeling of pleasure or pain with any

representation except where there is at bottom an

a priori principle in the reason determining the

will in that case the pleasure in the moral

feeling is the consequence of the principle but

cannot be compared with the pleasure in taste

because it requires a definite concept of a law and

the latter pleasure on the contrary must be

bound up with the mere act of judging prior

to all concepts hence also all judgements of

taste are singular judgements because they do

not combine their predicate of satisfaction with a165

concept but with a given individual empirical representation
and so it is not the pleasure but the universal

validity of this pleasure perceived as mentally

bound up with the mere judgement upon an object

which is represented a priori in a judgement of

taste as a universal rule for the judgement and valid

for every one it is an empirical judgement to say

that i perceive and judge an object with pleasure

but it is an a priori judgement to say that i find it

beautiful ie i attribute this satisfaction necessarily

to every one
 38 deduction of judgements of taste
if it be admitted that in a pure judgement of

taste the satisfaction in the object is combined with

the mere act of judging its form it is nothing else

than its subjective purposiveness for the judgement

which we feel to be mentally combined with the

representation of the object the judgement as

regards the formal rules of its action apart from all

matter whether sensation or concept can only be

directed to the subjective conditions of its employment

in general it is applied70 neither to a particular

mode of sense nor to a particular concept of the

understanding and consequently to that subjective

element which we can presuppose in all men as

requisite for possible cognition in general thus

the agreement of a representation with these conditions

of the judgement must be capable of being

assumed as valid a priori for every one ie we

may rightly impute to every one the pleasure or the

subjective purposiveness of the representation for166

the relation between the cognitive faculties in the

act of judging a sensible object in general71
remark
this deduction is thus easy because it has no

need to justify the objective reality of any concept

for beauty is not a concept of the object and the

judgement of taste is not cognitive it only maintains

that we are justified in presupposing universally

in every man those subjective conditions of the

judgement which we find in ourselves and further

that we have rightly subsumed the given object

under these conditions the latter has indeed

unavoidable difficulties which do not beset the

logical judgement there we subsume under concepts

but in the aesthetical judgement under a

merely sensible relation between the imagination

and understanding mutually harmonising in the

representation of the form of the objectin which

case the subsumption may easily be fallacious yet

the legitimacy of the claim of the judgement in

counting upon universal assent is not thus annulled

it reduces itself merely to the correctness of the

principle of judging validly for every one from167

subjective grounds for as to the difficulty or

doubt concerning the correctness of the subsumption

under that principle it makes the legitimacy of the

claim of an aesthetical judgement in general to such

validity and the principle of the same as little

doubtful as the like faulty though neither so

commonly nor readily faulty subsumption of the

logical judgement under its principle can make the

latter an objective principle doubtful but if the

question were to be how is it possible to assume

nature a priori to be a complex of objects of taste

this problem has reference to teleology because it

must be regarded as a purpose of nature essentially

belonging to its concept to exhibit forms that are

purposive for our judgement but the correctness

of this latter assumption is very doubtful whereas

the efficacy of natural beauties is patent to experience
 39 of the communicability of a sensation
if sensation as the real in perception is related

to knowledge it is called sensation of the senses

and its specific quality may be represented as generally

communicable in a uniform way if we assume

that every one has senses like our own but this

cannot at all be presupposed of any single sensation

to a man who is deficient in the sense of smell

this kind of sensation cannot be communicated

and even if it is not wholly deficient we cannot

be certain that he gets exactly the same sensation

from a flower that we have but even more must

we represent men as differing in respect of the

pleasantness or unpleasantness involved in the sensation

from the same object of sense and it is

absolutely not to be required that every man should168

take pleasure in the same objects pleasure of this

kind because it comes into the mind through the

senses in respect of which therefore we are passive

we may call the pleasure of enjoyment
satisfaction in an action because of its moral

character is on the other hand not the pleasure of

enjoyment but of spontaneity and its accordance

with the idea of its destination but this feeling

called moral requires concepts and presents not free

purposiveness but purposiveness that is conformable

to law it therefore admits of being universally

communicated only by means of reason and if the

pleasure is to be homogeneous for every one by

very definite practical concepts of reason
pleasure in the sublime in nature regarded as

a pleasure of rational contemplation also makes

claim to universal participation but it presupposes

besides a different feeling viz that of our supersensible

destination which however obscurely has

a moral foundation but that other men will take

account of it and will find a satisfaction in the consideration

of the wild greatness of nature that

certainly cannot be ascribed to its aspect which is

rather terrifying i am not absolutely justified in

supposing nevertheless in consideration of the

fact that on every suitable occasion regard should be

had to these moral dispositions i can impute such

satisfaction to every man but only by means of the

moral law which on its side again is based on

concepts of reason
on the contrary pleasure in the beautiful is

neither a pleasure of enjoyment nor of a lawabiding

activity nor even of rational contemplation in

accordance with ideas but of mere reflection without

having as rule any purpose or fundamental169

proposition this pleasure accompanies the ordinary

apprehension of an object by the imagination as

faculty of intuition in relation with the understanding

as faculty of concepts by means of a procedure

of the judgement which it must also exercise on

behalf of the commonest experience only that in

the latter case it is in order to perceive an empirical

objective concept in the former case in aesthetical

judgements merely to perceive the accordance of the

representation with the harmonious subjectively

purposive activity of both cognitive faculties in their

freedom ie to feel with pleasure the mental state

produced by the representation this pleasure

must necessarily depend for every one on the same

conditions for they are subjective conditions of the

possibility of a cognition in general and the proportion

between these cognitive faculties requisite

for taste is also requisite for that ordinary sound

understanding which we have to presuppose in

every one therefore he who judges with taste if

only he does not go astray in this act of consciousness

and mistake matter for form or charm for

beauty may impute to every one subjective purposiveness

ie his satisfaction in the object and may

assume his feeling to be universally communicable

and that without the mediation of concepts
 40 of taste as a kind of sensus communis
we often give to the judgement if we are considering

the result rather than the act of its reflection

the name of a sense and we speak of a sense of

truth or of a sense of decorum of justice etc and

yet we know or at least we ought to know that

these concepts cannot have their place in sense and170

further that sense has not the least capacity for

expressing universal rules but that no representation

of truth fitness beauty or justice and so forth

could come into our thoughts if we could not rise

beyond sense to higher faculties of cognition the

common understanding of men which as the mere

sound not yet cultivated understanding we regard

as the least to be expected from any one claiming the

name of man has therefore the doubtful honour of

being given the name of common sense sensus communis

and in such a way that by the name

common not merely in our language where the word

actually has a double signification but in many

others we understand vulgar that which is everywhere

met with the possession of which indicates

absolutely no merit or superiority
but under the sensus communis we must include

the idea of a communal sense ie of a faculty of

judgement which in its reflection takes account

a priori of the mode of representation of all other

men in thought in order as it were to compare its

judgement with the collective reason of humanity

and thus to escape the illusion arising from the

private conditions that could be so easily taken for

objective which would injuriously affect the judgement

this is done by comparing our judgement

with the possible rather than the actual judgements

of others and by putting ourselves in the place of

any other man by abstracting from the limitations

which contingently attach to our own judgement

this again is brought about by leaving aside as

much as possible the matter of our representative

state ie sensation and simply having respect to

the formal peculiarities of our representation or

representative state now this operation of reflection171

seems perhaps too artificial to be attributed

to the faculty called common sense but it only

appears so when expressed in abstract formulae

in itself there is nothing more natural than to

abstract from charm or emotion if we are seeking a

judgement that is to serve as a universal rule
the following maxims of common human understanding

do not properly come in here as parts of

the critique of taste but yet they may serve to

elucidate its fundamental propositions they are

1 to think for oneself 2 to put ourselves in thought

in the place of every one else 3 always to think

consistently the first is the maxim of unprejudiced

thought the second of enlarged thought the third

of consecutive thought72 the first is the maxim of

a reason never passive the tendency to such

passivity and therefore to heteronomy of the

reason is called prejudice and the greatest prejudice

of all is to represent nature as not subject

to the rules that the understanding places at its

basis by means of its own essential law ie is

superstition deliverance from superstition is called

enlightenment73 because although this name belongs

to deliverance from prejudices in general

yet superstition specially in sensu eminenti deserves

to be called a prejudice for the blindness172

in which superstition places us which it even imposes

on us as an obligation makes the need of

being guided by others and the consequent passive

state of our reason peculiarly noticeable as

regards the second maxim of the mind we are

otherwise wont to call him limited born the

opposite of enlarged whose talents attain to no

great use especially as regards intensity but

here we are not speaking of the faculty of cognition

but of the mode of thought which makes a purposive

use thereof however small may be the area or the

degree to which a mans natural gifts reach yet it

indicates a man of enlarged thought if he disregards

the subjective private conditions of his own judgement

by which so many others are confined and

reflects upon it from a universal standpoint which

he can only determine by placing himself at the

standpoint of others the third maxim viz that

of consecutive thought is the most difficult to attain

and can only be attained by the combination of both

the former and after the constant observance of

them has grown into a habit we may say that

the first of these maxims is the maxim of understanding

the second of judgement and the third of

reason
i take up again the threads interrupted by this

digression and i say that taste can be called sensus

communis with more justice than sound understanding

can and that the aesthetical judgement

rather than the intellectual may bear the name of a

communal sense74 if we are willing to use the word

sense of an effect of mere reflection upon the

mind for then we understand by sense the feeling173

of pleasure we could even define taste as the

faculty of judging of that which makes universally

communicable without the mediation of a concept

our feeling in a given representation
the skill that men have in communicating their

thoughts requires also a relation between the imagination

and the understanding in order to associate

intuitions with concepts and concepts again with

those concepts which then combine in a cognition

but in that case the agreement of the two mental

powers is according to law under the constraint of

definite concepts only where the imagination in

its freedom awakens the understanding and is put

by it into regular play without the aid of concepts

does the representation communicate itself not as a

thought but as an internal feeling of a purposive

state of the mind
taste is then the faculty of judging a priori of

the communicability of feelings that are bound up

with a given representation without the mediation

of a concept
if we could assume that the mere universal

communicability of a feeling must carry in itself an

interest for us with it which however we are not

justified in concluding from the character of a

merely reflective judgement we should be able

to explain why the feeling in the judgement of taste

comes to be imputed to every one so to speak as

a duty
 41 of the empirical interest in the beautiful
that the judgement of taste by which something

is declared beautiful must have no interest as its

determining ground has been sufficiently established

above but it does not follow that after it has been174

given as a pure aesthetical judgement no interest can

be combined with it this combination however

can only be indirect ie taste must first of all be

represented as combined with something else in

order that we may unite with the satisfaction of

mere reflection upon an object a pleasure in its

existence as that wherein all interest consists for

here also in aesthetical judgements what we say in

cognitive judgements of things in general is valid

a posse ad esse non valet consequentia this

something else may be empirical viz an inclination

proper to human nature or intellectual as the

property of the will of being capable of a priori

determination by reason both these involve a

satisfaction in the presence of an object and so can

lay the foundation for an interest in what has by

itself pleased without reference to any interest

whatever
empirically the beautiful interests only in

society if we admit the impulse to society as natural

to man and his fitness for it and his propension

towards it ie sociability as a requisite for man as

a being destined for society and so as a property

belonging to humanity we cannot escape from

regarding taste as a faculty for judging everything

in respect of which we can communicate

our feeling to all other men and so as a means of

furthering that which every ones natural inclination

desires
a man abandoned by himself on a desert island

would adorn neither his hut nor his person nor

would he seek for flowers still less would he plant

them in order to adorn himself therewith it is

only in society that it occurs to him to be not merely

a man but a refined man after his kind the beginning175

of civilisation for such do we judge him

to be who is both inclined and apt to communicate

his pleasure to others and who is not contented

with an object if he cannot feel satisfaction in it in

common with others again every one expects and

requires from every one else this reference to universal

communication of pleasure as it were from an

original compact dictated by humanity itself thus

doubtless in the beginning only those things which

attracted the senses eg colours for painting

oneself roucou among the carabs and cinnabar

among the iroquois flowers mussel shells

beautiful feathers etcbut in time beautiful forms

also eg in their canoes and clothes etc which

bring with them no gratification or satisfaction of

enjoymentwere important in society and were

combined with great interest until at last

civilisation having reached its highest point makes

out of this almost the main business of refined inclination

and sensations are only regarded as of

worth in so far as they can be universally communicated

here although the pleasure which every

one has in such an object is inconsiderable and in

itself without any marked interest yet the idea of

its universal communicability increases its worth in

an almost infinite degree
but this interest that indirectly attaches to the

beautiful through our inclination to society and

consequently is empirical is of no importance for us

here because we have only to look to what may

have a reference although only indirectly to the

judgement of taste a priori for if even in this

form an interest bound up therewith should discover

itself taste would discover a transition of our judging

faculty from senseenjoyment to moral feeling176

and so not only would we be the better guided in

employing taste purposively but there would be

thus presented a link in the chain of the human

faculties a priori on which all legislation must

depend we can only say thus much about the

empirical interest in objects of taste and in taste

itself since it is subservient to inclination however

refined the latter may be it may easily be

confounded with all the inclinations and passions

which attain their greatest variety and highest

degree in society and the interest in the beautiful

if it is grounded thereon can only furnish a very

ambiguous transition from the pleasant to the good

but whether this can or cannot be furthered by

taste taken in its purity is what we now have to

investigate
 42 of the intellectual interest in the beautiful
with the best intentions those persons who

refer all activities to which their inner natural

dispositions impel men to the final purpose of

humanity viz the morally good have regarded the

taking an interest in the beautiful in general as a

mark of good moral character but it is not without

reason that they have been contradicted by

others who rely on experience for this shows that

connoisseurs in taste not only often but generally

are given up to idle capricious and mischievous

passions and that they could perhaps make less

claim than others to any preeminent attachment

to moral principles thus it would seem that the

feeling for the beautiful is not only as actually is

the case specifically different from the moral feeling

but that the interest which can be bound up with it177

is hardly compatible with moral interest and

certainly has no inner affinity therewith
now i admit at once that the interest in the

beautiful of art under which i include the

artificial use of natural beauties for adornment and

so for vanity furnishes no proof whatever of a

disposition attached to the morally good or even

inclined thereto but on the other hand i maintain

that to take an immediate interest in the beauty of

nature not merely to have taste in judging it is

always a mark of a good soul and that when this

interest is habitual it at least indicates a frame of

mind favourable to the moral feeling if it is voluntarily

bound up with the contemplation of nature

it is to be remembered however that i here speak

strictly of the beautiful forms of nature and i set

aside the charms that she is wont to combine so

abundantly with them because though the interest

in the latter is indeed immediate it is only empirical
he who by himself and without any design of

communicating his observations to others regards

the beautiful figure of a wild flower a bird an

insect etc with admiration and lovewho would

not willingly miss it in nature although it may

bring him some hurt who still less wants any

advantage from ithe takes an immediate and also

an intellectual interest in the beauty of nature

ie it is not merely the form of the product of

nature which pleases him but its very presence

pleases him the charms of sense having no share

in this pleasure and no purpose whatever being

combined with it
but it is noteworthy that if we secretly deceived

this lover of the beautiful by planting in the ground178

artificial flowers which can be manufactured exactly

like natural ones or by placing artificially carved

birds on the boughs of trees and he discovered the

deceit the immediate interest that he previously took

in them would disappear at once though perhaps

a different interest viz the interest of vanity in

adorning his chamber with them for the eyes of

others would take its place this thought then

must accompany our intuition and reflection on

beauty viz that nature has produced it and on

this alone is based the immediate interest that

we take in it otherwise there remains a mere

judgement of taste either devoid of all interest

or bound up with a mediate interest viz in that

it has reference to society which latter interest

furnishes no certain indications of a morally good

disposition
this superiority of natural to artificial beauty

in that it alone arouses an immediate interest

although as regards form the first may be surpassed

by the second harmonises with the refined and

wellgrounded habit of thought of all men who have

cultivated their moral feeling if a man who has

taste enough to judge of the products of beautiful

art with the greatest accuracy and refinement

willingly leaves a chamber where are to be found

those beauties that minister to vanity or to any

social joys and turns to the beautiful in nature

in order to find as it were delight for his spirit

in a train of thought that he can never completely

evolve we will regard this choice of his with veneration

and attribute to him a beautiful soul to which

no connoisseur or lover of art can lay claim on

account of the interest he takes in his artistic

objectswhat now is the difference in our estimation179

of these two different kinds of objects which

in the judgement of mere taste it is hard to compare

in point of superiority
we have a faculty of mere aesthetical judgement

by which we judge forms without the aid of concepts

and find a satisfaction in this mere act of judgement

this we make into a rule for every one without this

judgement either being based on or producing any

intereston the other hand we have also a

faculty of intellectual judgement which determines

an a priori satisfaction for the mere forms of

practical maxims so far as they are in themselves

qualified for universal legislation this we make

into a law for every one without our judgement

being based on any interest whatever though in this

case it produces such an interest the pleasure or

pain in the former judgement is called that of taste

in the latter that of moral feeling
but it also interests reason that the ideas for

which in moral feeling it arouses an immediate

interest should have objective reality ie that

nature should at least show a trace or give an

indication that it contains in itself some ground for

assuming a regular agreement of its products with

our entirely disinterested satisfaction which we

recognise a priori as a law for every one without

being able to base it upon proofs hence reason

must take an interest in every expression on the

part of nature of an agreement of this kind consequently

the mind cannot ponder upon the beauty

of nature without finding itself at the same time

interested therein but this interest is akin to

moral and he who takes such an interest in the

beauties of nature can do so only in so far as he

previously has firmly established his interest in the180

morally good if therefore the beauty of nature

interests a man immediately we have reason for

attributing to him at least a basis for a good moral

disposition
it will be said that this account of aesthetical

judgements as akin to the moral feeling seems far

too studied to be regarded as the true interpretation

of that cipher through which nature speaks to us

figuratively in her beautiful forms however in the

first place this immediate interest in the beautiful

is actually not common but is peculiar to those

whose mental disposition either has already been

cultivated in the direction of the good or is eminently

susceptible of such cultivation in that case

the analogy between the pure judgement of taste

which independently of any interest causes us to

feel a satisfaction and also represents it a priori

as suitable to humanity in general and the moral

judgement that does the same thing from concepts

without any clear subtle and premeditated reflectionthis

analogy leads to a similar immediate interest

in the objects of the former as in those of the

latter only that in the one case the interest is free

in the other it is based on objective laws to this

is to be added our admiration for nature which

displays itself in its beautiful products as art not

merely by chance but as it were designedly in

accordance with a regular arrangement and as

purposiveness without purpose this latter as we

never meet with it outside ourselves we naturally

seek in ourselves and in fact in that which

constitutes the ultimate purpose of our being viz

our moral destination of this question as to the

ground of the possibility of such natural purposiveness

we shall first speak in the teleology
181

it is easy to explain why the satisfaction in the

pure aesthetical judgement in the case of beautiful

art is not combined with an immediate interest as

it is in the case of beautiful nature for the former

is either such an imitation of the latter that it reaches

the point of deception and then produces the same

effect as natural beauty for which it is taken or

it is an art obviously directed designedly to our

satisfaction in the latter case the satisfaction in the

product would it is true be brought about immediately

by taste but it would be only a mediate interest

in the cause lying at its root viz an art that can

only interest by means of its purpose and never in

itself it will perhaps be said that this is also

the case if an object of nature interests us by its

beauty only so far as it is associated with a moral

idea but it is not the object itself which immediately

interests us but its character in virtue of which

it is qualified for such association which therefore

essentially belongs to it
the charms in beautiful nature which are so

often found as it were blended with beautiful forms

may be referred to modifications either of light

colours or of sound tones for these are the only

sensations that imply not merely a sensible feeling

but also reflection upon the form of these modifications

of sense and thus they involve in themselves

as it were a language by which nature speaks to us

which thus seems to have a higher sense thus the

white colour of lilies seems to determine the mind

to ideas of innocence and the seven colours in

order from the red to the violet seem to suggest the

ideas of 1 sublimity 2 intrepidity 3 candour

4 friendliness 5 modesty 6 constancy 7

tenderness the song of birds proclaims gladsomeness182

and contentment with existence at least

so we interpret nature whether it have this design

or not but the interest which we here take in

beauty has only to do with the beauty of nature

it vanishes altogether as soon as we notice that we

are deceived and that it is only artvanishes so

completely that taste can no longer find the thing

beautiful or sight find it charming what is more

highly praised by poets than the bewitching and

beautiful note of the nightingale in a lonely copse

on a still summer evening by the soft light of the

moon and yet we have instances of a merry host

where no such songster was to be found deceiving

to their great contentment the guests who were

staying with him to enjoy the country air by hiding

in a bush a mischievous boy who knew how to

produce this sound exactly like nature by means of

a reed or a tube in his mouth but as soon as we

are aware that it is a cheat no one will remain long

listening to the song which before was counted

so charming and it is just the same with the

songs of all other birds it must be nature or be

regarded as nature if we are to take an immediate

interest in the beautiful as such and still more is

this the case if we can require that others should

take an interest in it too this happens as a matter

of fact when we regard as coarse and ignoble the

mental attitude of those persons who have no feeling

for beautiful nature for thus we describe a susceptibility

to interest in its contemplation and who

confine themselves to eating and drinkingto the

mere enjoyments of sense
183
 43 of art in general
1 art is distinguished from nature as doing

facere is distinguished from acting or working

generally agere and as the product or result of

the former is distinguished as work opus from the

working effectus of the latter
by right we ought only to describe as art

production through freedom ie through a will

that places reason at the basis of its actions

for although we like to call the product of bees

regularly built cells of wax a work of art this is

only by way of analogy as soon as we feel that

this work of theirs is based on no proper rational

deliberation we say that it is a product of nature

of instinct and as art only ascribe it to their

creator
if as sometimes happens in searching through a

bog we come upon a bit of shaped wood we do not

say this is a product of nature but of art its

producing cause has conceived a purpose to which

the bit of wood owes its form elsewhere too we

should see art in everything which is made so that a

representation of it in its cause must have preceded

its actuality as even in the case of the bees though

the effect could not have been thought by the cause

but if we call anything absolutely a work of art in

order to distinguish it from a natural effect we

always understand by that a work of man
2 art regarded as human skill differs from

science as can from know as a practical faculty does

from a theoretical as technic does from theory as

mensuration from geometry and so what we can

do as soon as we merely know what ought to be184

done and therefore are sufficiently cognisant of the

desired effect is not called art only that which

a man even if he knows it completely may not

therefore have the skill to accomplish belongs to

art camper75 describes very exactly how the best

shoes must be made but he certainly could not

make one76
3 art also differs from handicraft the first is

called free the other may be called mercenary we

regard the first as if it could only prove purposive

as play ie as occupation that is pleasant in itself

but the second is regarded as if it could only be

compulsorily imposed upon one as work ie as

occupation which is unpleasant a trouble in itself

and which is only attractive on account of its effect

eg the wage whether or not in the graded list

of the professions we ought to count watchmakers

as artists but smiths only as handicraftsmen would

require another point of view from which to judge

than that which we are here taking up viz we

should have to consider the proportion of talents

which must be assumed requisite in these several

occupations whether or not again under the socalled

seven free arts some may be included which

ought to be classed as sciences and many that are

akin rather to handicraft i shall not here discuss

but it is not inexpedient to recall that in all free

arts there is yet requisite something compulsory

or as it is called mechanism without which the185
spirit which must be free in art and which alone

inspires the work would have no body and would

evaporate altogether eg in poetry there must be

an accuracy and wealth of language and also

prosody and metre it is not inexpedient i say

to recall this for many modern educators believe

that the best way to produce a free art is to remove

it from all constraint and thus to change it from

work into mere play
 44 of beautiful art
there is no science of the beautiful but only

a critique of it and there is no such thing as

beautiful science but only beautiful art for as

regards the first point if it could be decided

scientifically ie by proofs whether a thing was to

be regarded as beautiful or not the judgement

upon beauty would belong to science and would

not be a judgement of taste and as far as the

second point is concerned a science which should

be beautiful as such is a nonentity for if in such

a science we were to ask for grounds and proofs

we would be put off with tasteful phrases bonmotsthe

source of the common expression

beautiful science is without doubt nothing else than

this as it has been rightly remarked that for

beautiful art in its entire completeness much science

is requisite eg a knowledge of ancient languages

a learned familiarity with classical authors history

a knowledge of antiquities etc and hence these

historical sciences because they form the necessary

preparation and basis for beautiful art and also

partly because under them is included the knowledge

of the products of beautiful art rhetoric and poetry186

have come to be called beautiful sciences by a

confusion of words
if art which is adequate to the cognition of a

possible object performs the actions requisite therefore

merely in order to make it actual it is mechanical

art but if it has for its immediate design the feeling

of pleasure it is called aesthetical art this is

again either pleasant or beautiful it is the first if

its purpose is that the pleasure should accompany

the representations of the object regarded as mere

sensations it is the second if they are regarded as

modes of cognition
pleasant arts are those that are directed merely

to enjoyment of this class are all those charming

arts that can gratify a company at table eg the

art of telling stories in an entertaining way of starting

the company in frank and lively conversation of

raising them by jest and laugh to a certain pitch of

merriment77 when as people say there may be a

great deal of gossip at the feast but no one will be

answerable for what he says because they are only

concerned with momentary entertainment and not

with any permanent material for reflection or subsequent

discussion among these are also to be

reckoned the way of arranging the table for enjoyment

and at great feasts the management of the

music this latter is a wonderful thing it is

meant to dispose to gaiety the minds of the guests

regarded solely as a pleasant noise without any

one paying the least attention to its composition

and it favours the free conversation of each with his187

neighbour again to this class belong all games

which bring with them no further interest than that

of making the time pass imperceptibly
on the other hand beautiful art is a mode of

representation which is purposive for itself and

which although devoid of definite purpose yet

furthers the culture of the mental powers in reference

to social communication
the universal communicability of a pleasure

carries with it in its very concept that the pleasure

is not one of enjoyment from mere sensation but

must be derived from reflection and thus aesthetical

art as the art of beauty has for standard the

reflective judgement and not sensation
 45 beautiful art is an art in so far as it seems

like nature
in a product of beautiful art we must become

conscious that it is art and not nature but yet the

purposiveness in its form must seem to be as free

from all constraint of arbitrary rules as if it were a

product of mere nature on this feeling of freedom

in the play of our cognitive faculties which must

at the same time be purposive rests that pleasure

which alone is universally communicable without

being based on concepts nature is beautiful

because it looks like art and art can only be

called beautiful if we are conscious of it as art

while yet it looks like nature
for whether we are dealing with natural or

with artificial beauty we can say generally that is

beautiful which pleases in the mere act of judging it

not in the sensation of it or by means of a concept

now art has always a definite design of producing188

something but if this something were bare sensation

something merely subjective which is to be

accompanied with pleasure the product would please

in the act of judgement only by mediation of sensible

feeling and again if the design were directed

towards the production of a definite object then

if this were attained by art the object would only

please by means of concepts but in both cases the

art would not please in the mere act of judging ie

it would not please as beautiful but as mechanical
hence the purposiveness in the product of beautiful

art although it is designed must not seem

to be designed ie beautiful art must look like

nature although we are conscious of it as art

but a product of art appears like nature when

although its agreement with the rules according to

which alone the product can become what it ought

to be is punctiliously observed yet this is not painfully

apparent the form of the schools does not

obtrude itself78it shows no trace of the rule

having been before the eyes of the artist and having

fettered his mental powers
 46 beautiful art is the art of genius
genius is the talent or natural gift which gives

the rule to art since talent as the innate productive

faculty of the artist belongs itself to nature

we may express the matter thus genius is the

innate mental disposition ingenium through which

nature gives the rule to art
whatever may be thought of this definition

whether it is merely arbitrary or whether it is

adequate to the concept that we are accustomed to189

combine with the word genius which is to be

examined in the following paragraphs we can

prove already beforehand that according to the

signification of the word here adopted beautiful

arts must necessarily be considered as arts of genius
for every art presupposes rules by means of

which in the first instance a product if it is to be

called artistic is represented as possible but the

concept of beautiful art does not permit the

judgement upon the beauty of a product to be

derived from any rule which has a concept as its

determining ground and therefore has at its basis a

concept of the way in which the product is possible

therefore beautiful art cannot itself devise the rule

according to which it can bring about its product

but since at the same time a product can never be

called art without some precedent rule nature in

the subject must by the harmony of its faculties

give the rule to art ie beautiful art is only possible

as a product of genius
we thus see 1 that genius is a talent for

producing that for which no definite rule can be

given it is not a mere aptitude for what can be

learnt by a rule hence originality must be its

first property 2 but since it also can produce

original nonsense its products must be models ie
exemplary and they consequently ought not to

spring from imitation but must serve as a standard

or rule of judgement for others 3 it cannot

describe or indicate scientifically how it brings about

its products but it gives the rule just as nature

does hence the author of a product for which he

is indebted to his genius does not himself know

how he has come by his ideas and he has not the

power to devise the like at pleasure or in accordance190

with a plan and to communicate it to others in

precepts that will enable them to produce similar

products hence it is probable that the word

genius is derived from genius that peculiar guiding

and guardian spirit given to a man at his birth from

whose suggestion these original ideas proceed

4 nature by the medium of genius does not

prescribe rules to science but to art and to it

only in so far as it is to be beautiful art
 47 elucidation and confirmation of the above

explanation of genius
every one is agreed that genius is entirely

opposed to the spirit of imitation now since

learning is nothing but imitation it follows that

the greatest ability and teachableness capacity

regarded qu teachableness cannot avail for genius

even if a man thinks or invents for himself and

does not merely take in what others have taught

even if he discovers many things in art and science

this is not the right ground for calling such a

perhaps great head a genius as opposed to him

who because he can only learn and imitate is called

a shallowpate for even these things could be

learned they lie in the natural path of him who

investigates and reflects according to rules and

they do not differ specifically from what can be

acquired by industry through imitation thus we

can readily learn all that newton has set forth in

his immortal work on the principles of natural

philosophy however great a head was required to

discover it but we cannot learn to write spirited

poetry however express may be the precepts of the

art and however excellent its models the reason191

is that newton could make all his steps from the

first elements of geometry to his own great and

profound discoveries intuitively plain and definite

as regards consequence not only to himself but to

every one else but a homer or a wieland cannot

show how his ideas so rich in fancy and yet so full

of thought come together in his head simply

because he does not know and therefore cannot

teach others in science then the greatest discoverer

only differs in degree from his laborious

imitator and pupil but he differs specifically from

him whom nature has gifted for beautiful art

and in this there is no depreciation of those great

men to whom the human race owes so much

gratitude as compared with natures favourites in

respect of the talent for beautiful art for in the

fact that the former talent is directed to the everadvancing

greater perfection of knowledge and

every advantage depending on it and at the same

time to the imparting this same knowledge to

othersin this it has a great superiority over the

talent of those who deserve the honour of being

called geniuses for art stands still at a certain

point a boundary is set to it beyond which it

cannot go which presumably has been reached long

ago and cannot be extended further again

artistic skill cannot be communicated it is imparted

to every artist immediately by the hand of nature

and so it dies with him until nature endows another

in the same way so that he only needs an example

in order to put in operation in a similar fashion the

talent of which he is conscious
if now it is a natural gift which must prescribe

its rule to art as beautiful art of what kind is this

rule it cannot be reduced to a formula and serve192

as a precept for then the judgement upon the

beautiful would be determinable according to

concepts but the rule must be abstracted from the

fact ie from the product on which others may try

their own talent by using it as a model not to be

copied but to be imitated how this is possible is

hard to explain the ideas of the artist excite like

ideas in his pupils if nature has endowed them with

a like proportion of their mental powers hence

models of beautiful art are the only means of

handing down these ideas to posterity this

cannot be done by mere descriptions especially not

in the case of the arts of speech and in this latter

classical models are only to be had in the old dead

languages now preserved only as the learned

languages
although mechanical and beautiful art are very

different the first being a mere art of industry and

learning and the second of genius yet there is no

beautiful art in which there is not a mechanical

element that can be comprehended by rules and

followed accordingly and in which therefore there

must be something scholastic as an essential

condition for in every art some purpose must

be conceived otherwise we could not ascribe the

product to art at all and it would be a mere

product of chance but in order to accomplish a

purpose definite rules from which we cannot dispense

ourselves are requisite now since the originality

of the talent constitutes an essential though not the

only element in the character of genius shallow

heads believe that they cannot better show themselves

to be fullblown geniuses than by throwing

off the constraint of all rules they believe in effect

that one could make a braver show on the back of193

a wild horse than on the back of a trained animal

genius can only furnish rich material for products

of beautiful art its execution and its form require

talent cultivated in the schools in order to make

such a use of this material as will stand examination

by the judgement but it is quite ridiculous for a

man to speak and decide like a genius in things

which require the most careful investigation by

reason one does not know whether to laugh

more at the impostor who spreads such a mist round

him that we cannot clearly use our judgement and

so use our imagination the more or at the public

which navely imagines that his inability to cognise

clearly and to comprehend the masterpiece before

him arises from new truths crowding in on him in

such abundance that details duly weighed definitions

and accurate examination of fundamental propositions

seem but clumsy work
 48 of the relation of genius to taste
for judging of beautiful objects as such taste

is requisite but for beautiful art ie for the production

of such objects genius is requisite
if we consider genius as the talent for beautiful

art which the special meaning of the word implies

and in this point of view analyse it into the faculties

which must concur to constitute such a talent it is

necessary in the first instance to determine exactly

the difference between natural beauty the judging

of which requires only taste and artificial beauty

whose possibility to which reference must be made

in judging such an object requires genius
a natural beauty is a beautiful thing artificial

beauty is a beautiful representation of a thing
194

in order to judge of a natural beauty as such

i need not have beforehand a concept of what sort

of thing the object is to be ie i need not know

its material purposiveness the purpose but its

mere form pleases by itself in the act of judging it

without any knowledge of the purpose but if the

object is given as a product of art and as such is

to be declared beautiful then because art always

supposes a purpose in the cause and its causality

there must be at bottom in the first instance a

concept of what the thing is to be and as the

agreement of the manifold in a thing with its inner

destination its purpose constitutes the perfection

of the thing it follows that in judging of artificial

beauty the perfection of the thing must be taken

into account but in judging of natural beauty as

such there is no question at all about thisit is

true that in judging of objects of nature especially

objects endowed with life eg a man or a horse

their objective purposiveness also is commonly taken

into consideration in judging of their beauty but

then the judgement is no longer purely aesthetical

ie a mere judgement of taste nature is no longer

judged inasmuch as it appears like art but in so

far as it is actual although superhuman art and

the teleological judgement serves as the basis and

condition of the aesthetical as a condition to which

the latter must have respect in such a case eg

if it is said that is a beautiful woman we think

nothing else than this nature represents in her

figure the purposes in view in the shape of a womans

figure for we must look beyond the mere form to

a concept if the object is to be thought in such a

way by means of a logically conditioned aesthetical

judgement
195

beautiful art shows its superiority in this that

it describes as beautiful things which may be in

nature ugly or displeasing79 the furies diseases

the devastations of war etc may even regarded

as calamitous80 be described as very beautiful

and even represented in a picture there is only

one kind of ugliness which cannot be represented

in accordance with nature without destroying all

aesthetical satisfaction and consequently artificial

beauty viz that which excites disgust for in

this peculiar sensation which rests on mere imagination

the object is represented as it were obtruding

itself for our enjoyment while we strive against it

with all our might and the artistic representation

of the object is no longer distinguished from the

nature of the object itself in our sensation and thus

it is impossible that it can be regarded as beautiful

the art of sculpture again because in its products

art is almost interchangeable with nature excludes

from its creations the immediate representation of

ugly objects eg it represents death by a beautiful

genius the warlike spirit by mars and permits

all such things to be represented only by an

allegory or attribute81 that has a pleasing effect and

thus only indirectly by the aid of the interpretation of

reason and not for the mere aesthetical judgement
196

so much for the beautiful representation of an

object which is properly only the form of the presentation

of a concept and the means by which the

latter is communicated universallybut to give

this form to the product of beautiful art mere taste

is requisite by taste after he has exercised and

corrected it by manifold examples from art or nature

the artist checks his work and after many often

toilsome attempts to content taste he finds the

form which satisfies him hence this form is not

as it were a thing of inspiration or the result of a

free swing of the mental powers but of a slow and

even painful process of improvement by which he

seeks to render it adequate to his thought without

detriment to the freedom of the play of his powers
but taste is merely a judging and not a productive

faculty and what is appropriate to it is not therefore

a work of beautiful art it may be only a

product belonging to useful and mechanical art or

even to science produced according to definite rules

that can be learned and must be exactly followed

but the pleasing form that is given to it is only the

vehicle of communication and a mode as it were

of presenting it in respect of which we remain free

to a certain extent although it is combined with

a definite purpose thus we desire that table

appointments a moral treatise even a sermon

should have in themselves this form of beautiful

art without it seeming to be sought but we do not

therefore call these things works of beautiful art

under the latter class are reckoned a poem a piece

of music a picture gallery etc and in some wouldbe

works of beautiful art we find genius without

taste while in others we find taste without genius
197
 49 of the faculties of the mind that constitute

genius
we say of certain products of which we expect

that they should at least in part appear as beautiful

art they are without spirit82 although we find

nothing to blame in them on the score of taste a

poem may be very neat and elegant but without

spirit a history may be exact and well arranged

but without spirit a festal discourse may be solid

and at the same time elaborate but without spirit

conversation is often not devoid of entertainment

but yet without spirit even of a woman we say

that she is pretty an agreeable talker and courteous

but without spirit what then do we mean by

spirit
spirit in an aesthetical sense is the name given

to the animating principle of the mind but that

whereby this principle animates the soul the

material which it applies to that purpose is that

which puts the mental powers purposively into

swing ie into such a play as maintains itself and

strengthens the mental powers in their exercise
now i maintain that this principle is no other

than the faculty of presenting aesthetical ideas

and by an aesthetical idea i understand that representation

of the imagination which occasions much

thought without however any definite thought ie

any concept being capable of being adequate to

it it consequently cannot be completely compassed

and made intelligible by languagewe easily

see that it is the counterpart pendant of a rational198

idea which conversely is a concept to which no

intuition or representation of the imagination can

be adequate
the imagination as a productive faculty of

cognition is very powerful in creating another

nature as it were out of the material that actual

nature gives it we entertain ourselves with it

when experience proves too commonplace and by

it we remould experience always indeed in accordance

with analogical laws but yet also in accordance

with principles which occupy a higher place in

reason laws too which are just as natural to us as

those by which understanding comprehends empirical

nature thus we feel our freedom from the

law of association which attaches to the empirical

employment of imagination so that the material

which we borrow from nature in accordance with

this law can be worked up into something different

which surpasses nature
such representations of the imagination we may

call ideas partly because they at least strive after

something which lies beyond the bounds of experience

and so seek to approximate to a presentation

of concepts of reason intellectual ideas thus

giving to the latter the appearance of objective

realitybut especially because no concept can be

fully adequate to them as internal intuitions the

poet ventures to realise to sense rational ideas of

invisible beings the kingdom of the blessed hell

eternity creation etc or even if he deals with

things of which there are examples in experienceeg

death envy and all vices also love fame and

the likehe tries by means of imagination which

emulates the play of reason in its quest after a

maximum to go beyond the limits of experience199

and to present them to sense with a completeness

of which there is no example in nature it is

properly speaking in the art of the poet that the

faculty of aesthetical ideas can manifest itself in its

full measure but this faculty considered in itself

is properly only a talent of the imagination
if now we place under a concept a representation

of the imagination belonging to its presentation

but which occasions solely by itself more thought

than can ever be comprehended in a definite

concept and which therefore enlarges aesthetically

the concept itself in an unbounded fashionthe

imagination is here creative and it brings the

faculty of intellectual ideas the reason into movement

ie a movement occasioned by a representation

towards more thought though belonging no

doubt to the concept of the object than can be

grasped in the representation or made clear
those forms which do not constitute the presentation

of a given concept itself but only as

approximate representations of the imagination

express the consequences bound up with it and its

relationship to other concepts are called aesthetical

attributes of an object whose concept as a

rational idea cannot be adequately presented thus

jupiters eagle with the lightning in its claws is an

attribute of the mighty king of heaven as the

peacock is of its magnificent queen they do not

like logical attributes represent what lies in our

concepts of the sublimity and majesty of creation

but something different which gives occasion to

the imagination to spread itself over a number of

kindred representations that arouse more thought

than can be expressed in a concept determined by

words they furnish an aesthetical idea which200

for that rational idea takes the place of logical

presentation and thus as their proper office they

enliven the mind by opening out to it the prospect

into an illimitable field of kindred representations

but beautiful art does this not only in the case of

painting or sculpture in which the term attribute

is commonly employed poetry and rhetoric also

get the spirit that animates their works simply

from the aesthetical attributes of the object which

accompany the logical and stimulate the imagination

so that it thinks more by their aid although

in an undeveloped way than could be comprehended

in a concept and therefore in a definite form of

words for the sake of brevity i must limit

myself to a few examples only
when the great king83 in one of his poems

expresses himself as follows


oui finissons sans trouble et mourons sans regrets
en laissant lunivers combl de nos bienfaits
ainsi lastre du jour au bout de sa carrire
rpand sur lhorizon une douce lumire
et les derniers rayons quil darde dans les airs
sont les derniers soupirs quil donne  lunivers


he quickens his rational idea of a cosmopolitan

disposition at the end of life by an attribute which

the imagination in remembering all the pleasures

of a beautiful summer day that are recalled at its

close by a serene evening associates with that

representation and which excites a number of

sensations and secondary representations for which

no expression is found on the other hand an

intellectual concept may serve conversely as an201

attribute for a representation of sense and so can

quicken this latter by means of the idea of the

supersensible but only by the aesthetical element

that subjectively attaches to the concept of the

latter being here employed thus for example a

certain poet84 says in his description of a beautiful

morning


the sun arose
as calm from virtue springs


the consciousness of virtue even if one only places

oneself in thought in the position of a virtuous man

diffuses in the mind a multitude of sublime and

restful feelings and a boundless prospect of a joyful

future to which no expression measured by a definite

concept completely attains85
in a word the aesthetical idea is a representation

of the imagination associated with a given concept

which is bound up with such a multiplicity of partial

representations in its free employment that for it no

expression marking a definite concept can be found

and such a representation therefore adds to a

concept much ineffable thought the feeling of which

quickens the cognitive faculties and with language

which is the mere letter binds up spirit also
the mental powers therefore whose union in a202

certain relation constitutes genius are imagination

and understanding in the employment of the

imagination for cognition it submits to the constraint

of the understanding and is subject to the limitation

of being conformable to the concept of the latter

on the other hand in an aesthetical point of view it

is free to furnish unsought over and above that

agreement with a concept abundance of undeveloped

material for the understanding to which the

understanding paid no regard in its concept but

which it applies though not objectively for cognition

yet subjectively to quicken the cognitive

powers and therefore also indirectly to cognitions

thus genius properly consists in the happy relation

between these faculties which no science can teach

and no industry can learn by which ideas are found

for a given concept and on the other hand we thus

find for these ideas the expression by means of

which the subjective state of mind brought about by

them as an accompaniment of the concept can be

communicated to others the latter talent is properly

speaking what is called spirit for to express

the ineffable element in the state of mind implied by

a certain representation and to make it universally

communicablewhether the expression be in speech

or painting or statuarythis requires a faculty of

seizing the quickly passing play of imagination and

of unifying it in a concept which is even on that

account original and discloses a new rule that could

not have been inferred from any preceding principles

or examples that can be communicated without any

constraint of rules86
    
if after this analysis we look back to the explanation203

given above of what is called genius we find

first that it is a talent for art not for science in

which clearly known rules must go beforehand and

determine the procedure secondly as an artistic

talent it presupposes a definite concept of the product

as the purpose and therefore understanding

but it also presupposes a representation although

an indeterminate one of the material ie of the

intuition for the presentment of this concept and

therefore a relation between the imagination and

the understanding thirdly it shows itself not so

much in the accomplishment of the proposed purpose

in a presentment of a definite concept as in the

enunciation or expression of aesthetical ideas which

contain abundant material for that very design and

consequently it represents the imagination as free

from all guidance of rules and yet as purposive in

reference to the presentment of the given concept

finally in the fourth place the unsought undesigned

subjective purposiveness in the free accordance of

the imagination with the legality of the understanding

presupposes such a proportion and disposition

of these faculties as no following of rules whether

of science or of mechanical imitation can bring

about but which only the nature of the subject can

produce
in accordance with these suppositions genius is

the exemplary originality of the natural gifts of a

subject in the free employment of his cognitive

faculties in this way the product of a genius as

regards what is to be ascribed to genius and not to

possible learning or schooling is an example not

to be imitated for then that which in it is genius

and constitutes the spirit of the work would be lost

but to be followed by another genius whom it204

awakens to a feeling of his own originality and

whom it stirs so to exercise his art in freedom from

the constraint of rules that thereby a new rule is

gained for art and thus his talent shows itself to be

exemplary but because a genius is a favourite of

nature and must be regarded by us as a rare phenomenon

his example produces for other good heads

a school ie a methodical system of teaching according

to rules so far as these can be derived from the

peculiarities of the products of his spirit for such

persons beautiful art is so far imitation to which

nature through the medium of a genius supplied

the rule
but this imitation becomes a mere aping if the

scholar copies everything down to the deformities

which the genius must have let pass only because

he could not well remove them without weakening

his idea this mental characteristic is meritorious

only in the case of a genius a certain audacity in

expressionand in general many a departure from

common rulesbecomes him well but it is in no

way worthy of imitation it always remains a fault

in itself which we must seek to remove though the

genius is as it were privileged to commit it because

the inimitable rush of his spirit would suffer from

overanxious carefulness mannerism is another

kind of aping viz of mere peculiarity originality in

general by which a man separates himself as far as

possible from imitators without however possessing

the talent to be at the same time exemplarythere

are indeed in general two ways modi in

which such a man may put together his notions of

expressing himself the one is called a manner modus

aestheticus the other a method modus logicus they

differ in this that the former has no other standard205

than the feeling of unity in the presentment but the

latter follows definite principles hence the former

alone avails for beautiful art but an artistic product

is said to show mannerism only when the

exposition of the artists idea is founded on its very

singularity and is not made appropriate to the idea

itself the ostentatious prcieux contorted and

affected manner adopted to differentiate oneself

from ordinary persons though devoid of spirit is

like the behaviour of a man of whom we say that

he hears himself talk or who stands and moves

about as if he were on a stage in order to be stared

at this always betrays a bungler
 50 of the combination of taste with genius in

the products of beautiful art
to ask whether it is more important for the

things of beautiful art that genius or taste should

be displayed is the same as to ask whether in it

more depends on imagination or on judgement

now since in respect of the first an art is rather

said to be full of spirit but only deserves to be

called a beautiful art on account of the second

this latter is at least as its indispensable condition

conditio sine qua non the most important thing

to which one has to look in the judging of art as

beautiful art abundance and originality of ideas

are less necessary to beauty than the accordance

of the imagination in its freedom with the conformity

to law of the understanding for all the abundance

of the former produces in lawless freedom nothing

but nonsense on the other hand the judgement

is the faculty by which it is adjusted to the

understanding
206

taste like the judgement in general is the

discipline or training of genius it clips its wings

closely and makes it cultured and polished but at

the same time it gives guidance as to where and

how far it may extend itself if it is to remain

purposive and while it brings clearness and order

into the multitude of the thoughts it makes the

ideas susceptible of being permanently and at the

same time universally assented to and capable of

being followed by others and of an everprogressive

culture if then in the conflict of these two properties

in a product something must be sacrificed it should

be rather on the side of genius and the judgement

which in the things of beautiful art gives its decision

from its own proper principles will rather sacrifice

the freedom and wealth of the imagination than

permit anything prejudicial to the understanding
for beautiful art therefore imagination understanding

spirit and taste are requisite87
 51 of the division of the beautiful arts
we may describe beauty in general whether

natural or artificial as the expression of aesthetical

ideas only that in beautiful art this idea must

be occasioned by a concept of the object whilst

in beautiful nature the mere reflection upon a

given intuition without any concept of what the

object is to be is sufficient for the awakening and207

communicating of the idea of which that object

is regarded as the expression
if then we wish to make a division of the

beautiful arts we cannot choose a more convenient

principle at least tentatively than the analogy of

art with the mode of expression of which men

avail themselves in speech in order to communicate

to one another as perfectly as possible not merely

their concepts but also their sensations88this

is done by word deportment and tone articulation

gesticulation and modulation it is only by the

combination of these three kinds of expression that

communication between the speaker and his hearers

can be complete for thus thought intuition and

sensation are transmitted to others simultaneously

and conjointly
there are therefore only three kinds of beautiful

arts the arts of speech the formative arts and the

art of the play of sensations as external sensible

impressions we may also arrange a division by

dichotomy thus beautiful art may be divided

into the art of expression of thoughts and of intuitions

and these further subdivided in accordance

with their form or their matter sensation but

this would appear to be too abstract and not so

accordant with ordinary concepts
1 the arts of speech are rhetoric and poetry

rhetoric is the art of carrying on a serious business

of the understanding as if it were a free play of

the imagination poetry the art of conducting a

free play of the imagination as if it were a serious

business of the understanding
208

the orator then promises a serious business

and in order to entertain his audience conducts it

as if it were a mere play with ideas the poet

merely promises an entertaining play with ideas

and yet it has the same effect upon the understanding

as if he had only intended to carry on

its business the combination and harmony of

both cognitive faculties sensibility and understanding

which cannot dispense with one another

but which yet cannot well be united without constraint

and mutual prejudice must appear to be undesigned

and so to be brought about by themselves

otherwise it is not beautiful art hence all that

is studied and anxious must be avoided in it for

beautiful art must be free art in a double sense

it is not a work like that of a tradesman the

magnitude of which can be judged exacted or

paid for according to a definite standard and again

though the mind is occupied still it feels itself

contented and stimulated without looking to any

other purpose independently of reward
the orator therefore gives something which he

does not promise viz an entertaining play of the

imagination but he also fails to supply what he

did promise which is indeed his announced business

viz the purposive occupation of the understanding

on the other hand the poet promises

little and announces a mere play with ideas but

he supplies something which is worth occupying

ourselves with because he provides in this play

food for the understanding and by the aid of

imagination gives life to his concepts thus the

orator on the whole gives less the poet more than

he promises89
209

2 the formative arts or those by which expression

is found for ideas in sensible intuition not

by representations of mere imagination that are

aroused by words are either arts of sensible truth or

of sensible illusion the former is called plastic the

latter painting both express ideas by figures in

space the former makes figures cognisable by two

senses sight and touch although not by the latter

as far as beauty is concerned the latter only by

one the first of these the aesthetical idea the

archetype or original image is fundamental for both

in the imagination but the figure which expresses

this the ectype or copy is either given in its

bodily extension as the object itself exists or as it

paints itself on the eye according to its appearance

when projected on a flat surface in the first case90

the condition given to reflection may be either the

reference to an actual purpose or only the semblance

of it
to plastic the first kind of beautiful formative

art belong sculpture and architecture the first

presents corporeally concepts of things as they

might have existed in nature though as beautiful art

it has regard to aesthetical purposiveness the

second is the art of presenting concepts of things

that are possible only through art and whose form

has for its determining ground not nature but an

arbitrary purpose with the view of presenting them

with aesthetical purposiveness in the latter the

chief point is a certain use of the artistic object by

which condition the aesthetical ideas are limited

in the former the main design is the mere expression

of aesthetical ideas thus statues of men gods210

animals etc are of the first kind but temples

splendid buildings for public assemblies even

dwellinghouses triumphal arches columns mausoleums

and the like erected in honourable remembrance

belong to architecture indeed all house

furniture upholsterers work and such like things

which are for use may be reckoned under this art

because the suitability of a product for a certain use is

the essential thing in an architectural work on the

other hand a mere piece of sculpture which is simply

made for show and which is to please in itself is as

a corporeal presentation a mere imitation of nature

though with a reference to aesthetical ideas in it

sensible truth is not to be carried so far that the

product ceases to look like art and looks like a product

of the elective will
painting as the second kind of formative art

which presents a sensible illusion artificially combined

with ideas i would divide into the art of the

beautiful depicting of nature and that of the beautiful

arrangement of its products the first is painting

proper the second is the art of landscape gardening

the first gives only the illusory appearance of

corporeal extension the second gives this in

accordance with truth but only the appearance of

utility and availableness for other purposes than the

mere play of the imagination in the contemplation

of its forms91 this latter is nothing else than the211

ornamentation of the soil with a variety of those

things grasses flowers shrubs trees even ponds

hillocks and dells which nature presents to an

observer only arranged differently and in conformity

with certain ideas but again the beautiful arrangement

of corporeal things is only apparent to the eye

like painting the sense of touch cannot supply any

intuitive presentation of such a form under painting

in the wide sense i would reckon the decoration

of rooms by the aid of tapestry bricabrac and all

beautiful furniture which is merely available to be

looked at and the same may be said of the art of

tasteful dressing with rings snuffboxes etc for

a bed of various flowers a room filled with various

ornaments including under this head even ladies

finery make at a fte a kind of picture which like

pictures properly socalled that are not intended to

teach either history or natural science has in view

merely the entertainment of the imagination in free

play with ideas and the occupation of the aesthetical

judgement without any definite purpose the

detailed work in all this decoration may be quite

distinct in the different cases and may require

very different artists but the judgement of taste

upon whatever is beautiful in these various arts is

always determined in the same way viz it only

judges the forms without any reference to a

purpose as they present themselves to the eye

either singly or in combination according to the

effect they produce upon the imaginationbut

that formative art may be compared by analogy212

with deportment in speech is justified by the fact

that the spirit of the artist supplies by these figures

a bodily expression to his thought and its mode and

makes the thing itself as it were speak in mimic

language this is a very common play of our

fancy which attributes to lifeless things a spirit

suitable to their form by which they speak to us
3 the art of the beautiful play of sensations

externally stimulated which admits at the

same time of universal communication can be concerned

with nothing else than the proportion of the

different degrees of the disposition tension of the

sense to which the sensation belongs ie with its tone

in this farreaching signification of the word it may

be divided into the artistic play of the sensations of

hearing and sight ie into music and the art of

colourit is noteworthy that these two senses

besides their susceptibility for impressions so far as

these are needed to gain concepts of external objects

are also capable of a peculiar sensation bound up

therewith of which we cannot strictly decide whether

it is based on sense or reflection this susceptibility

may sometimes be wanting although in other respects

the sense as regards its use for the cognition of

objects is not at all deficient but is peculiarly fine

that is we cannot say with certainty whether

colours or tones sounds are merely pleasant sensations

or whether they form in themselves a beautiful

play of sensations and as such bring with them

in aesthetical judgement a satisfaction in their form

if we think of the velocity of the vibrations of light

or in the second case of the air which probably far

surpasses all our faculty of judging immediately in

perception the time interval between them we must

believe that it is only the effect of these vibrations213

upon the elastic parts of our body that is felt but

that the time interval between them is not remarked

or brought into judgement and thus that only

pleasantness and not beauty of composition is bound

up with colours and tones but on the other hand

first we think of the mathematical element which

enables us to pronounce on the proportion between

these oscillations in music and thus to judge of

them and by analogy with which we easily may

judge of the distinctions between colours secondly

we recall instances although they are rare of men

who with the best sight in the world cannot distinguish

colours and with the sharpest hearing

cannot distinguish tones whilst for those who can

do this the perception of an altered quality not

merely of the degree of sensation in the different

intensities in the scale of colours and tones is

definite and further the very number of these is

fixed by intelligible differences thus we may be

compelled to see that both kinds of sensations are

to be regarded not as mere sensible impressions

but as the effects of a judgement passed upon the

form in the play of divers sensations the difference

in our definition according as we adopt the

one or the other opinion in judging of the grounds

of music would be just this either as we have

done we must explain it as the beautiful play of

sensations of hearing or else as a play of pleasant

sensations according to the former mode of

explanation music is represented altogether as a

beautiful art according to the latter as a pleasant

art at least in part
214
 52 of the combination of beautiful arts in one

and the same product
rhetoric may be combined with a pictorial presentation

of its subjects and objects in a theatrical

piece poetry may be combined with music in a

song and this again with pictorial theatrical presentation

in an opera the play of sensations in

music may be combined with the play of figures in

the dance and so on even the presentation of the

sublime so far as it belongs to beautiful art may

combine with beauty in a tragedy in verse in a

didactic poem in an oratorio and in these combinations

beautiful art is yet more artistic whether it

is also more beautiful may in some of these cases be

doubted since so many different kinds of satisfaction

cross one another yet in all beautiful art the

essential thing is the form which is purposive as

regards our observation and judgement where the

pleasure is at the same time cultivation and disposes

the spirit to ideas and consequently makes it susceptible

of still more of such pleasure and entertainment

the essential element is not the matter

of sensation charm or emotion which has only to

do with enjoyment this leaves behind nothing in

the idea and it makes the spirit dull the object

gradually distasteful and the mind on account of

its consciousness of a disposition that conflicts with

purpose in the judgement of reason discontented

with itself and peevish
if the beautiful arts are not brought into more or

less close combination with moral ideas which alone

bring with them a selfsufficing satisfaction this latter

fate must ultimately be theirs they then serve only

as a distraction of which we are the more in need the215

more we avail ourselves of them to disperse the discontent

of the mind with itself so that we thus render

ourselves ever more useless and ever more discontented

the beauties of nature are generally of most

benefit in this point of view if we are early accustomed

to observe appreciate and admire them
 53 comparison of the respective aesthetical worth

of the beautiful arts
of all the arts poetry which owes its origin

almost entirely to genius and will least be guided by

precept or example maintains the first rank it

expands the mind by setting the imagination at

liberty and by offering within the limits of a given

concept amid the unbounded variety of possible

forms accordant therewith that which unites the

presentment of this concept with a wealth of thought

to which no verbal expression is completely

adequate and so rising aesthetically to ideas it

strengthens the mind by making it feel its facultyfree

spontaneous and independent of natural determinationof

considering and judging nature as a

phenomenon in accordance with aspects which it

does not present in experience either for sense or

understanding and therefore of using it on behalf

of and as a sort of schema for the supersensible

it plays with illusion which it produces at pleasure

but without deceiving by it for it declares its

exercise to be mere play which however can be purposively

used by the understandingrhetoric

in so far as this means the art of persuasion ie

of deceiving by a beautiful show ars oratoria

and not mere elegance of speech eloquence and

style is a dialectic which borrows from poetry216

only so much as is needful to win minds to the side

of the orator before they have formed a judgement

and to deprive them of their freedom it cannot

therefore be recommended either for the law courts

or for the pulpit for if we are dealing with civil

law with the rights of individual persons or with

lasting instruction and determination of peoples

minds to an accurate knowledge and a conscientious

observance of their duty it is unworthy of so

important a business to allow a trace of any exuberance

of wit and imagination to appear and still

less any trace of the art of talking people over and

of captivating them for the advantage of any chance

person for although this art may sometimes be

directed to legitimate and praiseworthy designs it

becomes objectionable when in this way maxims and

dispositions are spoiled in a subjective point of view

though the action may objectively be lawful it is

not enough to do what is right we should practise

it solely on the ground that it is right again the

mere concept of this species of matters of human

concern when clear and combined with a lively

presentation of it in examples without any offence

against the rules of euphony of speech or propriety

of expression has by itself for ideas of reason which

collectively constitute eloquence sufficient influence

upon human minds so that it is not needful to add

the machinery of persuasion which since it can be

used equally well to beautify or to hide vice and

error cannot quite lull the secret suspicion that one

is being artfully overreached in poetry everything

proceeds with honesty and candour it

declares itself to be a mere entertaining play of the

imagination which wishes to proceed as regards

form in harmony with the laws of the understanding217

and it does not desire to steal upon and

ensnare the understanding by the aid of sensible

presentation92
after poetry if we are to deal with charm and

mental movement i would place that art which comes

nearest to the art of speech and can very naturally

be united with it viz the art of tone for although

it speaks by means of mere sensations without concepts

and so does not like poetry leave anything

over for reflection it yet moves the mind in a greater

variety of ways and more intensely although only

transitorily it is however rather enjoyment than

culture the play of thought that is incidentally

excited by its means is merely the effect of a kind of

mechanical association and in the judgement of

reason it has less worth than any other of the beautiful

arts hence like all enjoyment it desires constant

change and does not bear frequent repetition without

producing weariness its charm which admits

of universal communication appears to rest on this218

that every expression of speech has in its context a

tone appropriate to the sense this tone indicates

more or less an affection of the speaker and produces

it also in the hearer which affection excites

in its turn in the hearer the idea that is expressed

in speech by the tone in question thus as modulation

is as it were a universal language of sensations

intelligible to every man the art of tone employs

it by itself alone in its full force viz as a language

of the affections and thus communicates universally

according to the laws of association the aesthetical

ideas naturally combined therewith now these

aesthetical ideas are not concepts or determinate

thoughts hence the form of the composition of

these sensations harmony and melody only serves

instead of the form of language by means of their

proportionate accordance to express the aesthetical

idea of a connected whole of an unspeakable wealth

of thought corresponding to a certain theme which

produces the dominating affection in the piece this

can be brought mathematically under certain rules

because it rests in the case of tones on the relation

between the number of vibrations of the air in the

same time so far as these tones are combined simultaneously

or successively to this mathematical

form although not represented by determinate concepts

alone attaches the satisfaction that unites the

mere reflection upon such a number of concomitant

or consecutive sensations with this their play as a

condition of its beauty valid for every man it is

this alone which permits taste to claim in advance

a rightful authority over every ones judgement
but in the charm and mental movement produced

by music mathematic has certainly not the slightest

share it is only the indispensable condition conditio219

sine qua non of that proportion of the impressions

in their combination and in their alternation by

which it becomes possible to gather them together

and prevent them from destroying one another and

to harmonise them so as to produce a continual

movement and animation of the mind by means of

affections consonant therewith and thus a delightful

personal enjoyment
if on the other hand we estimate the worth of

the beautiful arts by the culture they supply to the

mind and take as a standard the expansion of the

faculties which must concur in the judgement for

cognition music will have the lowest place among

them as it has perhaps the highest among those arts

which are valued for their pleasantness because it

merely plays with sensations the formative arts

are far before it in this point of view for in putting

the imagination in a free play which is also

accordant with the understanding they at the same

time carry on a serious business this they do by

producing a product that serves for concepts as a

permanent selfcommendatory vehicle for promoting

their union with sensibility and thus as it were

the urbanity of the higher cognitive powers these

two species of art take quite different courses the

first proceeds from sensations to indeterminate ideas

the second from determinate ideas to sensations

the latter produce permanent the former only

transitory impressions the imagination can recall

the one and entertain itself pleasantly therewith

but the other either vanish entirely or if they are

recalled involuntarily by the imagination they are

rather wearisome than pleasant93 besides there220

attaches to music a certain want of urbanity from

the fact that chiefly from the character of its instruments

it extends its influence further than is desired

in the neighbourhood and so as it were obtrudes

itself and does violence to the freedom of others

who are not of the musical company the arts

which appeal to the eyes do not do this for we need

only turn our eyes away if we wish to avoid being

impressed the case of music is almost like that of

the delight derived from a smell that diffuses itself

widely the man who pulls his perfumed handkerchief

out of his pocket attracts the attention of all

round him even against their will and he forces

them if they are to breathe at all to enjoy the

scent hence this habit has gone out of fashion94
among the formative arts i would give the palm

to painting partly because as the art of delineation

it lies at the root of all the other formative arts and

partly because it can penetrate much further into

the region of ideas and can extend the field of

intuition in conformity with them further than the

others can
 54 remark
as we have often shown there is an essential

difference between what satisfies simply in the act221

of judging it and that which gratifies pleases in

sensation we cannot ascribe the latter to every

one as we can the former gratification the causes

of which may even be situate in ideas appears

always to consist in a feeling of the furtherance of

the whole life of the man and consequently also

of his bodily wellbeing ie his health so that

epicurus who gave out that all gratification was at

bottom bodily sensation may perhaps not have

been wrong but only misunderstood himself when

he reckoned intellectual and even practical satisfaction

under gratification if we have this distinction

in view we can explain how a gratification may

dissatisfy the man who sensibly feels it eg the

joy of a needy but wellmeaning man at becoming

the heir of an affectionate but penurious father

or how a deep grief may satisfy the person experiencing

it the sorrow of a widow at the death of her

excellent husband or how a gratification can in

addition satisfy as in the sciences that we pursue

or how a grief eg hatred envy revenge can

moreover dissatisfy the satisfaction or dissatisfaction

here depends on reason and is the same as

approbation or disapprobation but gratification and

grief can only rest on the feeling or prospect of

a possible on whatever grounds wellbeing or its

opposite
all changing free play of sensations that have no

design at their basis gratifies because it promotes

the feeling of health in the judgement of reason

we may or may not have any satisfaction in its

object or even in this gratification and this latter

may rise to the height of an affection although we

take no interest in the object at least none that is

proportionate to the degree of the affection we222

may subdivide this free play of sensations into the

play of fortune games of chance the play of tone

music and the play of thought wit the first

requires an interest whether of vanity or of selfishness

which however is not nearly so great as the

interest that attaches to the way in which we are

striving to procure it the second requires merely

the change of sensations all of which have a relation

to affection though they have not the degree of

affection and excite aesthetical ideas the third

springs merely from the change of representations

in the judgement by it indeed no thought that

brings an interest with it is produced but yet the

mind is animated thereby
how much gratification games must afford

without any necessity of placing at their basis an

interested design all our evening parties show

for hardly any of them can be carried on without a

game but the affections of hope fear joy wrath

scorn are put in play by them alternating every

moment and they are so vivid that by them as

by a kind of internal motion all the vital processes

of the body seem to be promoted as is shown by

the mental vivacity excited by them although

nothing is gained or learnt thereby but as the

beautiful does not enter into games of chance we

will here set them aside on the other hand music

and that which excites laughter are two different

kinds of play with aesthetical ideas or with representations

of the understanding through which

ultimately nothing is thought and yet they can

give lively gratification merely by their changes

thus we recognise pretty clearly that the animation

in both cases is merely bodily although it is excited

by ideas of the mind and that the feeling of223

health produced by a motion of the intestines

corresponding to the play in question makes up

that whole gratification of a gay party which is

regarded as so refined and so spiritual it is not

the judging the harmony in tones or sallies of witwhich

serves only in combination with their

beauty as a necessary vehiclebut the furtherance

of the vital bodily processes the affection that

moves the intestines and the diaphragm in a word

the feeling of health which without such inducements

one does not feel that makes up the gratification

felt by us so that we can thus reach the body

through the soul and use the latter as the physician

of the former
in music this play proceeds from bodily sensations

to aesthetical ideas the objects of our

affections and then from these back again to the

body with redoubled force in the case of jokes

the art of which just like music should rather be

reckoned as pleasant than beautiful the play begins

with the thoughts which together occupy the body

so far as they admit of sensible expression and

as the understanding stops suddenly short at this

presentment in which it does not find what it expected

we feel the effect of this slackening in the

body by the oscillation of the organs which promotes

the restoration of equilibrium and has a favourable

influence upon health
in everything that is to excite a lively convulsive

laugh there must be something absurd in which the

understanding therefore can find no satisfaction

laughter is an affection arising from the sudden

transformation of a strained expectation into nothing95

this transformation which is certainly not enjoyable224

by the understanding yet indirectly gives it very

active enjoyment for a moment therefore its

cause must consist in the influence of the representation

upon the body and the reflex effect of

this upon the mind not indeed through the

representation being objectively an object of gratification96

for how could a delusive expectation

gratify but simply through it as a mere play of

representations bringing about an equilibrium of

the vital powers in the body
suppose this story to be told an indian at the

table of an englishman in surat when he saw a

bottle of ale opened and all the beer turned into

froth and overflowing testified his great astonishment

with many exclamations when the englishman

asked him what is there in this to astonish you so

much he answered i am not at all astonished

that it should flow out but i do wonder how you

ever got it in at this story we laugh and it gives

us hearty pleasure not because we deem ourselves

cleverer than this ignorant man or because of anything

else in it that we note as satisfactory to the

understanding but because our expectation was

strained for a time and then was suddenly

dissipated into nothing again the heir of a

rich relative wished to arrange for an imposing

funeral but he lamented that he could not properly

succeed for said he the more money i give

my mourners to look sad the more cheerful they

look97 when we hear this story we laugh loud

and the reason is that an expectation is suddenly225

transformed into nothing we must note well that

it does not transform itself into the positive opposite

of an expected objectfor then there would still be

something which might even be a cause of griefbut

it must be transformed into nothing for if a

man arouses great expectations in us when telling a

story and at the end we see its falsehood immediately

it displeases us eg the story of the people

whose hair in consequence of great grief turned

gray in one night but if a wag to repair the effect

of this story describes very circumstantially the

grief of the merchant returning from india to

europe with all his wealth in merchandise who was

forced to throw it overboard in a heavy storm

and who grieved thereat so much that his wig

turned gray the same nightwe laugh and it gives

us gratification for we treat our own mistake in

the case of an object otherwise indifferent to us or

rather the idea which we are following out as we

treat a ball which we knock to and fro for a time

though our only serious intention is to seize it and

hold it fast it is not the mere rebuff of a liar or

a simpleton that arouses our gratification for the

latter story told with assumed seriousness would set

a whole company in a roar of laughter while the

former would ordinarily not be regarded as worth

attending to
it is remarkable that in all such cases the jest

must contain something that is capable of deceiving

for a moment hence when the illusion is dissipated

the mind turns back to try it once again and

thus through a rapidly alternating tension and relaxation

it is jerked back and put into a state of

oscillation this because the strain on the cord as

it were is suddenly and not gradually relaxed must226

occasion a mental movement and an inner bodily

movement harmonising therewith which continues

involuntarily and fatigues even while cheering us

the effects of a motion conducive to health
for if we admit that with all our thoughts is

harmonically combined a movement in the organs

of the body we shall easily comprehend how to this

sudden transposition of the mind now to one now

to another standpoint in order to contemplate its

object may correspond an alternating tension and

relaxation of the elastic portions of our intestines

which communicates itself to the diaphragm like

that which ticklish people feel in connexion with

this the lungs expel the air at rapidly succeeding

intervals and thus bring about a movement

beneficial to health which alone and not what

precedes it in the mind is the proper cause of the

gratification in a thought that at bottom represents

nothingvoltaire said that heaven had given us

two things to counterbalance the many miseries of

life hope and sleep98 he could have added laughter

if the means of exciting it in reasonable men were

only as easily attainable and the requisite wit or

originality of humour were not so rare as the talent

is common of imagining things which break ones

head as mystic dreamers do or which break ones

neck as your genius does or which break ones heart

as sentimental romancewriters and even moralists

of the same kidney do
we may therefore as it seems to me readily227

concede to epicurus that all gratification even that

which is occasioned through concepts excited by

aesthetical ideas is animal ie bodily sensation

without the least prejudice to the spiritual feeling

of respect for moral ideas which is not gratification

at all but an esteem for self for humanity in us

that raises us above the need of gratification and

even without the slightest prejudice to the less

noble feeling of taste
we find a combination of these two last in

naivet which is the breaking out of the sincerity

originally natural to humanity in opposition to that

art of dissimulation which has become a second

nature we laugh at the simplicity that does not

understand how to dissemble and yet we are

delighted with the simplicity of the nature which

thwarts that art we look for the commonplace

manner of artificial utterance devised with foresight

to make a fair show and behold it is the

unspoiled innocent nature which we do not expect

to find and which he who displays it did not think

of disclosing that the fair but false show which

generally has so much influence upon our judgement

is here suddenly transformed into nothing so that

as it were the rogue in us is laid bare produces a

movement of the mind in two opposite directions

which gives a wholesome shock to the body but

the fact that something infinitely better than all

assumed manner viz purity of disposition or at

least the tendency thereto is not quite extinguished

yet in human nature blends seriousness and high

esteem with this play of the judgement but because

it is only a transitory phenomenon and the

veil of dissimulation is soon drawn over it again

there is mingled therewith a compassion which is228

an emotion of tenderness this as play readily

admits of combination with a goodhearted laugh

and ordinarily is actually so combined and withal is

wont to compensate him who supplies its material

for the embarrassment which results from not yet

being wise after the manner of menan art that

is to be naive is thus a contradiction but the

representation of naivet in a fictitious personage

is quite possible and is a beautiful though a

rare art naivet must not be confounded with

openhearted simplicity which does not artificially

spoil nature solely because it does not understand

the art of social intercourse
the humorous manner again may be classified

as that which as exhilarating us is near akin to

the gratification that proceeds from laughter and

belongs to the originality of spirit but not to

the talent of beautiful art humour in the good

sense means the talent of being able voluntarily

to put oneself into a certain mental disposition

in which everything is judged quite differently

from the ordinary method reversed in fact and

yet in accordance with certain rational principles

in such a frame of mind he who is involuntarily

subject to such mutations is called a man of humours

launisch but he who can assume them voluntarily

and purposively on behalf of a lively presentment

brought about by the aid of a contrast that excites

a laughhe and his manner of speech are called

humorous launigt this manner however belongs

rather to pleasant than to beautiful art because the

object of the latter must always exhibit intrinsic

worth and hence requires a certain seriousness in

the presentation as taste does in the act of

judgement

229

second division
dialectic of the aesthetical judgement
 55
a faculty of judgement that is to be dialectical

must in the first place be rationalising ie its judgements

must claim universality99 and that a priori

for it is in the opposition of such judgements that

dialectic consists hence the incompatibility of

aesthetical judgements of sense about the pleasant

and the unpleasant is not dialectical and again

the conflict between judgements of taste so far

as each man depends merely on his own taste

forms no dialectic of taste because no one proposes

to make his own judgement a universal rule there

remains therefore no other concept of a dialectic

which has to do with taste than that of a dialectic

of the critique of taste not of taste itself in respect

of its principles for here concepts that contradict

one another as to the ground of the possibility of

judgements of taste in general naturally and unavoidably

present themselves the transcendental230

critique of taste will therefore contain a part which

can bear the name of a dialectic of the aesthetical

judgement only if and so far as there is found an

antinomy of the principles of this faculty which

renders its conformity to law and consequently also

its internal possibility doubtful
 56 representation of the antinomy of taste
the first commonplace of taste is contained in

the proposition with which every tasteless person

proposes to avoid blame every one has his own taste

that is as much as to say that the determining

ground of this judgement is merely subjective gratification

or grief and that the judgement has no

right to the necessary assent of others
the second commonplace invoked even by those

who admit for judgements of taste the right to speak

with validity for every one is there is no disputing

about taste that is as much as to say that the determining

ground of a judgement of taste may indeed be

objective but that it cannot be reduced to definite

concepts and that consequently about the judgement

itself nothing can be decided by proofs although

much may rightly be contested for contesting quarrelling

and disputing controversy are doubtless the

same in this that by means of the mutual opposition

of judgements they seek to produce their accordance

but different in that the latter hopes to bring this

about according to definite concepts as determining

grounds and consequently assumes objective concepts

as grounds of the judgement but where this is

regarded as impracticable controversy is regarded

as alike impracticable
we easily see that between these two commonplaces231

there is a proposition wanting which though

it has not passed into a proverb is yet familiar

to every one viz there may be a quarrel about

taste although there can be no controversy but

this proposition involves the contradictory of the

former one for wherever quarrelling is permissible

there must be a hope of mutual reconciliation

and consequently we can count on grounds of our

judgement that have not merely private validity and

therefore are not merely subjective and to this

the proposition every one has his own taste is

directly opposed
there emerges therefore in respect of the principle

of taste the following antinomy
1 thesis the judgement of taste is not

based upon concepts for otherwise it would

admit of controversy would be determinable by

proofs
2 antithesis the judgement of taste is based

on concepts for otherwise despite its diversity we

could not quarrel about it we could not claim for

our judgement the necessary assent of others
 57 solution of the antinomy of taste
there is no possibility of removing the conflict

between these principles that underlie every judgement

of taste which are nothing else than the two

peculiarities of the judgement of taste exhibited

above in the analytic except by showing that the

concept to which we refer the object in this kind

of judgement is not taken in the same sense in both

maxims of the aesthetical judgement this twofold

sense or twofold point of view is necessary to our

transcendental judgement but also the illusion232

which arises from the confusion of one with the

other is natural and unavoidable
the judgement of taste must refer to some concept

otherwise it could make absolutely no claim

to be necessarily valid for every one but it is not

therefore capable of being proved from a concept

because a concept may be either determinable or in

itself undetermined and undeterminable the concepts

of the understanding are of the former kind

they are determinable through predicates of sensible

intuition which can correspond to them but the

transcendental rational concept of the supersensible

which lies at the basis of all sensible intuition is of

the latter kind and therefore cannot be theoretically

determined further
now the judgement of taste is applied to objects

of sense but not with a view of determining a concept

of them for the understanding for it is not a

cognitive judgement it is thus only a private

judgement in which a singular representation intuitively

perceived is referred to the feeling of pleasure

and so far would be limited as regards its validity

to the individual judging the object is for me an

object of satisfaction by others it may be regarded

quite differentlyevery one has his own taste
nevertheless there is undoubtedly contained in

the judgement of taste a wider reference of the

representation of the object as well as of the

subject whereon we base an extension of judgements

of this kind as necessary for every one at

the basis of this there must necessarily be a concept

somewhere though a concept which cannot be

determined through intuition but through a concept

of this sort we know nothing and consequently

it can supply no proof for the judgement of taste233

such a concept is the mere pure rational concept of

the supersensible which underlies the object and

also the subject judging it regarded as an object

of sense and thus as phenomenon100 for if we do

not admit such a reference the claim of the judgement

of taste to universal validity would not hold

good if the concept on which it is based were

only a mere confused concept of the understanding

like that of perfection with which we could bring

the sensible intuition of the beautiful into correspondence

it would be at least possible in itself to

base the judgement of taste on proofs which contradicts

the thesis
but all contradiction disappears if i say the

judgement of taste is based on a concept viz the

concept of the general ground of the subjective

purposiveness of nature for the judgement from

which however nothing can be known and proved

in respect of the object because it is in itself

undeterminable and useless for knowledge yet at

the same time and on that very account the judgement

has validity for every one though of course

for each only as a singular judgement immediately

accompanying his intuition because its determining

ground lies perhaps in the concept of that which

may be regarded as the supersensible substrate of

humanity
the solution of an antinomy only depends on

the possibility of showing that two apparently contradictory

propositions do not contradict one another

in fact but that they may be consistent although the

explanation of the possibility of their concept may

transcend our cognitive faculties that this illusion

is natural and unavoidable by human reason and234

also why it is so and remains so although it ceases

to deceive after the analysis of the apparent contradiction

may be thus explained
in the two contradictory judgements we take the

concept on which the universal validity of a judgement

must be based in the same sense and yet we

apply to it two opposite predicates in the thesis

we mean that the judgement of taste is not based

upon determinate concepts and in the antithesis

that the judgement of taste is based upon a concept

but an indeterminate one viz of the supersensible

substrate of phenomena between these two there

is no contradiction
we can do nothing more than remove this

conflict between the claims and counterclaims of

taste it is absolutely impossible to give a definite

objective principle of taste in accordance with

which its judgements could be derived examined

and established for then the judgement would not

be one of taste at all the subjective principle

viz the indefinite idea of the supersensible in us

can only be put forward as the sole key to the

puzzle of this faculty whose sources are hidden

from us it can be made no further intelligible
the proper concept of taste that is of a merely

reflective aesthetical judgement lies at the basis of

the antinomy here exhibited and adjusted thus

the two apparently contradictory principles are

reconciledboth can be true which is sufficient

if on the other hand we assume as some do

pleasantness as the determining ground of taste on

account of the singularity of the representation

which lies at the basis of the judgement of taste or

as others will have it the principle of perfection on

account of the universality of the same and settle235

the definition of taste accordingly then there arises

an antinomy which it is absolutely impossible to

adjust except by showing that both the contrary

though not contradictory propositions are false

and this would prove that the concept on which

they are based is selfcontradictory hence we see

that the removal of the antinomy of the aesthetical

judgement takes a course similar to that pursued by

the critique in the solution of the antinomies of pure

theoretical reason and thus here as also in the

critique of practical reason the antinomies force us

against our will to look beyond the sensible and to

seek in the supersensible the point of union for all

our a priori faculties because no other expedient is

left to make our reason harmonious with itself
remark i
as we so often find occasion in transcendental

philosophy for distinguishing ideas from concepts of

the understanding it may be of use to introduce

technical terms to correspond to this distinction i

believe that no one will object if i propose somein

the most universal signification of the word

ideas are representations referred to an object

according to a certain subjective or objective

principle but so that they can never become a

cognition of it they are either referred to an

intuition according to a merely subjective principle

of the mutual harmony of the cognitive powers

the imagination and the understanding and they

are then called aesthetical or they are referred to

a concept according to an objective principle

although they can never furnish a cognition of the

object and are called rational ideas in the latter236

case the concept is a transcendent one which is

different from a concept of the understanding to

which an adequately corresponding experience can

always be supplied and which therefore is called

immanent
an aesthetical idea cannot become a cognition

because it is an intuition of the imagination for

which an adequate concept can never be found

a rational idea can never become a cognition

because it involves a concept of the supersensible

corresponding to which an intuition can never be

given
now i believe we might call the aesthetical idea

an inexponible representation of the imagination

and a rational idea an indemonstrable concept of

reason it is assumed of both that they are not

generated without grounds but according to the

above explanation of an idea in general in

conformity with certain principles of the cognitive

faculties to which they belong subjective principles

in the one case objective in the other
concepts of the understanding must as such

always be demonstrable if by demonstration we

understand as in anatomy merely presentation101
ie the object corresponding to them must always

be capable of being given in intuition pure or

empirical for thus alone could they become

cognitions the concept of magnitude can be given

a priori in the intuition of space eg of a right line

etc the concept of cause in impenetrability in the

collision of bodies etc consequently both can be

authenticated by means of an empirical intuition ie

the thought of them can be proved demonstrated

verified by an example and this must be possible237

for otherwise we should not be certain that the concept

was not empty ie devoid of any object
in logic we ordinarily use the expressions

demonstrable or indemonstrable only in respect of

propositions but these might be better designated by

the titles respectively of mediately and immediately

certain propositions for pure philosophy has also

propositions of both kinds ie true propositions

some of which are susceptible of proof and others

not it can as philosophy prove them on a priori

grounds but it cannot demonstrate them unless

we wish to depart entirely from the proper meaning

of this word according to which to demonstrate

ostendere exhibere is equivalent to presenting a

concept in intuition whether in proof or merely in

definition if the intuition is a priori this is called

construction but if it is empirical then the object

is displayed by means of which objective reality is

assured to the concept thus we say of an anatomist

that he demonstrates the human eye if by

a dissection of this organ he makes intuitively

evident the concept which he has previously treated

discursively
it hence follows that the rational concept of the

supersensible substrate of all phenomena in general

or even of that which must be placed at the basis of

our arbitrary will in respect of the moral law viz

of transcendental freedom is already in kind an

indemonstrable concept and a rational idea while

virtue is so in degree for there can be given in

experience as regards its quality absolutely nothing

corresponding to the former whereas in the latter

case no empirical product attains to the degree of

that causality which the rational idea prescribes as

the rule
238

as in a rational idea the imagination with its

intuitions does not attain to the given concept so in

an aesthetical idea the understanding by its concepts

never attains completely to that internal intuition

which the imagination binds up with a given

representation since now to reduce a representation

of the imagination to concepts is the same

thing as to expound it the aesthetical idea may be

called an inexponible representation of the imagination

in its free play i shall have occasion in the

sequel to say something more of ideas of this kind

now i only note that both kinds of ideas rational

and aesthetical must have their principles and must

have them in reasonthe one in the objective

the other in the subjective principles of its

employment
we can consequently explain genius as the

faculty of aesthetical ideas by which at the same

time is shown the reason why in the products of

genius it is the nature of the subject and not a

premeditated purpose that gives the rule to the art

of the production of the beautiful for since the

beautiful must not be judged by concepts but by

the purposive attuning of the imagination to

agreement with the faculty of concepts in general it

cannot be rule and precept which can serve as the

subjective standard of that aesthetical but unconditioned

purposiveness in beautiful art that can

rightly claim to please every one it can only be

that in the subject which is nature and cannot be

brought under rules or concepts ie the supersensible

substrate of all his faculties to which

no concept of the understanding extends and

consequently that with respect to which it is the

final purpose given by the intelligible part of our239

nature to harmonise all our cognitive faculties

thus alone is it possible that there should be

a priori at the basis of this purposiveness for which

we can prescribe no objective principle a principle

subjective and yet of universal validity
remark ii
the following important remark occurs here

there are three kinds of antinomies of pure

reason which however all agree in this that they

compel us to give up the otherwise very natural

hypothesis that objects of sense are things in

themselves and force us to regard them merely as

phenomena and to supply to them an intelligible

substrate something supersensible of which the

concept is only an idea and supplies no proper

knowledge without such antinomies reason

could never decide upon accepting a principle

narrowing so much the field of its speculation and

could never bring itself to sacrifices by which so

many otherwise brilliant hopes must disappear

for even now when by way of compensation for

these losses a greater field in a practical aspect

opens out before it it appears not to be able without

grief to part from those hopes and disengage itself

from its old attachment
that there are three kinds of antinomies has its

ground in this that there are three cognitive

facultiesunderstanding judgement and reason

of which each as a superior cognitive faculty must

have its a priori principles for reason in so far

as it judges of these principles and their use

inexorably requires in respect of them all the unconditioned

for the given conditioned and this

can never be found if we consider the sensible as240

belonging to things in themselves and do not

rather supply to it as mere phenomenon something

supersensible the intelligible substrate of nature

both external and internal as the reality in itself

sache an sich selbst there are then 1 for

the cognitive faculty an antinomy of reason in

respect of the theoretical employment of the understanding

extended to the unconditioned 2 for

the feeling of pleasure and pain an antinomy of

reason in respect of the aesthetical employment of

the judgement and 3 for the faculty of desire an

antinomy in respect of the practical employment of

the selflegislative reason so far as all these

faculties have their superior principles a priori and

in conformity with an inevitable requirement of

reason must judge and be able to determine their

object unconditionally according to those principles
as for the two antinomies of the theoretical

and practical employment of the superior cognitive

faculties we have already shown their unavoidableness

if judgements of this kind are not referred to a

supersensible substrate of the given objects as

phenomena and also the possibility of their solution

as soon as this is done and as for the

antinomies in the employment of the judgement in

conformity with the requirements of reason and

their solution which is here given there are only

two ways of avoiding them either we must deny

that any a priori principle lies at the basis of the

aesthetical judgement of taste we must maintain that

all claim to necessary universal agreement is a groundless

and vain fancy and that a judgement of taste

only deserves to be regarded as correct because it

happens that many people agree about it and this

not because we assume an a priori principle behind241

this agreement but because as in the taste of the

palate of the contingent similar organisation of the

different subjects or we must assume that the

judgement of taste is really a disguised judgement

of reason upon the perfection discovered in a thing

and the reference of the manifold in it to a purpose

and is consequently only called aesthetical on

account of the confusion here attaching to our

reflection although it is at bottom teleological in

the latter case we could declare the solution of the

antinomies by means of transcendental ideas to

be needless and without point and thus could

harmonise these laws of taste with objects of sense

not as mere phenomena but as things in themselves

but we have shown in several places in the exposition

of judgements of taste how little either of

these expedients will satisfy
however if it be granted that our deduction at

least proceeds by the right method although it be

not yet plain enough in all its parts three ideas

manifest themselves first there is the idea of

the supersensible in general without any further

determination of it as the substrate of nature

secondly there is the idea of the same as the

principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature

for our cognitive faculty and thirdly there is the

idea of the same as the principle of the purposes

of freedom and of the agreement of freedom with

its purposes in the moral sphere

 58 of the idealism of the purposiveness of both

nature and art as the unique principle of

the aesthetical judgement
to begin with we can either place the principle

of taste in the fact that it always judges in accordance242

with grounds which are empirical and therefore

are only given a posteriori by sense or concede

that it judges on a priori grounds the former

would be the empiricism of the critique of taste

the latter its rationalism according to the former

the object of our satisfaction would not differ from

the pleasant according to the latter if the judgement

rests on definite concepts it would not differ from

the good thus all beauty would be banished from

the world and only a particular name expressing

perhaps a certain mingling of the two abovenamed

kinds of satisfaction would remain in its place but

we have shown that there are also a priori grounds

of satisfaction which can subsist along with the

principle of rationalism although they cannot be

comprehended in definite concepts
on the other hand the rationalism of the principle

of taste is either that of the realism of the

purposiveness or of its idealism because a judgement

of taste is not a cognitive judgement and

beauty is not a characteristic of the object considered

in itself the rationalism of the principle of

taste can never be placed in the fact that the purposiveness

in this judgement is thought as objective

ie that the judgement theoretically and therefore

also logically although only in a confused way

refers to the perfection of the object it only refers

aesthetically to the agreement of the representation

of the object in the imagination with the essential

principles of judgement in general in the subject

consequently even according to the principle of

rationalism the judgement of taste and the distinction

between its realism and idealism can only be

settled thus either in the first case this subjective

purposiveness is assumed as an actual designed243
purpose of nature or art harmonising with our judgement

or in the second case as a purposive harmony

with the needs of judgement in respect of

nature and its forms produced according to particular

laws which shows itself without purpose spontaneously

and contingently
the beautiful formations in the kingdom of

organised nature speak loudly for the realism of the

aesthetical purposiveness of nature since we might

assume that behind the production of the beautiful

there is an idea of the beautiful in the producing

cause viz a purpose in respect of our imagination

flowers blossoms even the shapes of entire plants

the elegance of animal formations of all kinds

unneeded for their proper use but as it were

selected for our taste especially the charming variety

so satisfying to the eye and the harmonious arrangement

of colours in the pheasant in shellfish in

insects even in the commonest flowers which as

it only concerns the surface and not the figure of

these creations though perhaps requisite in regard

of their internal purposes seems to be entirely

designed for external inspection these things give

great weight to that mode of explanation which

assumes actual purposes of nature for our aesthetical

judgement
on the other hand not only is reason opposed

to this assumption in its maxims which bid us always

avoid as far as possible unnecessary multiplication

of principles but nature everywhere shows in its

free formations much mechanical tendency to the

productions of forms which seem as it were to be

made for the aesthetical exercise of our judgement

without affording the least ground for the supposition

that there is need of anything more than its mechanism244

merely as nature according to which without

any idea lying at their root they can be purposive

for our judgement but i understand by free formations

of nature those whereby from a fluid at rest

through the volatilisation or separation of a portion

of its constituents sometimes merely of caloric the

remainder in becoming solid assumes a definite

shape or tissue figure or texture which is different

according to the specific difference of the material

but in the same material is constant here it is

always presupposed that we are speaking of a perfect

fluid ie that the material in it is completely

dissolved and that it is not a mere medley of solid

particles in a state of suspension
formation then takes place by a shooting together

ie by a sudden solidification not by a gradual

transition from the fluid to the solid state but all

at once by a saltus which transition is also called

crystallisation the commonest example of this

kind of formation is the freezing of water where

first icicles are produced which combine at angles

of 60 while others attach themselves to each vertex

until it all becomes ice and so that while this is

going on the water does not gradually become

viscous but is as perfectly fluid as if its temperature

were far higher although it is absolutely icecold

the matter that disengages itself which is dissipated

suddenly at the moment of solidification is a considerable

quantum of caloric the disappearance of

which as it was only required for preserving

fluidity leaves the new ice not in the least colder

than the water which shortly before was fluid
many salts and also rocks of a crystalline

figure are produced thus from a species of earth

dissolved in water we do not exactly know how245

thus are formed the glandular configurations of

many minerals the cubical sulphide of lead the ruby

silver ore etc in all probability in water and by

the shooting together of particles as they become

forced by some cause to dispense with this vehicle

and to unite in definite external shapes
but also all kinds of matter which have been

kept in a fluid state by heat and have become

solid by cooling show internally when fractured a

definite texture this makes us judge that if their

own weight or the disturbance of the air had not

prevented it they would also have exhibited on the

outer surface their specifically peculiar shapes this

has been observed in some metals on their inner

surface which have been hardened externally by

fusion but are fluid in the interior by the drawing

off the internal fluid and the consequent undisturbed

crystallisation of the remainder many of these

mineral crystallisations such as spars hematite

arragonite etc often present beautiful shapes the

like of which art can only conceive and the halo

in the cavern of antiparos102 is merely produced by

water trickling down strata of gypsum
the fluid state is to all appearance older than

the solid state and plants as well as animal bodies

are fashioned out of fluid nutritive matter so far

as this forms itself in a state of rest this last of

course primarily combines and forms itself in freedom

according to a certain original disposition directed

towards purposes which as will be shown in part

ii must not be judged aesthetically but teleologically

according to the principle of realism

but also perhaps in conformity with the universal246

law of the affinity of materials again the watery

fluids dissolved in an atmosphere that is a mixture

of different gases if they separate from the latter

on account of cooling produce snow figures which

in correspondence with the character of the special

mixture of gases often seem very artistic and are

extremely beautiful so without detracting from

the teleological principle by which we judge of

organisation we may well think that the beauty of

flowers of the plumage of birds or of shellfish

both in shape and colour may be ascribed to nature

and its faculty of producing forms in an aesthetically

purposive way in its freedom without particular

purposes adapted thereto according to chemical

laws by the arrangement of the material requisite

for the organisation in question
but what shows the principle of the ideality of

the purposiveness in the beauty of nature as that

which we always place at the basis of an aesthetical

judgement and which allows us to employ as a

ground of explanation for our representative faculty

no realism of purpose is the fact that in judging

beauty we invariably seek its gauge in ourselves

a priori and that our aesthetical judgement is itself

legislative in respect of the judgement whether

anything is beautiful or not this could not be on

the assumption of the realism of the purposiveness

of nature because in that case we must have

learned from nature what we ought to find beautiful

and the aesthetical judgement would be subjected to

empirical principles for in such an act of judging

the important point is not what nature is or even

as a purpose is in relation to us but how we take

it there would be an objective purposiveness in

nature if it had fashioned its forms for our satisfaction247

and not a subjective purposiveness which

depended upon the play of the imagination in its

freedom where it is we who receive nature with

favour not nature which shows us favour the

property of nature that gives us occasion to perceive

the inner purposiveness in the relation of our

mental faculties in judging certain of its productsa

purposiveness which is to be explained on

supersensible grounds as necessary and universalcannot

be a natural purpose or be judged by us as

such for otherwise the judgement hereby determined

would not be free and would have at its basis

heteronomy and not as beseems a judgement of

taste autonomy
in beautiful art the principle of the idealism of

purposiveness is still clearer as in the case of the

beautiful in nature an aesthetical realism of this

purposiveness cannot be perceived by sensations

for then the art would be only pleasant not beautiful

but that the satisfaction produced by aesthetical

ideas must not depend on the attainment of definite

purposes as in mechanically designed art and that

consequently in the very rationalism of the principle

the ideality of the purposes and not their reality

must be fundamental appears from the fact that

beautiful art as such must not be considered as a

product of understanding and science but of genius

and therefore must get its rule through aesthetical

ideas which are essentially different from rational

ideas of definite purposes
just as the ideality of the objects of sense as

phenomena is the only way of explaining the possibility

of their forms being susceptible of a priori

determination so the idealism of purposiveness in

judging the beautiful in nature and art is the only248

hypothesis under which criticism can explain the

possibility of a judgement of taste which demands

a priori validity for every one without grounding

on concepts the purposiveness that is represented in

the object
 59 of beauty as the symbol of morality
intuitions are always required to establish the

reality of our concepts if the concepts are empirical

the intuitions are called examples if they are

pure concepts of understanding the intuitions are

called schemata if we desire to establish the

objective reality of rational concepts ie of ideas

on behalf of theoretical cognition then we are asking

for something impossible because absolutely no intuition

can be given which shall be adequate to

them
all hypotyposis presentation subjectio sub adspectum

or sensible illustration is twofold it is

either schematical when to a concept comprehended

by the understanding the corresponding intuition is

given a priori or it is symbolical in the latter case

to a concept only thinkable by the reason to which

no sensible intuition can be adequate an intuition is

supplied with which accords a procedure of the judgement

analogous to what it observes in schematism

it accords with it that is in respect of the rule of

this procedure merely not of the intuition itself

consequently in respect of the form of reflection

merely and not of its content
there is a use of the word symbolical that has

been adopted by modern logicians which is misleading

and incorrect ie to speak of the symbolical

mode of representation as if it were opposed to the249
intuitive for the symbolical is only a mode of the

intuitive the latter the intuitive that is may

be divided into the schematical and the symbolical

modes of representation both are hypotyposes ie

presentations exhibitiones not mere characterisations

or designations of concepts by accompanying

sensible signs which contain nothing belonging to

the intuition of the object and only serve as a

means for reproducing the concepts according to

the law of association of the imagination and consequently

in a subjective point of view these are

either words or visible algebraical even mimetical

signs as mere expressions for concepts103
all intuitions which we supply to concepts a

priori are therefore either schemata or symbols of

which the former contain direct the latter indirect

presentations of the concept the former do this

demonstratively the latter by means of an analogy

for which we avail ourselves even of empirical

intuitions in which the judgement exercises a double

function first applying the concept to the object

of a sensible intuition and then applying the mere

rule of the reflection made upon that intuition to a

quite different object of which the first is only the

symbol thus a monarchical state is represented

by a living body if it is governed by national

laws and by a mere machine like a handmill if

governed by an individual absolute will but in both

cases only symbolically for between a despotic

state and a handmill there is to be sure no similarity

but there is a similarity in the rules according

to which we reflect upon these two things and their250

causality this matter has not been sufficiently

analysed hitherto for it deserves a deeper investigation

but this is not the place to linger over it our

language ie german is full of indirect presentations

of this sort in which the expression does not

contain the proper schema for the concept but

merely a symbol for reflection thus the words

ground support basis to depend to be held up from

above to flow from something instead of to follow

substance as locke expresses it the support of

accidents and countless others are not schematical

but symbolical hypotyposes and expressions for concepts

not by means of a direct intuition but only

by analogy with it ie by the transference of reflection

upon an object of intuition to a quite different

concept to which perhaps an intuition can never

directly correspond if we are to give the name of

cognition to a mere mode of representation which

is quite permissible if the latter is not a principle of

the theoretical determination of what an object is in

itself but of the practical determination of what the

idea of it should be for us and for its purposive use

then all our knowledge of god is merely symbolical

and he who regards it as schematical along with the

properties of understanding will etc which only

establish their objective reality in beings of this

world falls into anthropomorphism just as he who

gives up every intuitive element falls into deism by

which nothing at all is cognised not even in a

practical point of view
now i say the beautiful is the symbol of the

morally good and that it is only in this respect a

reference which is natural to every man and which

every man postulates in others as a duty that it

gives pleasure with a claim for the agreement of251

every one else by this the mind is made conscious

of a certain ennoblement and elevation above the

mere sensibility to pleasure received through sense

and the worth of others is estimated in accordance

with a like maxim of their judgement that is the

intelligible to which as pointed out in the preceding

paragraph taste looks with which our higher

cognitive faculties are in accord and without which

a downright contradiction would arise between their

nature and the claims made by taste in this

faculty the judgement does not see itself as in empirical

judging subjected to a heteronomy of empirical

laws it gives the law to itself in respect of the

objects of so pure a satisfaction just as the reason

does in respect of the faculty of desire hence

both on account of this inner possibility in the

subject and of the external possibility of a nature

that agrees with it it finds itself to be referred to

something within the subject as well as without him

something which is neither nature nor freedom but

which yet is connected with the supersensible ground

of the latter in this supersensible ground therefore

the theoretical faculty is bound together in

unity with the practical in a way which though

common is yet unknown we shall indicate some

points of this analogy while at the same time we

shall note the differences
1 the beautiful pleases immediately but only

in reflective intuition not like morality in its

concept 2 it pleases apart from any interest

the morally good is indeed necessarily bound up

with an interest though not with one which precedes

the judgement upon the satisfaction but with one

which is first of all produced by it 3 the

freedom of the imagination and therefore of the252

sensibility of our faculty is represented in judging

the beautiful as harmonious with the conformity to

law of the understanding in the moral judgement

the freedom of the will is thought as the harmony

of the latter with itself according to universal laws

of reason 4 the subjective principle in judging

the beautiful is represented as universal ie as valid

for every man though not cognisable through any

universal concept the objective principle of morality

is also expounded as universal ie for every

subject and for every action of the same subject and

thus as cognisable by means of a universal concept

hence the moral judgement is not only susceptible of

definite constitutive principles but is possible only by

grounding its maxims on these in their universality
a reference to this analogy is usual even with

the common understanding of men and we often

describe beautiful objects of nature or art by names

that seem to put a moral appreciation at their basis

we call buildings or trees majestic and magnificent

landscapes laughing and gay even colours are

called innocent modest tender because they excite

sensations which have something analogous to the

consciousness of the state of mind brought about

by moral judgements taste makes possible the

transition without any violent leap from the charm

of sense to habitual moral interest for it represents

the imagination in its freedom as capable of purposive

determination for the understanding and so

teaches us to find even in objects of sense a free

satisfaction apart from any charm of sense

253
appendix 60 of the method of taste
the division of a critique into elementology

and methodology as preparatory to science is not

applicable to the critique of taste because there

neither is nor can be a science of the beautiful

and the judgement of taste is not determinable by

means of principles as for the scientific element

in every art which regards truth in the presentation

of its object this is indeed the indispensable

condition conditio sine qua non of beautiful art

but not beautiful art itself there is therefore for

beautiful art only a manner modus not a method

of teaching methodus the master must show

what the pupil is to do and how he is to do it and

the universal rules under which at last he brings

his procedure serve rather for bringing the main

points back to his remembrance when occasion

requires than for prescribing them to him nevertheless

regard must be had here to a certain ideal

which art must have before its eyes although it

cannot be completely attained in practice it is

only through exciting the imagination of the pupil

to accordance with a given concept by making him

note the inadequacy of the expression for the idea

to which the concept itself does not attain because

it is an aesthetical idea and by severe criticism that

he can be prevented from taking the examples set

before him as types and models for imitation to

be subjected to no higher standard or independent

judgement it is thus that genius and with it the

freedom of the imagination is stifled by its very254

conformity to law and without these no beautiful

art and not even an accurately judging individual

taste is possible
the propaedeutic to all beautiful art regarded in

the highest degree of its perfection seems to lie

not in precepts but in the culture of the mental

powers by means of those elements of knowledge

called humaniora probably because humanity on the

one side indicates the universal feeling of sympathy

and on the other the faculty of being able to communicate

universally our inmost feelings for

these properties taken together constitute the characteristic

social spirit104 of humanity by which it is

distinguished from the limitations of animal life

the age and peoples in which the impulse towards

a lawabiding social life by which a people becomes

a permanent community contended with the great

difficulties presented by the difficult problem of

uniting freedom and therefore equality also with

compulsion rather of respect and submission from a

sense of duty than of fearsuch an age and such a

people naturally first found out the art of reciprocal

communication of ideas between the cultivated and

uncultivated classes and thus discovered how to

harmonise the largemindedness and refinement of

the former with the natural simplicity and originality

of the latter in this way they first found that

mean between the higher culture and simple nature

which furnishes that true standard for taste as a

sense common to all men which no universal rules

can supply
with difficulty will a later age dispense with

those models because it will be always farther255

from nature and in fine without having permanent

examples before it a concept will hardly be possible

in one and the same people of the happy union of

the lawabiding constraint of the highest culture with

the force and truth of free nature which feels its own

proper worth
now taste is at bottom a faculty for judging of

the sensible illustration of moral ideas by means

of a certain analogy involved in our reflection upon

both these and it is from this faculty also and

from the greater susceptibility grounded thereon

for the feeling arising from the latter called moral

feeling that the pleasure is derived which taste

regards as valid for mankind in general and not

merely for the private feeling of each hence

it appears plain that the true propaedeutic for the

foundation of taste is the development of moral

ideas and the culture of the moral feeling because

it is only when sensibility is brought into agreement

with this that genuine taste can assume a definite

invariable form

257

 the critique of judgement
part ii
critique of the teleological judgement
259
 61 of the objective purposiveness of nature
we have on transcendental principles good

ground to assume a subjective purposiveness in

nature in its particular laws in reference to its

comprehensibility by human judgement and to the

possibility of the connexion of particular experiences

in a system this may be expected as possible in

many products of nature which as if they were

devised quite specially for our judgement contain

a specific form conformable thereto which through

their manifoldness and unity serve at once to

strengthen and to sustain the mental powers that

come into play in the employment of this faculty

and to which therefore we give the name of beautiful

forms
but that the things of nature serve one another

as means to purposes and that their possibility is

only completely intelligible through this kind of

causalityfor this we have absolutely no ground in

the universal idea of nature as the complex of the

objects of sense in the abovementioned case the

representation of things because it is something in

ourselves can be quite well thought a priori as

suitable and useful for the internally purposive

determination of our cognitive faculties but that

purposes which neither are our own nor belong to

nature for we do not regard nature as an intelligent260

being could or should constitute a particular kind of

causality at least a quite special conformity to lawthis

we have absolutely no a priori reason for

presuming yet more experience itself cannot prove

to us the actuality of this there must then have

preceded a rationalising subtlety which only sportively

introduces the concept of purpose into the

nature of things but which does not derive it from

objects or from their empirical cognition to this

latter it is of more service to make nature comprehensible

according to analogy with the subjective

ground of the connexion of our representations

than to cognise it from objective grounds
further objective purposiveness as a principle

of the possibility of things of nature is so far removed

from necessary connexion with the concept

of nature that it is much oftener precisely that upon

which one relies to prove the contingency of nature

and of its form when eg we adduce the structure

of a bird the hollowness of its bones the

disposition of its wings for motion and of its tail for

steering etc we say that all this is contingent in the

highest degree according to the mere nexus effectivus

of nature without calling in the aid of a particular

kind of causality namely that of purpose nexus

finalis in other words nature considered as mere

mechanism could have produced its forms in a

thousand other ways without stumbling upon the

unity which is in accordance with such a principle

it is not in the concept of nature but quite apart

from it that we can hope to find the least ground

a priori for this
nevertheless the teleological act of judgement is

rightly brought to bear at least problematically

upon the investigation of nature but only in order261

to bring it under principles of observation and

inquiry according to the analogy with the causality

of purpose without any pretence to explain it thereby

it belongs therefore to the reflective and not

to the determinant judgement the concept of combinations

and forms of nature in accordance with

purposes is then at least one principle more for

bringing its phenomena under rules where the laws

of simply mechanical causality do not suffice for

we bring in a teleological ground where we attribute

causality in respect of an object to the concept of

an object as if it were to be found in nature not

in ourselves or rather when we represent to ourselves

the possibility of the object after the analogy

of that causality which we experience in ourselves

and consequently think nature technically as through

a special faculty if we did not ascribe to it such

a method of action its causality would have to be

represented as blind mechanism if on the contrary

we supply to nature causes acting designedly

and consequently place at its basis teleology

not merely as a regulative principle for the mere

judging of phenomena to which nature can be

thought as subject in its particular laws but as a

constitutive principle of the derivation of its products

from their causes then would the concept of a

natural purpose no longer belong to the reflective

but to the determinant judgement then in fact it

would not belong specially to the judgement like

the concept of beauty regarded as formal subjective

purposiveness but as a rational concept it would

introduce into natural science a new causality

which we only borrow from ourselves and ascribe

to other beings without meaning to assume them

to be of the same kind with ourselves

262

first division
analytic of the teleological judgement
 62 of the objective purposiveness which is merely

formal as distinguished from that which is material
all geometrical figures drawn on a principle

display a manifold oft admired objective purposiveness

ie in reference to their usefulness for the

solution of several problems by a single principle

or of the same problem in an infinite variety of

ways the purposiveness is here obviously objective

and intellectual not merely subjective and

aesthetical for it expresses the suitability of the

figure for the production of many intended figures

and is cognised through reason but this purposiveness

does not make the concept of the object

itself possible ie it is not regarded as possible

merely with reference to this use
in so simple a figure as the circle lies the key

to the solution of a multitude of problems each of

which would demand various appliances whereas

the solution results of itself as it were as one of

the infinite number of elegant properties of this

figure are we for example asked to construct a

triangle being given the base and vertical angle

the problem is indeterminate ie it can be solved

in an infinite number of ways but the circle

embraces them altogether as the geometrical locus263

of the vertices of triangles satisfying the given

conditions again suppose that two lines are to

cut one another so that the rectangle under the

segments of the one should be equal to the rectangle

under the segments of the other the solution

of the problem from this point of view presents

much difficulty but all chords intersecting inside

a circle divide one another in this proportion other

curved lines suggest other purposive solutions of

which nothing was thought in the rule that furnished

their construction all conic sections in themselves

and when compared with one another are fruitful

in principles for the solution of a number of possible

problems however simple is the definition which

determines their conceptit is a true joy to see

the zeal with which the old geometers investigated

the properties of lines of this class without allowing

themselves to be led astray by the questions of narrowminded

persons as to what use this knowledge

would be thus they worked out the properties of

the parabola without knowing the law of gravitation

which would have suggested to them its application

to the trajectory of heavy bodies for the motion of

a heavy body can be seen to be parallel to the curve

of a parabola again they found out the properties

of an ellipse without surmising that any of the

heavenly bodies had weight and without knowing

the law of force at different distances from the point

of attraction which causes it to describe this curve

in free motion while they thus unconsciously

worked for the science of the future they delighted

themselves with a purposiveness in the essential

being of things which yet they were able to present

completely a priori in its necessity plato himself

master of this science hinted at such an original264

constitution of things in the discovery of which we

can dispense with all experience and at the power

of the mind to produce from its supersensible principle

the harmony of beings where the properties

of number come in with which the mind plays in

music this he touches upon in the inspiration

that raised him above the concepts of experience to

ideas which seem to him to be explicable only

through an intellectual affinity with the origin of all

beings no wonder that he banished from his

school the man who was ignorant of geometry since

he thought he could derive from pure intuition

which has its home in the human spirit that which

anaxagoras drew from empirical objects and their

purposive combination for in the very necessity

of that which is purposive and is constituted just as

if it were designedly intended for our usebut at

the same time seems to belong originally to the

being of things without any reference to our uselies

the ground of our great admiration of nature

and that not so much external as in our own reason

it is surely excusable that this admiration should

through misunderstanding gradually rise to the

height of fanaticism
but this intellectual purposiveness although no

doubt objective not subjective like aesthetical

purposiveness is in reference to its possibility

merely formal not real it can only be conceived

as purposiveness in general without any definite

purpose being assumed as its basis and consequently

without teleology being needed for it the figure of

a circle is an intuition which is determined by means

of the understanding according to a principle

the unity of this principle which i arbitrarily

assume and use as fundamental concept applied to265

a form of intuition space which is met with in

myself as a representation and yet a priori renders

intelligible the unity of many rules resulting from

the construction of that concept which are purposive

for many possible designs but this purposiveness

does not imply a purpose or any other ground whatever

it is quite different if i meet with order and

regularity in complexes of things external to myself

enclosed within certain boundaries as eg in

a garden the order and regularity of the trees

flowerbeds and walks these i cannot expect to

derive a priori from my bounding of space made

after a rule of my own for this order and regularity

are existing things which must be given empirically

in order to be known and not a mere representation

in myself determined a priori according to a principle

so then the latter empirical purposiveness

as real is dependent on the concept of a purpose
but the ground of admiration for a perceived

purposiveness although it be in the being of things

so far as their concepts can be constructed may

very well be seen and seen to be legitimate

the manifold rules whose unity derived from a

principle excites admiration are all synthetical

and do not follow from the concept of the object

eg of a circle but require this object to be given

in intuition hence this unity gets the appearance

of having empirically an external basis of rules

distinct from our representative faculty as if therefore

the correspondence of the object to that need

of rules which is proper to the understanding were

contingent in itself and therefore only possible

by means of a purpose expressly directed thereto

now because this harmony notwithstanding all this

purposiveness is not cognised empirically but a266

priori it should bring us of itself to this pointthat

space through whose determination by means

of the imagination in accordance with a concept

the object is alone possible is not a characteristic

of things external to me but a mere mode of representation

in myself hence in the figure which i

draw in conformity with a concept ie in my own

mode of representing that which is given to me

externally whatever it may be in itself it is i that

introduce the purposiveness i get no empirical instruction

from the object about the purposiveness

and so i require in it no particular purpose external

to myself but because this consideration already

calls for a critical employment of reason and consequently

cannot be involved in the judging of the

object according to its properties so this latter

judging suggests to me immediately nothing but

the unification of heterogeneous rules even according

to their very diversity in a principle this

principle without requiring any particular a priori

basis external to my concept or indeed generally

speaking to my representation is yet cognised

a priori by me as true now wonder is a shock of

the mind arising from the incompatibility of a

representation and the rule given by its means

with the principles already lying at its basis which

provokes a doubt as to whether we have rightly

seen or rightly judged admiration however is

wonder which ever recurs despite the disappearance

of this doubt consequently the latter is a quite

natural effect of that observed purposiveness in the

being of things as phenomena it cannot indeed

be censured whilst the unification of the form of

sensible intuition spacewith the faculty of concepts

the understandingis inexplicable to us267

and that not only on account of the union being

just of the kind that it is but because it is enlarging

for the mind to surmise the existence of

something lying outside our sensible representations

in which although unknown to us the ultimate

ground of that agreement may be met with we

are it is true not necessitated to cognise this if we

have only to do a priori with the formal purposiveness

of our representations but the fact that we

are compelled to look out beyond it inspires at the

same time an admiration for the object that impels

us thereto
we are accustomed to speak of the abovementioned

properties of geometrical figures or of

numbers as beautiful on account of a certain a priori

purposiveness they have for all kinds of cognitive

uses this purposiveness being quite unexpected on

account of the simplicity of the construction we

speak eg of this or that beautiful property of the

circle which was discovered in this or that way

but there is no aesthetical act of judgement through

which we find it purposive no act of judgement

without a concept which renders noticeable a mere

subjective purposiveness in the free play of our

cognitive faculties but an intellectual act according

to concepts which enables us clearly to cognise an

objective purposiveness ie availableness for all

kinds of infinitely manifold purposes we must

rather call this relative perfection than a beauty of

the mathematical figure to speak thus of an intellectual

beauty cannot in general be permissible

for otherwise the word beauty would lose all determinate

significance or the intellectual satisfaction

all superiority over the sensible we should rather

call a demonstration of such properties beautiful268

because through it the understanding as the faculty

of concepts and the imagination as the faculty of

presenting them feel themselves strengthened a

priori this when viewed in connexion with the

precision introduced by reason is spoken of as

elegant here however the satisfaction although

it is based on concepts is subjective while perfection

brings with itself an objective satisfaction
 63 of the relative as distinguished from the

inner purposiveness of nature
experience leads our judgement to the concept of

an objective and material purposiveness ie to the

concept of a purpose of nature only when105 we have

to judge of a relation of cause to effect which we

find ourselves able to apprehend as legitimate only

by presupposing the idea of the effect of the

causality of the cause as the fundamental condition

in the cause of the possibility of the effect

this can take place in two ways we may regard

the effect directly as an art product or only as

material for the art of other possible natural beings

in other words either as a purpose or as a means

towards the purposive employment of other causes

this latter purposiveness is called utility for man

or mere advantage for other creatures and is

merely relative while the former is an inner purposiveness

of the natural being
for example rivers bring down with them all

kinds of earth serviceable for the growth of plants269

which sometimes is deposited inland often also at

their mouths the tide brings this mud to many

coasts over the land or deposits it on the shore

and so more especially if men give their aid so

that the ebb shall not carry it back again the fruitbearing

land increases in area and the vegetable

kingdom gains the place which formerly was the

habitation of fish and shells in this way has nature

itself brought about most of the extensions of the

land and still continues to do so although very

slowlynow the question is whether this is to

be judged a purpose of nature because it contains

utility for men we cannot put it down to the

account of the vegetable kingdom because just as

much is subtracted from sealife as is added to

landlife
or to give an example of the advantageousness

of certain natural things as means for other creatures

if we suppose them to be means no soil is more

suitable to pine trees than a sandy soil now the

deep sea before it withdrew from the land left

behind large tracts of sand in our northern regions

so that on this soil so unfavourable for all cultivation

widely extended pine forests were enabled to

grow for the unreasoning destruction of which

we frequently blame our ancestors we may ask if

this original deposit of tracts of sand was a purpose

of nature for the benefit of the possible pine forests

so much is clear that if we regard this as a purpose

of nature we must also regard the sand as a

relative purpose in reference to which the ocean

strand and its withdrawal were means for in the

series of the mutually subordinated members of a

purposive combination every member must be

regarded as a purpose though not as a final270

purpose to which its proximate cause is the means

so too if cattle sheep horses etc are to exist

there must be grass on the earth but there must

also be saline plants in the desert if camels are to

thrive and again these and other herbivorous

animals must be met with in numbers if there

are to be wolves tigers and lions consequently

the objective purposiveness which is based upon

advantage is not an objective purposiveness of

things in themselves as if the sand could not be

conceived for itself as an effect of a cause viz the

sea without attributing to the latter a purpose and

regarding the effect namely the sand as a work

of art it is a merely relative purposiveness contingent

upon the thing to which it is ascribed

and although in the examples we have cited the

different kinds of grass are to be judged as in

themselves organised products of nature and consequently

as artificial yet are they to be regarded

in reference to the beasts which feed upon them as

mere raw material
but above all though man through the freedom

of his causality finds certain natural things of

advantage for his designsdesigns often foolish

such as using the variegated plumage of birds to

adorn his clothes or coloured earths and the juices

of plants for painting his face often again reasonable

as when the horse is used for riding the ox

or as in minorca the ass or pig for ploughingyet

we cannot even here assume a relative natural

purpose for his reason knows how to give things

a conformity with his own arbitrary fancies for which

he was not at all predestined by nature only if

we assume that men are to live upon the earth then

the means must be there without which they could271

not exist as animals and even as rational animals

in however low a degree of rationality and thereupon

those natural things which are indispensable in

this regard must be considered as natural purposes
we can hence easily see that external purposiveness

advantage of one thing in respect of others

can be regarded as an external natural purpose only

under the condition that the existence of that

being to which it is immediately or distantly

advantageous is in itself a purpose of nature

since that can never be completely determined by

mere contemplation of nature it follows that relative

purposiveness although it hypothetically gives

indications of natural purposes yet justifies no

absolute teleological judgement
snow in cold countries protects the crops from

the frost it makes human intercourse easier by

means of sleighs the laplander finds in his

country animals by whose aid this intercourse is

brought about ie reindeer who find sufficient

sustenance in a dry moss which they have to

scratch out for themselves from under the snow

and who are easily tamed and readily permit themselves

to be deprived of that freedom in which they

could have remained if they chose for other

people in the same frozen regions marine animals

afford rich stores in addition to the food and

clothing which are thus supplied and the wood

which is floated in by the sea to their dwellings

these marine animals provide material for fuel by

which their huts are warmed here is a wonderful

concurrence of many references of nature to one

purpose and all this applies to the cases of the

greenlander the lapp the samoyede the inhabitant

of yakutsk etc but then we do not see why272

generally men must live there at all therefore to say

that vapour falls out of the atmosphere in the form of

snow that the sea has its currents which float down

wood that has grown in warmer lands and that

there are in it great sea monsters filled with oil

because the idea of advantage for certain poor

creatures is fundamental for the cause which collects

all these natural products would be a very venturesome

and arbitrary judgement for even if there

were none of this natural utility we should miss

nothing as regards the adequateness of natural

causes to natures constitution much more even to

desire such a tendency in and to attribute such a

purpose to nature would be the part of a presumptuous

and inconsiderate fancy for indeed it might

be observed that it could only have been the greatest

unsociability among men which thus scattered

them into such inhospitable regions
 64 of the peculiar character of things as

natural purposes
in order to see that a thing is only possible as a

purpose that is to be forced to seek the causality of

its origin not in the mechanism of nature but in a

cause whose faculty of action is determined through

concepts it is requisite that its form be not possible

according to mere natural laws ie laws which can

be cognised by us through the understanding alone

when applied to objects of sense but that even the

empirical knowledge of it as regards its cause and

effect presupposes concepts of reason this contingency

of its form in all empirical natural laws in

reference to reason affords a ground for regarding

its causality as possible only through reason for273

reason which must cognise the necessity of every

form of a natural product in order to comprehend

even the conditions of its genesis cannot assume

such natural necessity in that particular given form

the causality of its origin is then referred to the

faculty of acting in accordance with purposes a

will and the object which can only thus be represented

as possible is represented as a purpose
if in a seemingly uninhabited country a man

perceived a geometrical figure say a regular hexagon

inscribed on the sand his reflection busied with such

a concept would attribute although obscurely the

unity in the principle of its genesis to reason and

consequently would not regard as a ground of the

possibility of such a shape the sand or the neighbouring

sea or the winds or beasts with familiar

footprints or any other irrational cause for the

chance against meeting with such a concept which

is only possible through reason would seem so

infinitely great that it would be just as if there were

no natural law no cause in the mere mechanical

working of nature capable of producing it but as

if only the concept of such an object as a concept

which reason alone can supply and with which it

can compare the thing could contain the causality

for such an effect this then would be regarded as

a purpose but as a product of art not as a natural

purpose vestigium hominis video106
but in order to regard a thing cognised as a

natural product as a purpose alsoconsequently as a

natural purpose if this is not a contradictionsomething274

more is required i would say provisionally

a thing exists as a natural purpose if it is although

in a double sense107 both cause and effect of itself

for herein lies a causality the like of which cannot

be combined with the mere concept of a nature without

attributing to it a purpose it can certainly be

thought without contradiction but cannot be comprehended

we shall elucidate the determination

of this idea of a natural purpose by an example

before we analyse it completely
in the first place a tree generates another tree

according to a known natural law but the tree

produced is of the same genus and so it produces

itself generically on the one hand as effect it

is continually selfproduced on the other hand as

cause it continually produces itself and so perpetuates

itself generically
secondly a tree produces itself as an individual

this kind of effect no doubt we call growth but

it is quite different from any increase according to

mechanical laws and is to be reckoned as generation

though under another name the matter that the

tree incorporates it previously works up into a specifically

peculiar quality which natural mechanism external

to it cannot supply and thus it develops itself

by aid of a material which as compounded is its own

product no doubt as regards the constituents got

from nature without it must only be regarded as

an educt but yet in the separation and recombination

of this raw material we see such an originality

in the separating and formative faculty of this kind

of natural being as is infinitely beyond the reach

of art if the attempt is made to reconstruct such

vegetable products out of elements obtained by275

their dissection or material supplied by nature for

their sustenance
thirdly each part of a tree generates itself in

such a way that the maintenance of any one part

depends reciprocally on the maintenance of the rest

a bud of one tree engrafted on the twig of another

produces in the alien stock a plant of its own kind

and so also a scion engrafted on a foreign stem

hence we may regard each twig or leaf of the same

tree as merely engrafted or inoculated into it and

so as an independent tree attached to another and

parasitically nourished by it at the same time

while the leaves are products of the tree they also in

turn give support to it for the repeated defoliation

of a tree kills it and its growth thus depends on

the action of the leaves upon the stem the selfhelp

of nature in case of injury in the vegetable

creation when the want of a part that is necessary

for the maintenance of its neighbours is supplied

by the remaining parts and the abortions or malformations

in growth in which certain parts on

account of casual defects or hindrances form themselves

in a new way to maintain what exists and so

produce an anomalous creature i shall only mention

in passing though they are among the most wonderful

properties of organised creatures
 65 things regarded as natural purposes are

organised beings
according to the character alleged in the preceding

section a thing which though a natural product

is to be cognised as only possible as a natural

purpose must bear itself alternately as cause and as

effect this however is a somewhat inexact and276

indeterminate expression which needs derivation

from a determinate concept
causal combination as thought merely by the

understanding is a connexion constituting an everprogressive

series of causes and effects and things

which as effects presuppose others as causes cannot be

reciprocally at the same time causes of these this

sort of causal combination we call that of effective

causes nexus effectivus but on the other hand a

causal combination according to a concept of reason

of purposes can also be thought which regarded

as a series would lead either forwards or backwards

in this the thing that has been called the effect

may with equal propriety be termed the cause of

that of which it is the effect in the practical

department of human art we easily find connexions

such as this eg a house no doubt is the cause of

the money received for rent but also conversely

the representation of this possible income was the

cause of building the house such a causal connexion

we call that of final causes nexus finalis we

may perhaps suitably name the first the connexion

of real causes the second of those which are ideal

because from this nomenclature it is at once comprehended

that there can be no more than these two

kinds of causality
for a thing to be a natural purpose in the first

place it is requisite that its parts as regards their

being and their form are only possible through

their reference to the whole for the thing itself is

a purpose and so is comprehended under a concept

or an idea which must determine a priori all that

is to be contained in it but so far as a thing is

only thought as possible in this way it is a mere

work of art ie a product of one rational cause277

distinct from the matter of the parts whose

causality in the collection and combination of the

parts is determined through its idea of a whole

possible by their means and consequently not

through external nature
but if a thing as a natural product is to involve

in itself and in its internal possibility a reference to

purposesie to be possible only as a natural purpose

and without the causality of the concepts of

rational beings external to itselfthen it is requisite

secondly that its parts should so combine in the unity

of a whole that they are reciprocally cause and effect

of each others form only in this way can the idea

of the whole conversely reciprocally determine the

form and combination of all the parts not indeed as

causefor then it would be an artificial productbut

as the ground of cognition for him who is

judging it of the systematic unity and combination

of all the manifold contained in the given material
for a body then which is to be judged in itself

and its internal possibility as a natural purpose it

is requisite that its parts mutually depend upon each

other both as to their form and their combination

and so produce a whole by their own causality

while conversely the concept of the whole may be

regarded as its cause according to a principle in a

being possessing a causality according to concepts

adequate to such a product in this case then the

connexion of effective causes may be judged as an

effect through final causes
in such a product of nature every part not only

exists by means of the other parts but is thought as

existing for the sake of the others and the whole

that is as an organic instrument thus however

it might be an artificial instrument and so might be278

represented only as a purpose that is possible in

general but also its parts are all organs reciprocally

producing each other this can never be the case

with artificial instruments but only with nature which

supplies all the material for instruments even for

those of art only a product of such a kind can

be called a natural purpose and this because it is

an organised and selforganising being
in a watch one part is the instrument for moving

the other parts but the wheel is not the effective

cause of the production of the others no doubt one

part is for the sake of the others but it does not

exist by their means in this case the producing

cause of the parts and of their form is not contained

in the nature of the material but is external to it in

a being which can produce effects according to ideas

of a whole possible by means of its causality hence

a watch wheel does not produce other wheels still

less does one watch produce other watches utilising

organising foreign material for that purpose hence

it does not replace of itself parts of which it has been

deprived nor does it make good what is lacking in

a first formation by the addition of the missing parts

nor if it has gone out of order does it repair itselfall

of which on the contrary we may expect from

organised naturean organised being is then not

a mere machine for that has merely moving power

but it possesses in itself formative power of a selfpropagating

kind which it communicates to its

materials though they have it not of themselves

it organises them in fact and this cannot be explained

by the mere mechanical faculty of motion
we say of nature and its faculty in organised

products far too little if we describe it as an analogon

of art for this suggests an artificer a rational being279

external to it much rather does it organise itself

and its organised products in every species no doubt

after one general pattern but yet with suitable deviations

which selfpreservation demands according to

circumstances we perhaps approach nearer to this

inscrutable property if we describe it as an analogon

of life but then we must either endow matter as

mere matter with a property which contradicts

its very being hylozoism or associate therewith an

alien principle standing in communion with it a

soul but in the latter case we must if such a

product is to be a natural product either presuppose

organised matter as the instrument of that soul

which does not make the soul a whit more comprehensible

or regard the soul as artificer of this

structure and so remove the product from corporeal

nature to speak strictly then the organisation of

nature has in it nothing analogous to any causality

we know108 beauty in nature can be rightly described

as an analogon of art because it is ascribed to objects

only in reference to reflection upon their external

aspect and consequently only on account of the

form of their external surface but internal natural

perfection as it belongs to those things which are

only possible as natural purposes and are therefore

called organised beings is not analogous to any

physical ie natural faculty known to us nay even280

regarding ourselves as in the widest sense belonging

to nature it is not even thinkable or explicable by

means of any exactly fitting analogy to human art
the concept of a thing as in itself a natural

purpose is therefore no constitutive concept of

understanding or of reason but it can serve as a

regulative concept for the reflective judgement to

guide our investigation about objects of this kind

by a distant analogy with our own causality according

to purposes generally and in our meditations

upon their ultimate ground this latter use however

is not in reference to the knowledge of nature or of

its original ground but rather to our own practical

faculty of reason in analogy with which we considered

the cause of that purposiveness
organised beings are then the only beings in

nature which considered in themselves and apart

from any relation to other things can be thought as

possible only as purposes of nature hence they

first afford objective reality to the concept of a

purpose of nature as distinguished from a practical

purpose and so they give to the science of nature the

basis for a teleology ie a mode of judgement about

natural objects according to a special principle

which otherwise we should in no way be justified

in introducing because we cannot see a priori the

possibility of this kind of causality
 66 of the principle of judging of internal

purposiveness in organised beings
this principle which is at the same time a

definition is as follows an organised product of

nature is one in which every part is reciprocally

purpose end and means in it nothing is vain without281

purpose or to be ascribed to a blind mechanism

of nature
this principle as regards its occasion is doubtless

derived from experience viz from that methodised

experience called observation but on account of

the universality and necessity which it ascribes to

such purposiveness it cannot rest solely on empirical

grounds but must have at its basis an a priori

principle although it be merely regulative and

these purposes lie only in the idea of the judging

subject and not in an effective cause we may

therefore describe the aforesaid principle as a maxim

for judging of the internal purposiveness of organised

beings
it is an acknowledged fact that the dissectors

of plants and animals in order to investigate their

structure and to find out the reasons why and for

what end such parts such a disposition and combination

of parts and just such an internal form

have been given them assume as indisputably necessary

the maxim that nothing in such a creature is

vain just as they lay down as the fundamental

proposition of the universal science of nature that

nothing happens by chance in fact they can as little

free themselves from this teleological proposition

as from the universal physical proposition for as

without the latter we should have no experience

at all so without the former we should have no

guiding thread for the observation of a species

of natural things which we have thought teleologically

under the concept of natural purposes
now this concept brings the reason into a

quite different order of things from that of a mere

mechanism of nature which is no longer satisfying

here an idea is to be the ground of the possibility282

of the natural product but because this is an

absolute unity of representation instead of the

material being a plurality of things that can supply

by itself no definite unity of compositionif that unity

of the idea is to serve at all as the a priori ground

of determination of a natural law of the causality of

such a form of compositionthe purpose of nature

must be extended to everything included in its

product for if we once refer action of this sort

on the whole to any supersensible ground of determination

beyond the blind mechanism of nature

we must judge of it altogether according to this

principle and we have then no reason to regard

the form of such a thing as partly dependent on

mechanismfor by such mixing up of disparate

principles no certain rule of judging would be left
for example it may be that in an animal body

many parts can be conceived as concretions according

to mere mechanical laws as the hide the bones

the hair and yet the cause which brings together

the required matter modifies it forms it and puts

it in its appropriate place must always be judged

of teleologically so that here everything must be

considered as organised and everything again in

a certain relation to the thing itself is an organ
 67 of the principle of the teleological judging

of nature in general as a system of purposes
we have already said above that the external

purposiveness of natural things affords no sufficient

warrant for using them as purposes of nature in

order to explain their presence and for regarding

their contingently purposive effects as the grounds

of their presence according to the principle of final283

causes thus we cannot take for natural purposes

rivers because they promote intercourse among

inland peoples mountains because they contain the

sources of the rivers and for their maintenance in

rainless seasons have a store of snow or the slope

of the land which carries away the water and leaves

the country dry because although this shape of the

earths surface be very necessary for the origin and

maintenance of the vegetable and animal kingdoms

it has nothing in itself for the possibility of which

we are forced to assume a causality according to

purposes the same is true of plants which man

uses for his needs or his pleasures of beasts the

camel the ox the horse dog etc which are indispensable

to him as well for food as because they

are used in his service in many different ways in

the case of things which we have no reason for

regarding in themselves as purposes such external

relation can only be hypothetically judged as purposive
to judge of a thing as a natural purpose on

account of its internal form is something very

different from taking the existence of that thing to

be a purpose of nature for the latter assertion

we require not merely the concept of a possible

purpose but the knowledge of the final purpose

scopus of nature but this requires a reference

of such knowledge to something supersensible far

transcending all our teleological knowledge of nature

for the purpose of the existence of109 nature must

itself be sought beyond nature the internal form

of a mere blade of grass is sufficient to show that

for our human faculty of judgement its origin is284

possible only according to the rule of purposes

but if we change our point of view and look to the

use which other natural beings make of it abandon

the consideration of its internal organisation and

only look to its externally purposive references we

shall arrive at no categorical purpose all this purposive

reference rests on an ever more distant condition

which as unconditioned the presence of a

thing as final purpose lies quite outside the physicoteleological

view of the world for example grass

is needful for the ox which again is needful for man

as a means of existence but then we do not see why

it is necessary that men should exist a question

this which we shall not find so easy to answer if we

sometimes cast our thoughts on the new hollanders

or the inhabitants of tierra del fuego so conceived

the thing is not even a natural purpose for

neither it nor its whole genus is to be regarded as

a natural product
hence it is only so far as matter is organised

that it necessarily carries with it the concept of a

natural purpose because this its specific form is at

the same time a product of nature but this concept

leads necessarily to the idea of collective

nature as a system in accordance with the rule of

purposes to which idea all the mechanism of nature

must be subordinated according to principles of

reason at least in order to investigate natural

phenomena therein the principle of reason belongs

to it only as a subjective principle or a maxim

viz everything in the world is some way good for

something nothing is vain in it by the example

that nature gives us in its organic products we are

justified nay called upon to expect of it and of its

laws nothing that is not purposive on the whole
285

it is plain that this is not a principle for the

determinant but only for the reflective judgement

that it is regulative and not constitutive and that

we derive from it a clue by which we consider

natural things in reference to an already given ground

of determination according to a new lawabiding

order and extend our natural science according to

a different principle viz that of final causes but yet

without prejudice to the principle of mechanical

causality furthermore it is in no wise thus

decided whether anything of which we judge by this

principle is a designed purpose of nature whether

the grass is for the ox or the sheep or whether

these and the other things of nature are here for

men it is well also from this side to consider the

things which are unpleasant to us and are contrary

to purpose in particular references thus for

example we can say the vermin that torment men

in their clothes their hair or their beds may be

according to a wise appointment of nature a motive

to cleanliness which is in itself an important means

for the preservation of health or again the mosquitoes

and other stinging insects that make the

wildernesses of america so oppressive to the savages

may be so many goads to activity for these primitive

men inducing them to drain the marshes and

bring light into the forests which intercept every

breath of air and in this way as well as by cultivating

the soil to make their habitations more healthy

the same thing which appears to men contradictory

to nature in its inner organisation if viewed in this

light gives an entertaining sometimes an instructive

outlook into a teleological order of things to which

without such a principle mere physical observation

would not lead us by itself thus some persons286

regard the tapeworm as given to the men or

animals in whom it resides as a kind of setoff for

some defect in their vital organs now i would ask

if dreams without which we never sleep though we

seldom remember them may not be a purposive

ordinance of nature for during the relaxation of

all the moving powers of the body they serve

to excite internally the vital organs by the medium

of the imagination and its great activity which in

this state generally rises to the height of affection

during sleep the imagination commonly is more

actively at play when the stomach is overloaded in

which case this excitement is the more necessary

consequently then without this internal power of

motion and this fatiguing unrest on account of which

we complain about our dreams though in fact they

are rather remedial sleep even in a sound state of

health would be a complete extinction of life
also the beauty of nature ie its connexion

with the free play of our cognitive faculties in

apprehending and judging of its appearance can be

regarded as a kind of objective purposiveness of

nature in its whole content as a system of which

man is a member if once the teleological judging

of the same by means of the natural purposes which

organised beings suggest to us has justified for

us the idea of a great system of purposes of nature

we can regard it as a favour110 which nature has felt287

for us that in addition to what is useful it has so

profusely dispensed beauty and charm and we can

therefore love it as well as regard it with respect on

account of its immensity and feel ourselves ennobled

by such regard just as if nature had established

and adorned its splendid theatre precisely with this

view
we shall say only one thing more in this paragraph

if we have once discovered in nature a

faculty of bringing forth products that can only be

thought by us in accordance with the concept of

final causes we go further still we venture to

judge that things belong to a system of purposes

which yet do not either in themselves or in their

purposive relations necessitate our seeking for any

principle of their possibility beyond the mechanism

of causes working blindly for the first idea as

concerns its ground already brings us beyond the

world of sense since the unity of the supersensible

principle must be regarded as valid in this way not

merely for certain species of natural beings but for

the whole of nature as a system
 68 of the principle of teleology as internal

principle of natural science
the principles of a science are either internal to

it and are then called domestic principia domestica

or are based on concepts that can only find their

place outside it and so are foreign principles peregrina

sciences that contain the latter place at

the basis of their doctrines auxiliary propositions

lemmata ie they borrow some concept and with

it a ground of arrangement from another science
every science is in itself a system and it is not288

enough in it to build in accordance with principles

and thus to employ a technical procedure but we

must go to work with it architectonically as a

building subsisting for itself we must not treat it as

an additional wing or part of another building but

as a whole in itself although we may subsequently

make a passage from it into that other or conversely
if then we introduce into the context of natural

science the concept of god in order to explain the

purposiveness in nature and subsequently use this

purposiveness to prove that there is a god there is

no internal consistency in either science ie either

in natural science or theology and a delusive

circle brings them both into uncertainty because

they have allowed their boundaries to overlap
the expression a purpose of nature already

sufficiently prevents the confusion of mixing up

natural science and the occasion that it gives for

judging teleologically of its objects with the consideration

of god and so of a theological derivation

of them we must not regard it as insignificant

if one interchanges this expression with that of a

divine purpose in the ordering of nature or gives

out the latter as more suitable and proper for a

pious soul because it must come in the end to

deriving these purposive forms in nature from a

wise author of the world on the contrary we

must carefully and modestly limit ourselves to the

expression a purpose of nature which asserts exactly

as much as we know before we ask after the cause

of nature itself we find in nature and in the course

of its development products of the same kind which

are developed in it according to known empirical

laws in accordance with which natural science must

judge of its objects and consequently must seek289

in nature their causality according to the rule of

purposes so then it must not transgress its bounds

in order to introduce into itself as a domestic principle

that to whose concept no experience can be commensurate

upon which we are only entitled to

venture after the completion of natural science
natural characteristics which demonstrate themselves

a priori and consequently admit of insight

into their possibility from universal principles without

any admixture of experience although they

carry with them a technical purposiveness yet cannot

because they are absolutely necessary be referred

to the teleology of nature as to a method belonging

to physic for solving its problems arithmetical

or geometrical analogies as well as universal

mechanical lawshowever strange and admirable

may seem to us the union of different rules quite

independent of one another according to all appearance

in a single principlepossess on that account

no claim to be teleological grounds of explanation

in physic even if they deserve to be brought into

consideration in the universal theory of the purposiveness

of things of nature yet they belong to another

science ie metaphysic and constitute no internal

principle of natural science as with the empirical

laws of natural purposes in organised beings it is not

only permissible but unavoidable to use the teleological

mode of judging as a principle of the doctrine

of nature in regard to a particular class of its objects
so to the end that physic may keep within its

own bounds it abstracts itself entirely from the

question whether natural purposes are designed or

undesigned for that would be to meddle in an

extraneous business in metaphysic it is enough

that there are objects alone explicable according290

to natural laws which we can only think by means

of the idea of purposes as principle and also alone

internally cognisable as concerns their internal form

in this way in order therefore to remove the

suspicion of the slightest assumptionas if we

wished to mix with our grounds of cognition

something not belonging to physic at all viz a

supernatural causewe speak in teleology indeed

of nature as if the purposiveness therein were designed

but in such a way that this design is ascribed

to nature ie to matter now in this way there can

be no misunderstanding because no design in the

proper meaning of the word can possibly be ascribed

to inanimate matter we thus give notice that this

word here only expresses a principle of the reflective

not of the determinant judgement and so is to

introduce no particular ground of causality but

only adds for the use of the reason a different

kind of investigation from that according to

mechanical laws in order to supplement the inadequacy

of the latter even for empirical research

into all particular laws of nature hence we speak

quite correctly in teleology so far as it is referred

to physic of the wisdom the economy the forethought

the beneficence of nature without either

making an intelligent being of it for that would be

preposterous or even without presuming to place

another intelligent being above it as its architect

for that would be presumptuous111 but there should291

be only signified thereby a kind of causality of

nature after the analogy of our own in the technical

use of reason in order to have before us the rule

according to which certain products of nature must

be investigated
but now why is it that teleology usually forms

no proper part of theoretical natural science but

is regarded as a propaedeutic or transition to

theology this is done in order to restrict the

study of nature mechanically considered to that

which we can so subject to observation or experiment

that we are able to produce it ourselves as

nature does or at least by similar laws for we

see into a thing completely only so far as we can

make it in accordance with our concepts and bring

it to completion but organisation as an inner

purpose of nature infinitely surpasses all our faculty

of presenting the like by means of art and as

concerns the external contrivances of nature regarded

as purposive wind rain etc physic indeed considers

their mechanism but it cannot at all present

their reference to purposes so far as this is a condition

necessarily belonging to cause for this necessity

of connexion has to do altogether with the combination

of our concepts and not with the constitution

of things

292

second division
dialectic of the teleological judgement
 69 what is an antinomy of the judgement
the determinant judgement has for itself no

principles which are the foundation of concepts of

objects it has no autonomy for it subsumes only

under given laws or concepts as principles hence

it is exposed to no danger of an antinomy of its own

or to a conflict of its principles so we saw that

the transcendental judgement which contains the

conditions of subsuming under categories was for

itself not nomothetic but that it only indicated the

conditions of sensuous intuition under which reality

application can be supplied to a given concept as

law of the understanding whereby the judgement

could never fall into discord with itself at least as

far as its principles are concerned
but the reflective judgement must subsume under

a law which is not yet given and is therefore in fact

only a principle of reflection upon objects for which

we are objectively quite in want of a law or of a

concept of an object that would be adequate as a

principle for the cases that occur since now no use

of the cognitive faculties can be permitted without

principles the reflective judgement must in such

cases serve as a principle for itself this because293

it is not objective and can supply no ground of

cognition of the object adequate for design must

serve as a mere subjective principle for the purposive

employment of our cognitive faculties ie

for reflecting upon a class of objects therefore in

reference to such cases the reflective judgement has

its maximsnecessary maximson behalf of the

cognition of natural laws in experience in order to

attain by their means to concepts even concepts

of reason since it has absolute need of such in

order to learn merely to cognise nature according to

its empirical lawsbetween these necessary

maxims of the reflective judgement there may be a

conflict and consequently an antinomy upon which

a dialectic bases itself if each of two conflicting

maxims has its ground in the nature of the cognitive

faculties this may be called a natural dialectic and

an unavoidable illusion which we must expose and

resolve in our critique to the end that it may not

deceive us
 70 representation of this antinomy
so far as reason has to do with nature as the

complex of objects of external sense it can base itself

partly upon laws which the understanding itself

prescribes a priori to nature partly upon laws which

it can extend indefinitely by means of the empirical

determinations occurring in experience to apply

the former kind of laws ie the universal laws of

material nature in general the judgement needs no

special principle of reflection since it is there

determinant because an objective principle is given

to it through understanding but as regards the

particular laws that can only be made known to us294

through experience there can be under them such

great manifoldness and diversity that the judgement

must serve as its own principle in order to investigate

and search into the phenomena of nature

in accordance with a law such a guiding thread is

needed if we are only to hope for a connected

empirical cognition according to a thoroughgoing

conformity of nature to law even its unity according

to empirical laws in this contingent unity of

particular laws it may very well happen that the

judgement in its reflection proceeds from two maxims

one of these is suggested to it a priori by the mere

understanding but the other is prompted by particular

experiences which bring the reason into

play in order to form a judgement upon corporeal

nature and its laws in accordance with a particular

principle hence it comes about that these two

kinds of maxims seem to be incapable of existing

together and consequently a dialectic arises which

leads the judgement into error in the principle of its

reflection
the first maxim of judgement is the proposition

all production of material things and their forms

must be judged to be possible according to merely

mechanical laws
the second maxim is the counterproposition

some products of material nature cannot be judged

to be possible according to merely mechanical laws

to judge them requires quite a different law of

causality namely that of final causes
if these regulative principles of investigation be

converted into constitutive principles of the possibility

of objects they will run thus
proposition all production of material things is

possible according to merely mechanical laws
295
counterproposition some production of material

things is not possible according to merely mechanical

laws
in this latter aspect as objective principles for

the determinant judgement they would contradict

each other and consequently one of the two propositions

must necessarily be false we shall then

it is true have an antinomy but not of judgement

there will be a conflict in the legislation of reason

reason however can prove neither the one nor the

other of these fundamental propositions because we

can have a priori no determinant principle of the

possibility of things according to mere empirical

laws of nature
on the other hand as regards the firstmentioned

maxims of a reflective judgement they involve no

contradiction in fact for if i say i must judge

according to merely mechanical laws of the possibility

of all events in material nature and consequently

of all forms regarded as its products i do

not therefore say they are possible in this way alone

apart from any other kind of causality all that is

implied is i must always reflect upon them according

to the principle of the mere mechanism of nature and

consequently investigate this as far as i can because

unless this lies at the basis of investigation there can

be no proper knowledge of nature at all but this

does not prevent us if occasion offers from following

out the second maxim in the case of certain natural

forms and even by occasion of these in the whole

of nature in order to reflect upon them according

to the principle of final causes which is quite a

different thing from explaining them according to

the mechanism of nature reflection in accordance

with the first maxim is thus not abrogated on the296

contrary we are told to follow it as far as we can

nor is it said that these forms would not be possible

in accordance with the mechanism of nature it is

only asserted that human reason in following up this

maxim and in this way could never find the least

ground for that which constitutes the specific

character of a natural purpose although it would

increase its knowledge of natural laws thus it is

left undecided whether or not in the unknown inner

ground of nature physicomechanical and purposive

combination may be united in the same things in one

principle we only say that our reason is not in a

position so to unite them and that therefore the

judgement as reflectivefrom subjective grounds

not as determinant in consequence of an objective

principle of the possibility of things in themselves

is compelled to think a different principle from that

of natural mechanism as the ground of the possibility

of certain forms in nature
 71 preliminary to the solution of the above

antinomy
we can in no way prove the impossibility of the

production of organised natural products by the mere

mechanism of nature because we cannot see into

the first inner ground of the infinite multiplicity of

the particular laws of nature which are contingent

for us since they are only empirically known and so

we cannot arrive at the inner allsufficient principle

of the possibility of a nature a principle which lies

in the supersensible whether therefore the productive

faculty of nature is sufficient for that which

we judge to be formed or combined in accordance

with the idea of purposes as well as for that which297

we believe to require merely a mechanical system

maschinenwesen of nature or whether there lies

at the basis of things which we must necessarily

judge as properly natural purposes a quite different

kind of original causality which cannot be contained

in material nature or in its intelligible substrate viz

an architectonic understandingthis is a question

to which our reason very narrowly limited in respect

of the concept of causality if it is to be specified a

priori can give no answer whateverbut it is just

as certain and beyond doubt that in regard to our

cognitive faculties the mere mechanism of nature

can furnish no ground of explanation of the production

of organised beings for the reflective judgement

it is therefore a quite correct fundamental

proposition that for that connexion of things according

to final causes which is so plain there must be

thought a causality distinct from that of mechanism

viz that of an intelligent cause of the world acting

in accordance with purposes but for the determinant

judgement this would be a hasty and unprovable

proposition in the first case it is a mere maxim of

the judgement wherein the concept of that causality

is a mere idea to which we by no means undertake

to concede reality but which we use as a guide to

reflection which remains thereby always open to all

mechanical grounds of explanation and does not

withdraw out of the world of sense in the second

case the proposition would be an objective principle

prescribed by reason to which the determinant

judgement must subject itself whereby however it

withdraws beyond the world of sense into the transcendent

and perhaps is led into error
all appearance of an antinomy between the

maxims of the proper physical mechanical and the298

teleological technical methods of explanation rests

therefore on this that we confuse a fundamental

proposition of the reflective with one of the determinant

judgement and the autonomy of the first

which has mere subjective validity for our use of

reason in respect of particular empirical laws with

the heteronomy of the second which must regulate

itself according to laws universal or particular

given to it by the understanding
 72 of the different systems which deal with the

purposiveness of nature
no one has ever doubted the correctness of the

proposition that judgement must be passed upon

certain things of nature organised beings and their

possibility in accordance with the concept of final

causes even if we only desire a guiding thread to

learn how to cognise their constitution through

observation without aspiring to an investigation into

their first origin the question therefore can only

be whether this fundamental proposition is merely

subjectively valid ie is a mere maxim of our

judgement or whether it is an objective principle

of nature in accordance with which apart from its

mechanism according to the mere laws of motion

quite a different kind of causality attaches to it viz

that of final causes under which these laws of

moving forces stand only as intermediate causes
we could leave this question or problem quite

undecided and unsolved speculatively because if we

content ourselves with speculation within the bounds

of mere natural knowledge we have enough in these

maxims for the study of nature and for the tracking

out of its hidden secrets as far as human powers299

reach there is then indeed a certain presentiment

of our reason or a hint as it were given us by

nature that by means of this concept of final causes

we go beyond nature and could unite it to the

highest point in the series of causes if we were to

abandon or at least to lay aside for a time the

investigation of nature although we may not have

advanced far in it and seek thenceforth to find out

whither this stranger in natural science viz the

concept of natural purposes would lead us
but here these undisputed maxims pass over

into problems opening out a wide field for difficulties

does purposive connexion in nature prove a particular

kind of causality or is it not rather

considered in itself and in accordance with objective

principles similar to the mechanism of nature resting

on one and the same ground only as this

ground in many natural products is often hidden

too deep for our investigation we make trial of

a subjective principle that of art ie of causality

according to ideas and we ascribe it to nature by

analogy this expedient succeeds in many cases

but seems in some to mislead and in no case does

it justify us in introducing into natural science a

particular kind of operation quite distinct from the

causality according to the mere mechanical laws of

nature we give the name of technic to the procedure

the causality of nature on account of the

appearance of purpose that we find in its products

and we shall divide this into designed technica

intentionalis and undesigned technica naturalis

the first is meant to signify that the productive

faculty of nature according to final causes must be

taken for a particular kind of causality the second

that it is at bottom quite similar to the mechanism of300

nature and that its contingent agreement with our

artistic concepts and their rules should be explained

as a mere subjective condition of judging it and not

falsely as a particular kind of natural production
if we now speak of systems explanatory of

nature in regard of final causes it must be remarked

that they all controvert each other dogmatically

ie as to objective principles of the possibility of

things whether there are causes which act designedly

or whether they are quite without design they

do not dispute as to the subjective maxims by

which we merely judge of the causes of such

purposive products in this latter case disparate

principles could very well be unified but in the

former contradictorily opposed laws annul each other

and cannot subsist together
there are two sorts of systems as to the technic

of nature ie its productive power in accordance

with the rule of purposes viz idealism or realism

of natural purposes the first maintains that all

purposiveness of nature is undesigned the second

that some in organised beings is designed from

this latter the hypothetical consequence can be

deduced that the technic of nature as concerns

all its other products in reference to the whole of

nature is also designed ie is a purpose
1 the idealism of purposiveness i always understand

here by this objective purposiveness is either

that of the casuality or the fatality of the determination

of nature in the purposive form of its products

the former principle treats of the reference of matter

to the physical basis of its form viz the laws of

motion the second its reference to the hyperphysical

basis of itself and of the whole of nature the

system of casuality that is ascribed to epicurus or301
democritus is taken literally so plainly absurd that

it need not detain us opposed to this is the

system of fatality of which spinoza is taken as the

author although it is much older according to

all appearance this as it appeals to something

supersensible to which our insight does not extend

is not so easy to controvert but that is because its

concept of the original being is not possible to

understand but so much is clear that on this

theory the purposive combination in the world must

be taken as undesigned for although derived from

an original being it is not derived from its understanding

or from any design on its part but rather

from the necessity of its nature and of the worldunity

which emanates therefrom consequently the

fatalism of purposiveness is at the same time an

idealism
2 the realism of the purposiveness of

nature is also either physical or hyperphysical

the former bases the purposes in nature by the

analogy of a faculty acting with design on the life

of matter either its own or the life of an inner

principle in it a worldsoul and is called hylozoism

the latter derives them from the original ground

of the universe as from an intelligent being

originally living who produces them with design

and is theism112
302
 73 none of the above systems give what they

pretend
what do all these systems desire they desire

to explain our teleological judgements about nature

and they go so to work therewith that some deny

their truth and consequently explain them as an

idealism of nature represented as art others

recognise them as true and promise to establish

the possibility of a nature in accordance with the

idea of final causes
1 the systems which defend the idealism of

final causes in nature grant it is true on the one

hand to their principle a causality in accordance with

the laws of motion through which causality natural

things exist purposively but they deny to it intentionality

ie that it designedly determines itself to

this its purposive production in other words they

deny that the cause is a purpose this is epicuruss

method of explanation according to which the distinction

between a technic of nature and mere

mechanism is altogether denied blind chance is

taken as the explanatory ground not only of the

agreement of the developed products with our concepts

of the purpose and consequently of natures

technic but also of the determination of the causes

of this production in accordance with the laws of

motion and consequently of their mechanism

thus nothing is explained not even the illusion in

our teleological judgements and consequently the

wouldbe idealism of these in no way established
on the other hand spinoza wishes to dispense

with all inquiries into the ground of the possibility

of purposes of nature and to take away all reality303

from this idea he allows their validity in general

not as products but as accidents inhering in an

original being and to this being as substrate of

those natural things he ascribes not causality in

regard to them but mere subsistence on account

of its unconditioned necessity and also that of all

natural things as accidents inhering in it he secures

it is true to the forms of nature that unity of ground

which is requisite for all purposiveness but at the

same time he tears away their contingence without

which no unity of purpose can be thought and

with it all design inasmuch as he takes away all

intelligence from the original ground of natural

things
but spinozism does not furnish what it desires

it desires to afford an explanatory ground of the

purposive connexion which it does not deny of

the things of nature and it merely speaks of the

unity of the subject in which they all inhere but

even if we concede to it that the beings of the

world exist in this way such ontological unity is not

therefore a unity of purpose and does not make this

in any way comprehensible for this latter is a

quite particular kind of unity which does not follow

from the connexion of things the beings of the

world in a subject the original being but implies in

itself reference to a cause which has understanding

and even if we unite all these things in a simple

subject this never exhibits a purposive reference

for we do not think of them first as the inner

effects of the substance as if it were a cause nor

secondly of this cause as a cause producing effects

by means of its understanding without these

formal conditions all unity is mere natural necessity

and if it is ascribed as well to things which we304

represent as external to one another blind necessity

but if we wish to give the name of purposiveness of

nature to that which the schoolmen call the transcendental

perfection of things in reference to their

proper being according to which everything has in

itself that which is requisite to make it one thing

and not another then we are only like children

playing with words instead of concepts for if all

things must be thought as purposes then to be a

thing is the same as to be a purpose and there is

at bottom nothing which specially deserves to be

represented as a purpose
we hence see at once that spinoza by his reducing

our concepts of the purposive in nature to our

own consciousness of existing in an allembracing

though simple being and by his seeking that form

merely in the unity of this being must have intended

to maintain not the realism but the idealism of its

purposiveness even this he was not able to accomplish

because the mere representation of the unity

of the substrate cannot bring about the idea of a

purposiveness even that which is only undesigned
2 those who not only maintain the realism

of natural purposes but also set about explaining

it believe that they can comprehend at least as

regards its possibility a practical kind of causality

viz that of causes working designedly otherwise

they could not undertake to supply this explanation

for to authorise even the most daring of hypotheses

at least the possibility of what we assume as basis

must be certain and we must be able to assure

objective reality to its concept
but the possibility of living matter cannot even

be thought its concept involves a contradiction

because lifelessness inertia constitutes the essential305

character of matter the possibility of matter

endowed with life and of collective nature regarded

as an animal can only be used in an inadequate

way in the interests of the hypothesis of purposiveness

in the whole of nature so far as it is manifested

by experience in the organisation of nature

on a small scale but in no way can we have insight

into its possibility a priori there must then be a

circle in the explanation if we wish to derive the

purposiveness of nature in organised beings from

the life of matter and yet only know this life in

organised beings and can form no concept of

its possibility without experience of this kind

hylozoism therefore does not furnish what it

promises
finally theism can just as little establish

dogmatically the possibility of natural purposes as a

key to teleology although it certainly is superior to

all other grounds of explanation in that through the

understanding which it ascribes to the original

being it rescues in the best way the purposiveness

of nature from idealism and introduces a causality

acting with design for its production
but we must first prove satisfactorily to the

determinant judgement the impossibility of the

unity of purpose in matter resulting from its mere

mechanism before we are justified in placing the

ground of this beyond nature in a determinate way

we can however advance no further than this

in accordance with the constitution and limits of

our cognitive faculties whilst we do not comprehend

even the first inner ground of this mechanism we

must in no wise seek in matter a principle of

determinate purposive references but no other

way of judging of the origination of its products306

as natural purposes remains to us than that by

means of a supreme understanding as cause of

the world but this is only a ground for the

reflective not for the determinant judgement and

can justify absolutely no objective assertion

 74 the reason that we cannot treat the concept of

a technic of nature dogmatically is the fact that

a natural purpose is inexplicable
we deal with a concept dogmatically even

though it should be empirically conditioned if we

consider it as contained under another concept of

the object which constitutes a principle113 of reason

and determine it in conformity with this but we

deal with it merely critically if we consider it only

in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently

to the subjective conditions of thinking it

without undertaking to decide anything about its

object dogmatic procedure with a concept is

then that which is conformable to law for the

determinant judgement critical procedure for the

reflective judgement
now the concept of a thing as a natural purpose

is a concept which subsumes nature under a

causality only thinkable through reason in order to

judge in accordance with this principle about that

which is given of the object in experience but in

order to use it dogmatically for the determinant

judgement we must be assured first of the objective

reality of this concept because otherwise we could

subsume no natural thing under it again the307

concept of a thing as a natural purpose is no doubt

empirically conditioned ie only possible under

certain conditions given in experience though not

to be abstracted therefrom but it is a concept only

possible in accordance with a rational principle in

the judgement about the object its objective

reality therefore ie that an object in conformity

with it is possible cannot be comprehended and

dogmatically established as such a principle and we

do not know whether it is merely a sophistical and

objectively empty concept conceptus ratiocinans

or a rational concept establishing a cognition

and confirmed by reason conceptus ratiocinatus114

therefore it cannot be dogmatically treated for the

determinant judgement ie it is not only impossible

to decide whether or not things of nature considered

as natural purposes require for their production a

causality of a quite peculiar kind that acting on

design but the question cannot even be put

because the concept of a natural purpose is simply

not susceptible of proof through reason as regards

its objective reality that is it is not constitutive

for the determinant judgement but merely regulative

for the reflective
that it is not susceptible of proof is clear because

as concept of a natural product it embraces in

itself natural necessity and at the same time as

purpose a contingency of the form of the object

in reference to the mere laws of nature in the

very same thing hence if there is to be no

contradiction here it must contain a ground for the

possibility of the thing in nature and also a ground

of the possibility of this nature itself and of its308

reference to something which not being empirically

cognisable nature supersensible is therefore for

us not cognisable at all this is requisite if it

is to be judged according to a different kind of

causality from that of natural mechanism when we

wish to establish its possibility the concept of a

thing then as a natural purpose is transcendent

for the determinant judgement if we consider the

object through reason although for the reflective

judgement it certainly may be immanent in respect

of the objects of experience hence for determinant

judgements objective reality cannot be supplied

to it and so it is intelligible how all systems that

one may project for the dogmatic treatment of the

concept of natural purposes and of nature itself

considered as a whole connected together by

means of final causes can decide nothing either by

objective affirmation or by objective denial for if

things be subsumed under a concept that is merely

problematical its synthetical predicates eg in the

question whether the purpose of nature which we

conceive for the production of things is designed or

undesigned can furnish only problematical judgements

of the object whether affirmative or negative

and we do not know whether we are judging about

something or about nothing the concept of a

causality through purposes of art has at all events

objective reality and also the concept of a causality

according to the mechanism of nature but the

concept of a causality of nature according to the

rule of purposesstill more of a being such as

cannot be given us in experience a being who is

the original cause of naturethough it can be

thought without contradiction yet is of no avail for

dogmatic determinations for since it cannot be309

derived from experience and also is not requisite

for the possibility thereof its objective reality can

in no way be assured but even if this could be

done how can i number among the products of

nature things which are definitely accounted products

of divine art when it is just the incapacity of nature

to produce such things according to its own laws

that made it necessary to invoke a cause different

from it

 75 the concept of an objective purposiveness of

nature is a critical principle of reason for

the reflective judgement
it is then one thing to say the production of

certain things of nature or that of collective nature

is only possible through a cause which determines

itself to action according to design and quite

another to say i can according to the peculiar

constitution of my cognitive faculties judge concerning

the possibility of these things and their production

in no other fashion than by conceiving for this

a cause working according to design ie a being

which is productive in a way analogous to the

causality of an intelligence in the former case i

wish to establish something concerning the object

and am bound to establish the objective reality of

an assumed concept in the latter reason only

determines the use of my cognitive faculties conformably

to their peculiarities and to the essential

conditions of their range and their limits thus

the former principle is an objective proposition for

the determinant judgement the latter merely a

subjective proposition for the reflective judgement

ie a maxim which reason prescribes to it
310

we are in fact indispensably obliged to ascribe

the concept of design to nature if we wish to

investigate it though only in its organised products

by continuous observation and this concept is

therefore an absolutely necessary maxim for the

empirical use of our reason it is plain that once

such a guiding thread for the study of nature is

admitted and verified we must at least try the said

maxim of judgement in nature as a whole because

thereby many of natures laws might discover

themselves which otherwise on account of the

limitation of our insight into its inner mechanism

would remain hidden but though in regard to

this latter employment that maxim of judgement is

certainly useful it is not indispensable for nature

as a whole is not given as organised in the narrow

sense of the word above indicated on the other

hand in regard to those natural products which

must be judged of as designed and not formed

otherwise if we are to have empirical knowledge of

their inner constitution this maxim of the reflective

judgement is essentially necessary because the very

thought of them as organised beings is impossible

without combining therewith the thought of their

designed production
now the concept of a thing whose existence or

form we represent to ourselves as possible under

the condition of a purpose is inseparably bound up

with the concept of its contingency according to

natural laws hence the natural things that we

find possible only as purposes supply the best proof

of the contingency of the worldwhole to the

common understanding and to the philosopher

alike they are the only valid ground of proof for its

dependence on and origin from a being existing outside311

the worlda being who must also be intelligent

on account of that purposive form teleology then

finds the consummation of its investigations only in

theology
but what now in the end does the most complete

teleology prove does it prove that there is such

an intelligent being no it only proves that

according to the constitution of our cognitive faculties

and in the consequent combination of experience

with the highest principles of reason we can form

absolutely no concept of the possibility of such a

world as this save by thinking a designedlyworking

supreme cause thereof objectively we cannot therefore

lay down the proposition there is an intelligent

original being but only subjectively for the use of

our judgement in its reflection upon the purposes in

nature which can be thought according to no other

principle than that of a designing causality of a

highest cause
if we wished to establish on teleological grounds

the above proposition dogmatically we should be

beset with difficulties from which we could not

extricate ourselves for then the proposition must

at bottom be reduced to the conclusion that the

organised beings in the world are no otherwise

possible than by a designedlyworking cause and

we should unavoidably have to assert that because

we can follow up these things in their causal combination

only under the idea of purposes and cognise

them only according to their conformity to law we

are thereby justified in assuming this as a condition

necessary for every thinking and cognising beinga

condition consequently attaching to the object and

not merely to our subject but such an assertion

we do not succeed in sustaining for since we312

do not properly speaking observe the purposes in

nature as designed but only in our reflection upon

its products think this concept as a guiding thread

for our judgement they are not given to us through

the object it is quite impossible for us a priori to

vindicate as capable of assumption such a concept

according to its objective reality it remains therefore

a proposition absolutely resting upon subjective

conditions alone viz of the judgement reflecting in

conformity with our cognitive faculties if we expressed

this proposition dogmatically as objectively

valid it would be there is a god but for us

men there is only permissible the limited formula

we cannot otherwise think and make comprehensible

the purposiveness which must lie at the

bottom of our cognition of the internal possibility

of many natural things than by representing it and

the world in general as a product of an intelligent

cause a god115
now if this proposition based on an inevitably

necessary maxim of our judgement is completely

satisfactory from every human point of view for both

the speculative and practical use of our reason i

should like to know what we lose by not being able

to prove it as also valid for higher beings from

objective grounds which unfortunately are beyond

our faculties it is indeed quite certain that we

cannot adequately cognise much less explain organised

beings and their internal possibility according

to mere mechanical principles of nature and we can

say boldly it is alike certain that it is absurd for men

to make any such attempt or to hope that another

newton will arise in the future who shall make

comprehensible by us the production of a blade of313

grass according to natural laws which no design has

ordered116 we must absolutely deny this insight to

men but then how do we know that in nature if

we could penetrate to the principle by which it

specifies the universal laws known to us there

cannot lie hidden in its mere mechanism a sufficient

ground of the possibility of organised beings without

supposing any design in their production would

it not be judged by us presumptuous to say this

probabilities here are of no account when we have

to do with judgements of pure reasonwe cannot

therefore judge objectively either affirmatively or

negatively concerning the proposition does a

being acting according to design lie at the basis of

what we rightly call natural purposes as the cause

of the world and consequently as its author so

much only is sure that if we are to judge according

to what is permitted us to see by our own proper

nature the conditions and limitations of our reason

we can place at the basis of the possibility of these

natural purposes nothing else than an intelligent

being this alone is in conformity with the maxim

of our reflective judgement and therefore with a

ground which though subjective is inseparably

attached to the human race
 76 remark
this consideration which very well deserves to314

be worked out in detail in transcendental philosophy

can come in here only in passing by way of elucidation

not as a proof of what is here proposed
reason is a faculty of principles and proceeds in

its extremest advance to the unconditioned on the

other hand the understanding stands at its service

always only under a certain condition which must be

given but without concepts of understanding to

which objective reality must be given the reason

cannot form any objective synthetical judgement

and contains in itself as theoretical reason

absolutely no constitutive but merely regulative

principles we soon see that where the understanding

cannot follow the reason is transcendent

and shows itself in ideas formerly established as

regulative principles but not in objectively valid

concepts but the understanding which cannot

keep pace with reason but yet is requisite for the

validity of objects limits the validity of these ideas

to the subject although extending it generally to all

subjects of this kind that is the understanding

limits their validity to the condition that according

to the nature of our human cognitive faculties or

generally according to the concept which we ourselves

can make of the faculty of a finite intelligent

being nothing else can or must be thought though

this is not to assert that the ground of such a judgement

lies in the object we shall adduce some

examples which though they are too important and

difficult to impose them on the reader as proved

propositions yet will give him material for thought

and may serve to elucidate what we are here

specially concerned with
it is indispensably necessary for the human

understanding to distinguish between the possibility315

and the actuality of things the ground for this

lies in the subject and in the nature of our cognitive

faculties such a distinction between the possible

and the actual would not be given were there not

requisite for knowledge two quite different elements

understanding for concepts and sensible intuition

for objects corresponding to them if our understanding

were intuitive it would have no objects but

those which are actual concepts which merely extend

to the possibility of an object and sensible intuitions

which give us something without allowing us

to cognise it thus as an object would both disappear

but now the whole of our distinction between the

merely possible and the actual rests on this that the

former only signifies the positing of the representation

of a thing in respect of our concept and in

general in respect of the faculty of thought while

the latter signifies the positing of the thing in itself

outside this concept117 the distinction then of

possible things from actual is one which has merely

subjective validity for the human understanding

because we can always have a thing in our thoughts

although it is really nothing or we can represent a

thing as given although we have no concept of it

the propositions thereforethat things can be

possible without being actual and that consequently

no conclusion can be drawn as to actuality from

mere possibilityare quite valid for human reason

without thereby proving that this distinction lies

in things themselves that this does not follow

and that consequently these propositions though

valid of objects in so far as our cognitive faculty as

sensuously conditioned busies itself with objects of

sense do not hold for things in general appears316

from the irrepressible demand of reason to assume

something the original ground necessarily existing

as unconditioned in which possibility and actuality

should no longer be distinguished and for which

idea our understanding has absolutely no concept

ie it can find no way of representing such a thing

and its manner of existence for if the understanding

thinks such a thing which it may do at pleasure

the thing is merely represented as possible if it is

conscious of it as given in intuition then is it actual

but nothing as to its possibility is thus thought

hence the concept of an absolutely necessary being

is no doubt an indispensable idea of reason but yet

it is a problematical concept unattainable by the

human understanding it is indeed valid for the

employment of our cognitive faculties in accordance

with their peculiar constitution but not valid of the

object nor is it valid for every knowing being

because i cannot presuppose in every such being

thought and intuition as two distinct conditions of

the exercise of its cognitive faculties and consequently

as conditions of the possibility and actuality

of things an understanding into which this distinction

did not enter might say all objects that

i know are ie exist and the possibility of some

which yet do not exist ie the contingency or the

contrasted necessity of those which do exist might

never come into the representation of such a being

at all but what makes it difficult for our understanding

to treat its concepts here as reason does

is merely that for it as human understanding that

is transcendent ie impossible for the subjective

conditions of its cognition which reason makes

into a principle appertaining to the objecthere

the maxim always holds that all objects whose317

cognition surpasses the faculty of the understanding

are thought by us according to the subjective conditions

of the exercise of that faculty which necessarily

attach to our human nature if judgements laid

down in this way and there is no other alternative

in regard to transcendent concepts cannot be constitutive

principles determining the object as it is

they will remain regulative principles adapted to the

human point of view immanent in their exercise

and sure
just as reason in the theoretical consideration

of nature must assume the idea of an unconditioned

necessity of its original ground so also it presupposes

in the practical sphere its own in respect of nature

unconditioned causality or freedom in that it is conscious

of its own moral command here the objective

necessity of the act as a duty is opposed to that

necessity which it would have as an event if its

ground lay in nature and not in freedom ie in the

causality of reason the morally absolutely necessary

act is regarded as physically quite contingent

since that which ought necessarily to happen often

does not happen it is clear then that it is owing

to the subjective constitution of our practical faculty

that the moral laws must be represented as commands

and the actions conforming to them as duties and

that reason expresses this necessity not by an is

happens but by an ought to be this would

not be the case were reason considered as in its

causality independent of sensibility as the subjective

condition of its application to objects of nature and

so as cause in an intelligible world entirely in agreement

with the moral law for in such a world there

would be no distinction between ought to do and

does between a practical law of that which is318

possible through us and the theoretical law of that

which is actual through us though therefore an

intelligible world in which everything would be

actual merely because as something good it is

possible together with freedom as its formal condition

is for us a transcendent concept not available

as a constitutive principle to determine an object

and its objective reality yet because of the constitution

of our in part sensuous nature and faculty it

is so far as we can represent it in accordance with the

constitution of our reason for us and for all rational

beings that have a connexion with the world of

sense a universal regulative principle this principle

does not objectively determine the constitution of

freedom as a form of causality but it makes the

rule of actions according to that idea a command

for every one with no less validity than if it did

so determine it
in the same way we may concede thus much as

regards the case in hand between natural mechanism

and the technic of nature ie its purposive

connexion we should find no distinction were it not

that our understanding is of the kind that must

proceed from the universal to the particular the

judgement then in respect of the particular can cognise

no purposiveness and consequently can form no

determinant judgements without having a universal

law under which to subsume that particular now

the particular as such contains something contingent

in respect of the universal while yet reason requires

unity and conformity to law in the combination of

particular laws of nature this conformity of the

contingent to law is called purposiveness and the

derivation of particular laws from the universal as

regards their contingent element is impossible a319

priori through a determination of the concept of

the object hence the concept of the purposiveness

of nature in its products is necessary for human

judgement in respect of nature but has not to do

with the determination of objects it is therefore

a subjective principle of reason for the judgement

which as regulative not constitutive is just as

necessarily valid for our human judgement as if it

were an objective principle

 77 of the peculiarity of the human understanding

by means of which the concept of a natural

purpose is possible
we have brought forward in the remark

peculiarities of our cognitive faculties even the

higher ones which we are easily led to transfer as

objective predicates to the things themselves but

they concern ideas no object adequate to which

can be given in experience and they could only

serve as regulative principles in the pursuit of

experience this is the case with the concept

of a natural purpose which concerns the cause of

the possibility of such a predicate which cause can

only lie in the idea but the result corresponding

to it ie the product is given in nature and the

concept of a causality of nature as of a being acting

according to purposes seems to make the idea

of a natural purpose into a constitutive principle

which idea has thus something different from all

other ideas
this difference consists however in the fact

that the idea in question is not a rational principle

for the understanding but for the judgement it

is therefore merely the application of an understanding320

in general to possible objects of experience

in cases where the judgement can only be reflective

not determinant and where consequently the object

although given in experience cannot be determinately

judged in conformity with the idea not to say with

complete adequacy but can only be reflected on
there emerges therefore a peculiarity of our

human understanding in respect of the judgement

in its reflection upon things of nature but if this

be so the idea of a possible understanding different

from the human must be fundamental here just

so in the critique of pure reason we must have in

our thoughts another possible kind of intuition if

ours is to be regarded as a particular species for which

objects are only valid as phenomena and so we

are able to say certain natural products from the

special constitution of our understanding must be

considered by us in regard to their possibility as if

produced designedly and as purposes but we do

not therefore demand that there should be actually

given a particular cause which has the representation

of a purpose as its determining ground and

we do not deny that an understanding different

from ie higher than the human might find the

ground of the possibility of such products of nature

in the mechanism of nature ie in a causal combination

for which an understanding is not explicitly

assumed as cause
we have now to do with the relation of our

understanding to the judgement viz we seek for

a certain contingency in the constitution of our

understanding to which we may point as a peculiarity

distinguishing it from other possible understandings
this contingency is found naturally enough in321

the particular which the judgement is to bring

under the universal of the concepts of understanding

for the universal of our human understanding

does not determine the particular and it is contingent

in how many ways different things which agree in

a common characteristic may come before our

perception our understanding is a faculty of

concepts ie a discursive understanding for which

it obviously must be contingent of what kind and

how very different the particular may be that

can be given to it in nature and brought under its

concepts but now intuition also belongs to knowledge

and a faculty of a complete spontaneity of

intuition would be a cognitive faculty distinct from

sensibility and quite independent of it in other

words an understanding in the most general sense

thus we can think an intuitive understanding

negatively merely as not discursive118 which does

not proceed from the universal to the particular

and so to the individual through concepts for

it that contingency of the accordance of nature in

its products according to particular laws with the

understanding would not be met with and it is

this contingency that makes it so hard for our

understanding to reduce the manifold of nature

to the unity of knowledge this reduction our

understanding can only accomplish by bringing

natural characteristics into a very contingent

correspondence with our faculty of concepts of

which an intuitive understanding would have no

need
our understanding has then this peculiarity as

concerns the judgement that in cognition by it the

particular is not determined by the universal and322

cannot therefore be derived from it but at the same

time this particular in the manifold of nature must

accord with the universal by means of concepts and

laws so that it may be capable of being subsumed

under it this accordance under such circumstances

must be very contingent and without definite principle

as concerns the judgement
in order now to be able at least to think the possibility

of such an accordance of things of nature with

our judgement which accordance we represent as

contingent and consequently as only possible by means

of a purpose directed thereto we must at the same

time think of another understanding by reference to

which and apart from any purpose ascribed to it we

may represent as necessary that accordance of natural

laws with our judgement which for our understanding

is only thinkable through the medium of purposes
in fact our understanding has the property of

proceeding in its cognition eg of the cause of a

product from the analyticaluniversal concepts to

the particular the given empirical intuition thus

as regards the manifold of the latter it determines

nothing but must await this determination by

the judgement which subsumes the empirical

intuition if the object is a natural product under

the concept we can however think an understanding

which being not like ours discursive but

intuitive proceeds from the syntheticaluniversal

the intuition of a whole as such to the particular

ie from the whole to the parts the contingency of

the combination of the parts in order that a definite

form of the whole shall be possible is not implied

by such an understanding and its representation of

the whole our understanding requires this because

it must proceed from the parts as universally conceived323

grounds to different forms possible to be

subsumed under them as consequences according

to the constitution of our understanding a real

whole of nature is regarded only as the effect of the

concurrent motive powers of the parts suppose

then that we wish not to represent the possibility of

the whole as dependent on that of the parts after

the manner of our discursive understanding but

according to the standard of the intuitive original

understanding to represent the possibility of the

parts according to their constitution and combination

as dependent on that of the whole in accordance

with the above peculiarity of our understanding

it cannot happen that the whole shall contain the

ground of the possibility of the connexion of the

parts which would be a contradiction in discursive

cognition but only that the representation of a

whole may contain the ground of the possibility of

its form and the connexion of the parts belonging

to it now such a whole would be an effect product

the representation of which is regarded as the cause

of its possibility but the product of a cause whose

determining ground is merely the representation of

its effect is called a purpose hence it is merely a

consequence of the particular constitution of our

understanding that it represents products of nature

as possible according to a different kind of causality

from that of the natural laws of matter namely that

of purposes and final causes hence also this

principle has not to do with the possibility of such

things themselves even when considered as phenomena

according to the manner of their production

but merely with the judgement upon them which is

possible to our understanding here we see at

once why it is that in natural science we are not324

long contented with an explanation of the products

of nature by a causality according to purposes for

there we desire to judge of natural production merely

in a manner conformable to our faculty of judging

ie to the reflective judgement and not in reference

to things themselves on behalf of the determinant

judgement it is here not at all requisite to prove

that such an intellectus archetypus is possible but

only that we are led to the idea of itwhich

contains no contradictionin contrast to our discursive

understanding which has need of images

intellectus ectypus and to the contingency of its

constitution
if we consider a material whole according to its

form as a product of the parts with their powers

and faculties of combining with one another as well

as of bringing in foreign materials we represent

to ourselves a mechanical mode of producing it

but in this way no concept emerges of a whole

as purpose whose internal possibility presupposes

throughout the idea of a whole on which depend

the constitution and mode of action of the parts as

we must represent to ourselves an organised body

it does not follow indeed as has been shown that the

mechanical production of such a body is impossible

for to say so would be to say that it would be

impossible contradictory for any understanding to

represent to itself such a unity in the connexion of

the manifold without the idea of the unity being

at the same time its producing cause ie without

designed production this however would follow

in fact if we were justified in regarding material

beings as things in themselves for then the unity

that constitutes the ground of the possibility of

natural formations would be simply the unity of325

space but space is no real ground of the products

but only their formal condition although it has this

similarity to the real ground which we seek that in

it no part can be determined except in relation to the

whole the representation of which therefore lies at

the ground of the possibility of the parts but now

it is at least possible to consider the material world

as mere phenomenon and to think as its substrate

something like a thing in itself which is not phenomenon

and to attach to this a corresponding

intellectual intuition even though it is not ours

thus there would be although incognisable by us

a supersensible real ground for nature to which we

ourselves belong in this we consider according to

mechanical laws what is necessary in nature regarded

as an object of sense but we consider according to

teleological laws the agreement and unity of its

particular laws and its formswhich in regard to

mechanism we must judge contingentregarded as

objects of reason in fact the whole of nature as a

system thus we should judge nature according

to two different kinds of principles without the

mechanical way of explanation being shut out by

the teleological as if they contradicted one another
from this we are enabled to see what otherwise

though we could easily surmise it could with difficulty

be maintained with certainty and proved viz that

the principle of a mechanical derivation of purposive

natural products is consistent with the teleological

but in no way enables us to dispense with it in a

thing that we must judge as a natural purpose an

organised being we can no doubt try all the known

and yet to be discovered laws of mechanical production

and even hope to make good progress therewith

but we can never get rid of the call for a326

quite different ground of production for the possibility

of such a product viz causality by means of

purposes absolutely no human reason in fact

no finite reason like ours in quality however much

it may surpass it in degree can hope to understand

the production of even a blade of grass by mere

mechanical causes as regards the possibility of

such an object the teleological connexion of causes

and effects is quite indispensable for the judgement

even for studying it by the clue of experience for

external objects as phenomena an adequate ground

related to purposes cannot be met with this although

it lies in nature must only be sought in the supersensible

substrate of nature from all possible insight

into which we are cut off hence it is absolutely

impossible for us to produce from nature itself

grounds of explanation for purposive combinations

and it is necessary by the constitution of the human

cognitive faculties to seek the supreme ground of

these purposive combinations in an original understanding

as the cause of the world

 78 of the union of the principle of the universal

mechanism of matter with the teleological principle

in the technic of nature
it is infinitely important for reason not to let

slip the mechanism of nature in its products and in

their explanation not to pass it by because without

it no insight into the nature of things can be attained

suppose it admitted that a supreme architect

immediately created the forms of nature as they

have been from the beginning or that he predetermined

those which in the course of nature continually

form themselves on the same model our327

knowledge of nature is not thus in the least furthered

because we cannot know the mode of action of that

being and the ideas which are to contain the

principles of the possibility of natural beings and

we cannot by them explain nature as from above

downwards a priori and if starting from the

forms of the objects of experience from below

upwards a posteriori we wish to explain the

purposiveness which we believe is met with in experience

by appealing to a cause working in accordance

with purposes then is our explanation quite

tautological and we are only mocking reason with

words indeed when we lose ourselves with this

way of explanation in the transcendent whither

natural knowledge cannot follow reason is seduced

into poetical extravagance which it is its peculiar

destination to avoid
on the other hand it is just as necessary a

maxim of reason not to pass by the principle of

purposes in the products of nature for although

it does not make their mode of origination any more

comprehensible yet it is a heuristic principle for

investigating the particular laws of nature supposing

even that we wish to make no use of it for

explaining nature itselfin which we still always

speak only of natural purposes although it apparently

exhibits a designed unity of purposeie

without seeking beyond nature the ground of the

possibility of these particular laws but since we

must come in the end to this latter question it is

just as necessary to think for nature a particular kind

of causality which does not present itself in it as the

mechanism of natural causes which does to the

receptivity of several forms different from those of

which matter is susceptible by mechanism must be328

added a spontaneity of a cause which therefore

cannot be matter without which no ground can be

assigned for those forms no doubt reason before

it takes this step must proceed with caution and not

try to explain teleologically every technic of nature

ie every productive faculty of nature which displays

in itself as in regular bodies purposiveness of figure

to our mere apprehension but must always regard

such as so far mechanically possible but on that

account to wish entirely to exclude the teleological

principle and to follow simple mechanism onlyin

cases where in the rational investigation of the possibility

of natural forms through their causes purposiveness

shows itself quite undeniably as the reference

to a different kind of causalityto do this must make

reason fantastic and send it wandering among

chimeras of unthinkable natural faculties just as a

mere teleological mode of explanation which takes

no account of natural mechanism makes it visionary
in the same natural thing both principles cannot

be connected as fundamental propositions of explanation

deduction of one by the other ie they do not

unite for the determinant judgement as dogmatical

and constitutive principles of insight into nature if

i choose eg to regard a maggot as the product of

the mere mechanism of nature of the new formation

that it produces of itself when its elements are set

free by corruption i cannot derive the same product

from the same matter as from a causality that acts

according to purposes conversely if i regard the

same product as a natural purpose i cannot count

on any mechanical mode of its production and regard

this as the constitutive principle of my judgement

upon its possibility and so unite both principles

one method of explanation excludes the other329

even supposing that objectively both grounds of

the possibility of such a product rested on a single

ground to which we did not pay attention the

principle which should render possible the compatibility

of both in judging of nature must be placed

in that which lies outside both and consequently

outside the possible empirical representation of

nature but yet contains their ground ie in the

supersensible and each of the two methods of

explanation must be referred thereto now of this

we can have no concept but the indeterminate concept

of a ground which makes the judging of nature

by empirical laws possible but which we cannot

determine more nearly by any predicate hence the

union of both principles cannot rest upon a ground

of explanation of the possibility of a product according

to given laws for the determinant judgement but

only upon a ground of its exposition for the reflective

judgementto explain is to derive from a principle

which therefore we must clearly know and of which

we can give an account no doubt the principle of

the mechanism of nature and that of its causality

in one and the same natural product must coalesce

in a single higher principle which is their common

source because otherwise they could not subsist

side by side in the observation of nature but if

this principle objectively common to the two which

therefore warrants the association of the maxims of

natural investigation depending on both be such

that though it can be pointed to it cannot be

determinately known nor clearly put forward for

use in cases which arise then from such a principle

we can draw no explanation ie no clear and

determinate derivation of the possibility of a natural

product in accordance with those two heterogeneous330

principles but now the principle common to

the mechanical and teleological derivations is the

supersensible which we must place at the basis of

nature regarded as phenomenon and of this in a

theoretical point of view we cannot form the smallest

positive determinate concept it cannot therefore

in any way be explained how according to it as

principle nature in its particular laws constitutes

for us one system which can be cognised as possible

either by the principle of physical development or

by that of final causes if it happens that objects

of nature present themselves which cannot be

thought by us as regards their possibility according

to the principle of mechanism which always has

a claim on a natural being without relying on

teleological propositions we can only make an hypothesis

namely we suppose that we may hopefully

investigate natural laws with reference to both

according as the possibility of its product is

cognisable by our understanding by one or the

other principle without stumbling at the apparent

contradiction which comes into view between the

principles by which they are judged for at least

the possibility is assured that both may be united

objectively in one principle since they concern phenomena

that presuppose a supersensible ground
mechanism then and the teleological designed

technic of nature in respect of the same product

and its possibility may stand under a common

supreme principle of nature in particular laws but

since this principle is transcendent we cannot because

of the limitation of our understanding unite both

principles in the explanation of the same production

of nature even if the inner possibility of this product

is only intelligible verstndlich through a causality331

according to purposes as is the case with organised

matter we revert then to the above fundamental

proposition of teleology according to the constitution

of the human understanding no other

than designedlyworking causes can be assumed

for the possibility of organised beings in nature

and the mere mechanism of nature cannot be

adequate to the explanation of these its products

but we do not attempt to decide anything by this

fundamental proposition as to the possibility of such

things themselves
this is only a maxim of the reflective not of

the determinant judgement consequently only subjectively

valid for us not objectively for the possibility

of things themselves of this kind in which

both kinds of production may well cohere in one

and the same ground further without any conceptbesides

the teleologically conceived method

of productionof a simultaneously presented

mechanism of nature no judgement can be passed

on this kind of production as a natural product

hence the above maxim leads to the necessity of

an unification of both principles in judging of things

as natural purposes in themselves but does not lead

us to substitute one for the other either altogether

or in certain parts for in the place of what is

thought at least by us as possible only by design

we cannot set mechanism and in the place of what

is cognised as mechanically necessary we cannot set

contingency which would need a purpose as its determining

ground but we can only subordinate the

one mechanism to the other designed technic

which may quite well be the case according to the

transcendental principle of the purposiveness of

nature
332

for where purposes are thought as grounds of

the possibility of certain things we must assume

also means whose law of working requires for

itself nothing presupposing a purposea mechanical

lawand yet can be a subordinate cause of designed

effects thusin the organic products

of nature and specially when prompted by their infinite

number we assume at least as a permissible

hypothesis design in the combination of natural

causes by particular laws as a universal principle

of the reflective judgement for the whole of

nature the worldwe can think a great and

indeed universal combination of mechanical with

teleological laws in the productions of nature

without interchanging the principles by which they

are judged or putting one in the place of the other

for in a teleological judgement the matter even if

the form that it assumes be judged possible only

by design can also conformably to the mechanical

laws of its nature be subordinated as a means to

the represented purpose but since the ground of

this compatibility lies in that which is neither one

nor the other neither mechanism nor purposive

combination but is the supersensible substrate of

nature of which we know nothing the two ways of

representing the possibility of such objects are not

to be blended together by our human reason

however we cannot judge of their possibility

otherwise than by judging them as ultimately

resting on a supreme understanding by the

connexion of final causes and thus the teleological

method of explanation is not eliminated
now it is quite indeterminate and for our

understanding always indeterminable how much

the mechanism of nature does as a means towards333

each final design in nature however on account

of the abovementioned intelligible principle of

the possibility of a nature in general it may be

assumed that it is possible throughout according to

the two kinds of universally accordant laws the

physical and those of final causes although we

cannot see into the way how this takes place

hence we do not know how far the mechanical

method of explanation which is possible for us may

extend so much only is certain that so far as we

can go in this direction it must always be inadequate

for things that we once recognise as natural

purposes and therefore we must by the constitution

of our understanding subordinate these

grounds collectively to a teleological principle
hereon is based a privilege and on account of

the importance which the study of nature by the

principle of mechanism has for the theoretical use of

our reason also an appeal we should explain all

products and occurrences in nature even the most

purposive by mechanism as far as is in our power

the limits of which we cannot specify in this kind

of investigation but at the same time we are

not to lose sight of the fact that those things which

we cannot even state for investigation except under

the concept of a purpose of reason must in conformity

with the essential constitution of our

reason mechanical causes notwithstanding be

subordinated by us finally to causality in accordance

with purposes

334

methodology of

the teleological judgement119
 79 whether teleology must be treated as if it

belonged to the doctrine of nature
every science must have its definite position in

the encyclopaedia of all the sciences if it is a

philosophical science its position must be either in

the theoretical or practical part if again it has

its place in the former of these it must be either in

the doctrine of nature so far as it concerns that

which can be an object of experience in the

doctrine of bodies the doctrine of the soul or the

universal science of the world or in the doctrine

of god the original ground of the world as the

complex of all objects of experience
now the question is what place is due to

teleology does it belong to natural science

properly so called or to theology one of the

two it must be for no science belongs to the

transition from one to the other because this

transition only marks the articulation or organisation

of the system and not a place in it
that it does not belong to theology as a part

thereof although it may be made of the most

important use therein is selfevident for it has as335

its objects natural productions and their cause and

although it refers at the same time to the latter as

to a ground lying outside of and beyond nature a

divine author yet it does not do this for the

determinant but only for the reflective judgement in

the consideration of nature in order to guide our

judgement on things in the world by means of such

an idea as a regulative principle in conformity with

the human understanding
but it appears to belong just as little to natural

science which needs determinant and not merely

reflective principles in order to supply objective

grounds for natural effects in fact nothing is

gained for the theory of nature or the mechanical

explanation of its phenomena by means of its

effective causes by considering them as connected

according to the relation of purposes the

exhibition of the purposes of nature in its products

so far as they constitute a system according to

teleological concepts properly belongs only to a

description of nature which is drawn up in accordance

with a particular guiding thread here

reason no doubt accomplishes a noble work

instructive and practically purposive in many points

of view but it gives no information as to the

origin and the inner possibility of these forms

which is the special business of theoretical natural

science teleology therefore as science belongs

to no doctrine but only to criticism and to the

criticism of a special cognitive faculty viz judgement

but so far as it contains principles a priori it

can and must furnish the method by which nature

must be judged according to the principle of final

causes hence its methodology has at least negative

influence upon the procedure in theoretical natural336

science and also upon the relation which this can

have in metaphysic to theology as its propaedeutic

 80 of the necessary subordination of the mechanical

to the teleological principle in the explanation

of a thing as a natural purpose
the privilege of aiming at a merely mechanical

method of explanation of all natural products is in

itself quite unlimited but the faculty of attaining

thereto is by the constitution of our understanding

so far as it has to do with things as natural purposes

not only very much limited but also clearly bounded

for according to a principle of the judgement by

this process alone nothing can be accomplished

towards an explanation of these things and consequently

the judgement upon such products must

always be at the same time subordinated by us to a

teleological principle
it is therefore rational even meritorious to

pursue natural mechanism in respect of the explanation

of natural products so far as can be done

with probability and if we give up the attempt it is

not because it is impossible in itself to meet in this

path with the purposiveness of nature but only

because it is impossible for us as men for there

would be required for that an intuition other than

sensuous and a determinate knowledge of the

intelligible substrate of nature from which a ground

could be assigned for the mechanism of phenomena

according to particular laws which quite surpasses

our faculties
hence if the naturalist would not waste his

labour he must in judging of things the concept of337

any of which is indubitably established as a natural

purpose organised beings always lay down as

basis an original organisation which uses that very

mechanism in order to produce fresh organised

forms or to develop the existing ones into new

shapes which however always result from that

purpose and conformably to it
it is praiseworthy by the aid of comparative

anatomy to go through the great creation of organised

natures in order to see whether there may not

be in it something similar to a system and also in

accordance with the principle of production for

otherwise we should have to be content with the

mere principle of judgement which gives no insight

into their production and discouraged to give up

all claim to natural insight in this field the agreement

of so many genera of animals in a certain

common schema which appears to be fundamental

not only in the structure of their bones but also in

the disposition of their remaining partsso that

with an admirable simplicity of original outline a

great variety of species has been produced by the

shortening of one member and the lengthening of

another the involution of this part and the evolution

of thatallows a ray of hope however faint to

penetrate into our minds that here something may

be accomplished by the aid of the principle of the

mechanism of nature without which there can be no

natural science in general this analogy of forms

which with all their differences seem to have been

produced according to a common original type

strengthens our suspicions of an actual relationship

between them in their production from a common

parent through the gradual approximation of one

animalgenus to anotherfrom those in which the338

principle of purposes seems to be best authenticated

ie from man down to the polype and again from

this down to mosses and lichens and finally to the

lowest stage of nature noticeable by us viz to crude

matter and so the whole technic of nature which

is so incomprehensible to us in organised beings

that we believe ourselves compelled to think a

different principle for it seems to be derived from

matter and its powers according to mechanical laws

like those by which it works in the formation of

crystals
here it is permissible for the archaeologist of

nature to derive from the surviving traces of its

oldest revolutions according to all its mechanism

known or supposed by him that great family of

creatures for so we must represent them if the said

thoroughgoing relationship is to have any ground

he can suppose the bosom of mother earth as she

passed out of her chaotic state like a great animal

to have given birth in the beginning to creatures of

less purposive form that these again gave birth to

others which formed themselves with greater adaptation

to their place of birth and their relations to each

other until this womb becoming torpid and ossified

limited its births to definite species not further

modifiable and the manifoldness remained as it

was at the end of the operation of that fruitful

formative poweronly he must still in the end

ascribe to this universal mother an organisation

purposive in respect of all these creatures otherwise

it would not be possible to think the possibility of

the purposive form of the products of the animal and

vegetable kingdoms120 he has then only pushed339

further back the ground of explanation and cannot

pretend to have made the development of those two

kingdoms independent of the condition of final

causes
even as concerns the variation to which certain

individuals of organised genera are accidentally

subjected if we find that the character so changed

is hereditary and is taken up into the generative

power then we cannot pertinently judge the variation

to be anything else than an occasional development

of purposive capacities originally present in

the species with a view to the preservation of the

race for in the complete inner purposiveness of

an organised being the generation of its like is

closely bound up with the condition of taking

nothing up into the generative power which does

not belong in such a system of purposes to one of

its undeveloped original capacities indeed if we

depart from this principle we cannot know with

certainty whether several parts of the form which is

now apparent in a species have not a contingent and

unpurposive origin and the principle of teleology

to judge nothing in an organised being as unpurposive340

which maintains it in its propagation would

be very unreliable in its application and would be

valid solely for the original stock of which we have

no further knowledge
hume121 takes exception to those who find it requisite

to assume for all such natural purposes a teleological

principle of judgement ie an architectonic

understanding he says that it may fairly be asked

how is such an understanding possible how can

the manifold faculties and properties that constitute

the possibility of an understanding which has at the

same time executive force be found so purposively

together in one being but this objection is without

weight for the whole difficulty which surrounds

the question concerning the first production of a

thing containing in itself purposes and only comprehensible

by means of them rests on the further

question as to the unity of the ground of the combination

in this product of the various elements des

mannichfaltigen which are external to one another

for if this ground be placed in the understanding of

a producing cause as simple substance the question

so far as it is teleological is sufficiently answered

but if the cause be sought merely in matter as an341

aggregate of many substances external to one

another the unity of the principle is quite wanting

for the internally purposive form of its formation

and the autocracy of matter in productions which

can only be conceived by our understanding as

purposes is a word without meaning
hence it comes to pass that those who seek a

supreme ground of possibility for the objectivelypurposive

forms of matter without attributing to it

understanding either make the worldwhole into

a single allembracing substance pantheism or

which is only a more determinate explanation of

the former into a complex of many determinations

inhering in a single simple substance spinozism

merely in order to satisfy that condition of all

purposivenessthe unity of ground thus they do

justice indeed to one condition of the problem viz

the unity in the purposive combination by means of

the mere ontological concept of a simple substance

but they adduce nothing for the other condition

viz the relation of this substance to its result as

purpose through which relation that ontological

ground is to be more closely determined in respect

of the question at issue hence they answer the

whole question in no way it remains absolutely

unanswerable for our reason if we do not represent

that original ground of things as simple

substance its property which has reference to the

specific constitution of the forms of nature grounded

thereon viz its purposive unity as the property of

an intelligent substance and the relation of these

forms to this intelligence on account of the contingency

which we ascribe to everything that we think

possible only as a purpose as that of causality
342
 81 of the association of mechanism with the teleological

principle in the explanation of a natural

purpose as a natural product
according to the preceding paragraphs the

mechanism of nature alone does not enable us to

think the possibility of an organised being but at

least according to the constitution of our cognitive

faculty it must be originally subordinated to a

cause working designedly but just as little is the

mere teleological ground of such a being sufficient

for considering it and judging it as a product of

nature if the mechanism of the latter be not associated

with the former like the instrument of a cause

working designedly to whose purposes nature is

subordinated in its mechanical laws the possibility

of such a unification of two quite different

kinds of causalityof nature in its universal conformity

to law with an idea which limits it to a

particular form for which it contains no ground in

itselfis not comprehended by our reason it lies

in the supersensible substrate of nature of which we

can determine nothing positively except that it is

the being in itself of which we merely know the

phenomenon but the principle all that we assume

as belonging to this nature phenomenon and

as its product must be thought as connected therewith

according to mechanical laws has none the

less force because without this kind of causality

organised beings as purposes of nature would not

be natural products
now if the teleological principle of the production

of these beings be assumed as is inevitable

we can place at the basis of the cause of their343

internally purposive form either occasionalism or

preestablished harmony according to the former

the supreme cause of the world would conformably

to its idea furnish immediately the organic

formation on the occasion of every union of intermingling

materials according to the latter it

would in the original products of its wisdom only

have supplied the capacity by means of which an

organic being produces another of like kind and

the species perpetually maintains itself whilst the

loss of individuals is continually replaced by that

nature which at the same time works towards their

destruction if we assume the occasionalism of the

production of organised beings all nature is quite

lost and with it all employment of reason in judging

of the possibility of such products hence we may

suppose that no one will adopt this system who has

anything to do with philosophy
the theory of preestablished harmony may

proceed in two different ways it regards every

organised being as generated by one of like kind

either as an educt or a product the system which

regards generations as mere educts is called the

theory of individual preformation or the theory of

evolution that which regards them as products is

entitled the system of epigenesis this latter may

also be entitled the system of generic preformation

because the productive faculty of the generator and

consequently the specific form would be virtually

performed according to the inner purposive capacities

which are part of its stock in correspondence with

this the opposite theory of individual preformations

would be better entitled the theory of involution
the advocates of the theory of evolution who

remove every individual from the formative power344

of nature in order to make it come immediately

from the hand of the creator would however not

venture to regard this as happening according to

the hypothesis of occasionalism for according to

this the copulation is a mere formality  propos of

which a supreme intelligent cause of the world has

concluded to form a fruit immediately by his hand

and only to leave to the mother its development and

nourishment they declare themselves for preformation

as if it were not all the same whether a

supernatural origin is assigned to these forms in the

beginning or in the course of the world on the

contrary a great number of supernatural arrangements

would be spared by occasional creation which

would be requisite in order that the embryo formed

in the beginning of the world might not be injured

throughout the long period of its development by the

destructive powers of nature and might keep itself

unharmed and there would also be requisite an incalculably

greater number of such preformed beings

than would ever be developed and with them many

creations would be made without need and without

purpose they would however be willing to leave

at least something to nature so as not to fall into a

complete hyperphysic which can dispense with all

natural explanations it is true they hold so fast

by their hyperphysic that they find even in abortions

which it is quite impossible to take for purposes of

nature an admirable purposiveness though it be

only directed to the fact that an anatomist would

take exception to it as a purposeless purposiveness

and would feel a disheartened wonder thereat but

the production of hybrids could absolutely not be

accommodated with the system of preformation

and to the seeds of the male creature to which they345

had attributed nothing but the mechanical property

of serving as the first means of nourishment for the

embryo they must attribute in addition a purposive

formative power which in the case of the product of

two creatures of the same genus they would concede

to neither parent
on the other hand even if we do not recognise

the great superiority which the theory of epigenesis

has over the former as regards the empirical grounds

of its proof still prior to proof reason views this

way of explanation with peculiar favour for in

respect of the things which we can only represent

as possible originally according to the causality of

purposes at least as concerns their propagation this

theory regards nature as selfproducing not merely

as selfevolving and so with the least expenditure

of the supernatural leaves to nature all that follows

after the first beginning though without determining

anything about this first beginning by which physic

generally is thwarted however it may essay its

explanation by a chain of causes
as regards this theory of epigenesis no one has

contributed more either to its proof or to the establishment

of the legitimate principles of its applicationpartly

by the limitation of a too presumptuous employment

of itthan herr hofr blumenbach122 in

all physical explanations of these formations he

starts from organised matter that crude matter

should have originally formed itself according to

mechanical laws that life should have sprung from

the nature of what is lifeless that matter should

have been able to dispose itself into the form346

of a selfmaintaining purposivenessthis he rightly

declares to be contradictory to reason but at the

same time he leaves to natural mechanism under

this to us indispensable principle of an original

organisation an undeterminable but yet unmistakeable

element in reference to which the faculty of

matter in an organised body is called by him a

formative impulse in contrast to and yet standing

under the higher guidance and direction of that

merely mechanical formative power universally resident

in matter
 82 of the teleological system in the external

relations of organised beings
by external purposiveness i mean that by which

one thing of nature serves another as means to a

purpose now things which have no internal purposiveness

and which presuppose none for their

possibility eg earth air water etc may at the same

time be very purposive externally ie in relation to

other beings but these latter must be organised

beings ie natural purposes for otherwise the former

could not be judged as means to them thus water

air and earth cannot be regarded as means to the

raising of mountains because mountains contain

nothing in themselves that requires a ground of

their possibility according to purposes in reference to

which therefore their cause can never be represented

under the predicate of a means as useful therefor
external purposiveness is a quite different concept

from that of internal purposiveness which

is bound up with the possibility of an object irrespective

of its actuality being itself a purpose we

can ask about an organised being the question347

what is it for but we cannot easily ask this

about things in which we recognise merely the

working of natures mechanism for in the

former as regards their internal possibility we represent

a causality according to purposes a creative

understanding and we refer this active faculty to

its determining ground viz design there is only

one external purposiveness which is connected with

the internal purposiveness of organisation and yet

serves in the external relation of a means to a

purpose without the question necessarily arising as

to what end this being so organised must have

existed for this is the organisation of both sexes

in their mutual relation for the propagation of their

kind since here we can always ask as in the case

of an individual why must such a pair exist the

answer is this pair first constitutes an organising

whole though not an organised whole in a single

body
if we now ask wherefore anything is the answer

is either its presence and its production have no

reference at all to a cause working according to

design and so we always refer its origin to the

mechanism of nature or there is somewhere a designed

ground of its presence as a contingent natural

being this thought we can hardly separate from

the concept of an organised thing for since we

must place at the basis of its internal possibility a

causality of final causes and an idea lying at the

ground of this we cannot think the existence of this

product except as a purpose for the represented

effect the representation of which is at the same

time the determining ground of the intelligent cause

working towards its production is called a purpose

in this case therefore we can either say the348

purpose of the existence of such a natural being

is in itself ie it is not merely a purpose but a

final purpose or this is external to it in another

natural being ie it exists purposively not as a

final purpose but necessarily as a means
but if we go through the whole of nature

we find in it as nature no being which could

make claim to the eminence of being the final

purpose of creation and we can even prove a priori

that what might be for nature an ultimate purpose

according to all the thinkable determinations and

properties wherewith one could endow it could yet

as a natural thing never be a final purpose
if we consider the vegetable kingdom we might

at first sight on account of the immeasurable

fertility with which it spreads itself almost on every

soil be led to take it for a mere product of that

mechanism which nature displays in the formations

of the mineral kingdom but a more intimate

knowledge of its indescribably wise organisation

does not permit us to hold to this thought but

prompts the question what are these things

created for if it is answered for the animal

kingdom which is thereby nourished and has thus

been able to spread over the earth in genera so

various then the further question comes what

are these plantdevouring animals for the answer

would be something like this for beasts of prey

which can only be nourished by that which has life

finally we have the question what are these last

as well as the firstmentioned natural kingdoms

good for for man in reference to the manifold

use which his understanding teaches him to make

of all these creatures he is the ultimate purpose

of creation here on earth because he is the only349

being upon it who can form a concept of purposes

and who can by his reason make out of an

aggregate of purposively formed things a system of

purposes
we might also with the chevalier linnaeus123 go

the apparently opposite way and say the herbivorous

animals are there to moderate the luxurious

growth of the vegetable kingdom by which many

of its species are choked the carnivora are to set

bounds to the voracity of the herbivora finally

man by his pursuit of these and his diminution

of their numbers preserves a certain equilibrium

between the producing and the destructive powers

of nature and so man although in a certain

reference he might be esteemed a purpose yet in

another has only the rank of a means
if an objective purposiveness in the variety of

the genera of creatures and their external relations

to one another as purposively constructed beings

be made a principle then it is conformable to reason

to conceive in these relations a certain organisation

and a system of all natural kingdoms according

to final causes only here experience seems flatly

to contradict the maxims of reason especially as

concerns an ultimate purpose of nature which is

indispensable for the possibility of such a system

and which we can put nowhere else but in man

for regarding him as one of the many animal

genera nature has not in the least excepted him

from its destructive or its productive powers but

has subjected everything to a mechanism thereof

without any purpose
the first thing that must be designedly prepared350

in an arrangement for a purposive complex of

natural beings on the earth would be their place

of habitation the soil and the element on and in

which they are to thrive but a more exact knowledge

of the constitution of this basis of all organic

production indicates no other causes than those

working quite undesignedly causes which rather

destroy than favour production order and purposes

land and sea not only contain in themselves

memorials of ancient mighty desolations which have

confounded them and all creatures that are in them

but their whole structure the strata of the one

and the boundaries of the other have quite the

appearance of being the product of the wild and

violent forces of a nature working in a state of chaos

although the figure the structure and the slope of

the land might seem to be purposively ordered

for the reception of water from the air for the

welling up of streams between strata of different

kinds for many kinds of products and for the

course of riversyet a closer investigation shows

that they are merely the effects of volcanic eruptions

or of inundations of the ocean as regards not only

the first production of this figure but above all its

subsequent transformation as well as the disappearance

of its first organic productions124 now if the

place of habitation of all these creatures the soil351

of the land or the bosom of the sea indicates

nothing but a quite undesigned mechanism of its

production how and with what right can we demand

and maintain a different origin for these latter

products the closest examination indeed in

campers125 judgement of the remains of the aforesaid

devastations of nature seems to show that man was

not comprehended in these revolutions but yet he

is so dependent on the remaining creatures that if

a universally directing mechanism of nature be

admitted in the case of the others he must also

be regarded as comprehended under it even though

his understanding for the most part at least has

been able to deliver him from these devastations
but this argument seems to prove more than

was intended by it it seems to prove not merely

that man cannot be the ultimate purpose of nature

and that on the same grounds the aggregate of

the organised things of nature on the earth cannot

be a system of purposes but also that the natural

products formerly held to be natural purposes have

no other origin than the mechanism of nature
but in the solution given above of the antinomy

of the principles of the mechanical and teleological

methods of production of organic beings of nature

we have seen that they are merely principles of

the reflective judgement in respect of nature as it

produces forms in accordance with particular laws

for the systematic connexion of which we have no

key they do not determine the origin of these

beings in themselves but only say that we by the

constitution of our understanding and our reason

cannot conceive it in this kind of being except

according to final causes the greatest possible352

effort even audacity in the attempt to explain

them mechanically is not only permitted but we

are invited to it by reason notwithstanding that

we know from the subjective grounds of the particular

species and limitations of our understanding not

eg because the mechanism of production would

contradict in itself an origin according to purposes

that we can never attain thereto finally the

compatibility of both ways of representing the

possibility of nature may lie in the supersensible

principle of nature external to us as well as in

us whilst the method of representation according

to final causes may be only a subjective condition

of the use of our reason when it not merely wishes

to form a judgement upon objects as phenomena

but desires to refer these phenomena together with

their principles to their supersensible substrate in

order to find certain laws of their unity possible

which it cannot represent to itself except through

purposes of which the reason also has such as

are supersensible
 83 of the ultimate purpose of nature as a

teleological system
we have shown in the preceding that though

not for the determinant but for the reflective

judgement we have sufficient cause for judging

man to be not merely like all organised beings

a natural purpose but also the ultimate purpose of

nature here on earth in reference to whom all

other natural things constitute a system of purposes

according to fundamental propositions of reason

if now that must be found in man himself which

is to be furthered as a purpose by means of his353

connexion with nature this purpose must either

be of a kind that can be satisfied by nature in

its beneficence or it is the aptitude and skill for

all kinds of purposes for which nature external

and internal can be used by him the first

purpose of nature would be mans happiness the

second his culture
the concept of happiness is not one that

man derives by abstraction from his instincts and

so deduces from his animal nature but it is a

mere idea of a state that he wishes to make

adequate to the idea under merely empirical

conditions which is impossible this idea he

projects in such different ways on account of the

complication of his understanding with imagination

and sense and changes so often that nature even

if it were entirely subjected to his elective will

could receive absolutely no determinate universal

and fixed law so as to harmonise with this vacillating

concept and thus with the purpose which each

man arbitrarily sets before himself and even if

we reduce this to the true natural wants as to

which our race is thoroughly agreed or on the

other hand raise ever so high mans skill to

accomplish his imagined purposes yet even thus

what man understands by happiness and what is

in fact his proper ultimate natural purpose not

purpose of freedom would never be attained by

him for it is not his nature to rest and be

contented with the possession and enjoyment of

anything whatever on the other side too there

is something wanting nature has not taken him

for her special darling and favoured him with

benefit above all animals rather in her destructive

operationsplague hunger perils of waters frost354

assaults of other animals great and small etcin

these things has she spared him as little as any

other animal further the inconsistency of his

own natural dispositions drives him into selfdevised

torments and also reduces others of his own race to

misery by the oppression of lordship the barbarism

of war and so forth he himself as far as in him

lies works for the destruction of his own race so

that even with the most beneficent external nature

its purpose if it were directed to the happiness

of our species would not be attained in an earthly

system because our nature is not susceptible of it

man is then always only a link in the chain of

natural purposes a principle certainly in respect

of many purposes for which nature seems to have

destined him in her disposition and towards which he

sets himself but also a means for the maintenance

of purposiveness in the mechanism of the remaining

links as the only being on earth which has an

understanding and consequently a faculty of setting

arbitrary purposes before itself he is certainly entitled

to be the lord of nature and if it be regarded

as a teleological system he is by his destination the

ultimate purpose of nature but this is subject to

the condition of his having an understanding and

the will to give to it and to himself such a reference

to purposes as can be selfsufficient independently

of nature and consequently can be a final purpose

which however must not be sought in nature itself
but in order to find out where in man we have

to place that ultimate purpose of nature we must

seek out what nature can supply to prepare him

for what he must do himself in order to be a final

purpose and we must separate it from all those

purposes whose possibility depends upon things355

that one can expect only from nature of the

latter kind is earthly happiness by which is understood

the complex of all mans purposes possible

through nature whether external nature or mans

nature ie the matter of all his earthly purposes

which if he makes it his whole purpose renders

him incapable of positing his own existence as a

final purpose and being in harmony therewith

there remains therefore of all his purposes in

nature only the formal subjective condition viz

the aptitude of setting purposes in general before

himself and independent of nature in his purposive

determination of using nature conformably to the

maxims of his free purposes in general as a means

this nature can do in regard to the final purpose

that lies outside it and it therefore may be regarded

as its ultimate purpose the production of the

aptitude of a rational being for arbitrary purposes

in general consequently in his freedom is culture

therefore culture alone can be the ultimate purpose

which we have cause for ascribing to nature in

respect to the human race not mans earthly happiness

or the fact that he is the chief instrument

of instituting order and harmony in irrational nature

external to himself
but all culture is not adequate to this ultimate

purpose of nature the culture of skill is indeed the

chief subjective condition of aptitude for furthering

ones purposes in general but it is not adequate to

furthering the will126 in the determination and choice

of purposes which yet essentially belongs to the

whole extent of an aptitude for purposes the

latter condition of aptitude which we might call

the culture of training discipline is negative and356

consists in the freeing of the will from the despotism

of desires by these tied as we are to certain

natural things we are rendered incapable even of

choosing while we allow those impulses to serve as

fetters which nature has given us as guiding

threads that we should not neglect or violate the

destination of our animal naturewe being all the

time free enough to strain or relax to extend

or diminish them according as the purposes of

reason require
skill cannot be developed in the human race

except by means of inequality among men for the

great majority provide the necessities of life as it

were mechanically without requiring any art in

particular for the convenience and leisure of others

who work at the less necessary elements of culture

science and art in an oppressed condition they

have hard work and little enjoyment although

much of the culture of the higher classes gradually

spreads to them yet with the progress of this

culture the height of which is called luxury reached

when the propensity to what can be done without

begins to be injurious to what is indispensable

their calamities increase equally in two directions

on the one hand through violence from without on

the other hand through internal discontent but

still this splendid misery is bound up with the

development of the natural capacities of the human

race and the purpose of nature itself although not

our purpose is thus attained the formal condition

under which nature can alone attain this its final

design is that arrangement of mens relations to one

another by which lawful authority in a whole which

we call a civil community is opposed to the abuse

of their conflicting freedoms only in this can the357

greatest development of natural capacities take

place for this also there would be requisiteif

men were clever enough to find it out and wise

enough to submit themselves voluntarily to its

constrainta cosmopolitan whole ie a system of

all states that are in danger of acting injuriously

upon each other127 failing this and with the

obstacles which ambition lust of dominion and

avarice especially in those who have the authority

in their hands oppose even to the possibility of

such a scheme there is inevitably war by

which sometimes states subdivide and resolve

themselves into smaller states sometimes a state

annexes other smaller states and strives to form a

greater whole though war is an undesigned

enterprise of men stirred up by their unbridled

passions yet is it perhaps128 a deephidden and

designed enterprise of supreme wisdom for preparing

if not for establishing conformity to law

amid the freedom of states and with this a unity

of a morally grounded system of those states in

spite of the dreadful afflictions with which it visits

the human race and the perhaps greater afflictions

with which the constant preparation for it in time

of peace oppresses them yet is it although the

hope for a restful state of popular happiness is ever

further off a motive for developing all talents serviceable

for culture to the highest possible pitch129
as concerns the discipline of the inclinations358for

which our natural capacity in regard of our

destination as an animal race is quite purposive but

which render the development of humanity very

difficultthere is manifest in respect of this second

requirement for culture a purposive striving of

nature to a cultivation which makes us receptive of

higher purposes than nature itself can supply we

cannot strive against the preponderance of evil

which is poured out upon us by the refinement of

taste pushed to idealisation and even by the luxury

of science as affording food for pride through the

insatiable number of inclinations thus aroused but

yet we cannot mistake the purpose of natureever

aiming to win us away from the rudeness and violence

of those inclinations inclinations to enjoyment

which belong rather to our animality and for the

most part are opposed to the cultivation of our higher

destiny and to make way for the development of

our humanity the beautiful arts and the sciences

which by their universallycommunicable pleasure

and by the polish and refinement of society make

man more civilised if not morally better win us in

large measure from the tyranny of sensepropensions

and thus prepare men for a lordship in which

reason alone shall have authority whilst the evils

with which we are visited partly by nature partly

by the intolerant selfishness of men summon

strengthen and harden the powers of the soul not

to submit to them and so make us feel an

aptitude for higher purposes which lies hidden

in us130
359
 84 of the final purpose of the existence of a

world ie of creation itself
a final purpose is that purpose which needs no

other as condition of its possibility
if the mere mechanism of nature be assumed as

the ground of explanation of its purposiveness we

cannot ask what are things in the world there for

for according to such an idealistic system it is only

the physical possibility of things to think which as

purposes would be mere subtlety without any object

that is under discussion whether we refer this form

of things to chance or to blind necessity in either

case the question would be vain if however we

assume the purposive combination in the world to

be real and to be brought about by a particular kind

of causality viz that of a designedlyworking cause

we cannot stop at the question why have things

of the world organised beings this or that form

why are they placed by nature in this or that relation

to one another but once an understanding

is thought that must be regarded as the cause of

the possibility of such forms as are actually

found in things it must be also asked on objective

grounds who could have determined this productive

understanding to an operation of this kind360

this being is then the final purpose in reference to

which such things are there
i have said above that the final purpose is not a

purpose which nature would be competent to bring

about and to produce in conformity with its idea

because it is unconditioned for there is nothing

in nature regarded as a sensible being for which

the determining ground present in itself would not

be always conditioned and this holds not merely

of external material nature but also of internal

thinking natureit being of course understood

that i only am considering that in myself which is

nature but a thing that is to exist necessarily

on account of its objective constitution as the final

purpose of an intelligent cause must be of the kind

that in the order of purposes it is dependent on no

further condition than merely its idea
now we have in the world only one kind of

beings whose causality is teleological ie is directed

to purposes and is at the same time so constituted

that the law according to which they have to determine

purposes for themselves is represented as

unconditioned and independent of natural conditions

and yet as in itself necessary the being of this

kind is man but man considered as noumenon the

only natural being in which we can recognise on the

side of its peculiar constitution a supersensible

faculty freedom and also the law of causality

together with its object which this faculty may

propose to itself as highest purpose the highest

good in the world
now of man and so of every rational creature

in the world as a moral being it can no longer

be asked why quem in finem he exists his

existence involves the highest purpose to which361

as far as is in his power he can subject the

whole of nature contrary to which at least he

cannot regard himself as subject to any influence

of natureif now things of the world as beings

dependent in their existence need a supreme cause

acting according to purposes man is the final purpose

of creation since without him the chain of

mutually subordinated purposes would not be complete

as regards its ground only in man and

only in him as subject of morality do we meet

with unconditioned legislation in respect of purposes

which therefore alone renders him capable of being

a final purpose to which the whole of nature is

teleologically subordinated131
362
 85 of physicotheology
physicotheology is the endeavour of reason to

infer the supreme cause of nature and its properties

from the purposes of nature which can only be empirically

known moral theology ethicotheology

would be the endeavour to infer that cause and its

properties from the moral purpose of rational beings

in nature which can be known a priori
the former naturally precedes the latter for if

we wish to infer a world cause teleologically from

the things in the world purposes of nature must

first be given for which we afterwards have to seek

a final purpose and for this the principle of the

causality of this supreme cause
many investigations of nature can and must be

conducted according to the teleological principle

without our having cause to inquire into the ground

of the possibility of purposive working with which

we meet in various products of nature but if we

wish to have a concept of this we have absolutely

no further insight into it than the maxim of the

reflective judgement affords viz if only a single

organic product of nature were given to us by the

constitution of our cognitive faculty we could think

no other ground for it than that of a cause of nature

itself whether the whole of nature or only this bit

of it which contains the causality for it through

understanding this principle of judging though

it does not bring us any further in the explanation of

natural things and their origin yet discloses to us an

outlook over nature by which perhaps we may be

able to determine more closely the concept otherwise

so unfruitful of an original being
363

now i say that physicotheology however far it

may be pursued can disclose to us nothing of a final

purpose of creation for it does not even extend to

the question as to this it can it is true justify the

concept of an intelligent world cause as a subjective

concept only available for the constitution of

our cognitive faculty of the possibility of things

that we can make intelligible to ourselves according

to purposes but it cannot determine this concept

further either in a theoretical or a practical point of

view its endeavour does not come up to its design

of being the basis of a theology but it always

remains only a physical teleology because the

purposive reference therein is and must be always

considered only as conditioned in nature and it

consequently cannot inquire into the purpose for

which nature itself exists for which the ground must

be sought outside naturenotwithstanding that it

is upon the determinate idea of this that the determinate

concept of that supreme intelligent world

cause and the consequent possibility of a theology

depend
what the things in the world are mutually

useful for what good the manifold in a thing does

for the thing how we have ground to assume that

nothing in the world is in vain but that everything

in nature is good for somethingthe condition being

granted that certain things are to exist as purposes

whence our reason has in its power for the judgement

no other principle of the possibility of the

object which it inevitably judges teleologically

than that of subordinating the mechanism of nature

to the architectonic of an intelligent author of the

worldall this the teleological consideration of the

world supplies us with excellently and to our extreme364

admiration but because the data and so the

principles for determining that concept of an intelligent

world cause as highest artist are merely

empirical they do not enable us to infer any

of its properties beyond those which experience

reveals in its effects now experience since it

can never embrace collective nature as a system

must often apparently happen upon this concept

and by mutually conflicting grounds of proof but

it can never even if we had the power of surveying

empirically the whole system as far as it concerns

mere nature raise us above nature to the purpose of

its existence and so to the determinate concept of

that supreme intelligence
if we lessen the problem with the solution of

which physicotheology has to do its solution appears

easy if we reduce the concept of a deity to that

of an intelligent being thought by us of which there

may be one or more which possesses many and very

great properties but not all the properties which are

requisite for the foundation of a nature in harmony

with the greatest possible purpose or if we do not

scruple in a theory to supply by arbitrary additions

what is deficient in the grounds of proof and so

where we have only ground for assuming much

perfection and what is much for us consider

ourselves entitled to presuppose all possible perfection

thus indeed physical teleology may make

weighty claims to the distinction of being the basis

of a theology but if we are desired to point out

what impels and moreover authorises us to add these

supplements then we shall seek in vain for a ground

of justification in the principles of the theoretical

use of reason which is ever desirous in the explanation

of an object of experience to ascribe to365

it no more properties than those for which empirical

data of possibility are to be found on closer examination

we should see that properly speaking an idea

of a supreme being which rests on a quite different

use of reason the practical use lies in us fundamentally

a priori impelling us to supplement by the

concept of a deity the defective representation

supplied by a physical teleology of the original

ground of the purposes in nature and we should

not falsely imagine that we had worked out this

idea and with it a theology by means of the

theoretical use of reason in the physical cognition

of the worldmuch less that we had proved its

reality
one cannot blame the ancients much if they

thought of their gods as differing much from each

other both as regards their faculties and as regards

their designs and volitions but yet thought of all

of them the supreme one not excepted as always

limited after human fashion for if they considered

the arrangement and the course of things in nature

they certainly found ground enough for assuming

something more than mechanism as its cause and

for conjecturing behind the machinery of this world

designs of certain higher causes which they could

not think otherwise than superhuman but because

they met with good and evil the purposive and

the unpurposive mingled together at least as far

as our insight goes and could not permit themselves

to assume nevertheless that wise and benevolent

purposes of which they saw no proof lay hidden

at bottom on behalf of the arbitrary idea of a

supremely perfect original author their judgement

upon the supreme world cause could hardly have

been other than it was so long as they proceeded366

consistently according to maxims of the mere

theoretical use of reason others who wished

to be theologians as well as physicists thought to

find contentment for the reason by providing for

the absolute unity of the principle of natural things

which reason demands the idea of a being of

which as sole substance the things would be

all only inherent determinations this substance

would not be cause of the world by means of

intelligence but in it all the intelligences of the

beings in the world would be comprised this

being consequently would produce nothing according

to purposes but in it all things on account

of the unity of the subject of which they are mere

determinations must necessarily relate themselves

purposively to one another though without purpose

and design thus they introduced the idealism of

final causes by changing the unity so difficult to

explain of a number of purposively combined

substances from being the unity of causal dependence

on one substance to be the unity of inherence

in one this systemwhich in the sequel considered

on the side of the inherent world beings

becomes pantheism and later on the side of the

subject subsisting by itself as original being

becomes spinozismdoes not so much resolve as

explain away into nothing the question of the first

ground of the purposiveness of nature because this

latter concept bereft of all reality must be taken

for a mere misinterpretation of a universal ontological

concept of a thing in general
hence the concept of a deity which would

be adequate for our teleological judging of nature

can never be derived from mere theoretical

principles of the use of reason on which physico367theology

alone is based for as one alternative

we may explain all teleology as a mere deception

of the judgement in its judging of the causal combination

of things and fly to the sole principle of a

mere mechanism of nature which merely seems to

us on account of the unity of the substance of

whose determinations nature is but the manifold

to contain a universal reference to purposes or

if instead of this idealism of final causes we

wish to remain attached to the principle of the

realism of this particular kind of causality we

may set beneath natural purposes many intelligent

original beings or only a single one but so far

as we have for the basis of this concept of realism

only empirical principles derived from the actual

purposive combination in the world we cannot on

the one hand find any remedy for the discordance

that nature presents in many examples in respect

of unity of purpose and on the other hand as to

the concept of a single intelligent cause so far as

we are authorised by mere experience we can

never draw it therefrom in a manner sufficiently

determined for any serviceable theology whatever

whether theoretical or practical
physical teleology impels us it is true to seek

a theology but it cannot produce one however

far we may investigate nature by means of experience

and in reference to the purposive combination

apparent in it call in ideas of reason which must

be theoretical for physical problems what is the

use one might well complain of placing at the basis

of all these arrangements a great understanding

incommensurable by us and supposing it to govern

the world according to design if nature does not and

cannot tell us anything of the final design for368

without this we cannot refer all these natural purposes

to any common point nor can we form any

teleological principle sufficient either for cognising

the purposes collected in a system or for forming

a concept of the supreme understanding as cause

of such a nature that could serve as a standard

for our judgement reflecting teleologically thereon

i should thus have an artistic understanding for

scattered purposes but no wisdom for a final purpose

in which final purpose nevertheless must be

contained the determining ground of the said understanding

but in the absence of a final purpose

which pure reason alone can supply because all

purposes in the world are empirically conditioned

and can contain nothing absolutely good but only

what is good for this or that regarded as a contingent

design and which alone would teach me

what properties what degree and what relation of

the supreme cause to nature i have to think in

order to judge of nature as a teleological system

how and with what right do i dare to extend at

pleasure my very limited concept of that original

understanding which i can base on my limited

knowledge of the world of the might of that

original being in actualising its ideas and of its

will to do so and complete this into the idea of

an allwise infinite being if this is to be done

theoretically it would presuppose omniscience in

me in order to see into the purposes of nature in

their whole connexion and in addition the power

of conceiving all possible plans in comparison with

which the present plan would be judged on sufficient

grounds as the best for without this complete

knowledge of the effect i can arrive at no determinate

concept of the supreme cause which can369

only be found in the concept of an intelligence

infinite in every respect ie the concept of a deity

and so i can supply no foundation for theology
hence with every possible extension of physical

teleology according to the propositions above laid

down we may say by the constitution and the

principles of our cognitive faculty we can think of

nature in its purposive arrangements which have

become known to us in no other way than as the

product of an understanding to which it is subject

but the theoretical investigation of nature can never

reveal to us whether this understanding may not

also with the whole of nature and its production

have had a final design which would not lie in the

nature of the sensible world on the contrary

with all our knowledge of nature it remains undecided

whether that supreme cause is its original

ground according to a final purpose or not rather

by means of an understanding determined by the

mere necessity of its nature to produce certain forms

according to the analogy of what we call the artinstinct

in animals without it being necessary to

ascribe to it even wisdom much less the highest

wisdom combined with all other properties requisite

for the perfection of its product
hence physicotheology is a misunderstood

physical teleology only serviceable as a preparation

propaedeutic for theology and it is only

adequate to this design by the aid of a foreign

principle on which it can rely and not in itself

as its name would intimate
370
 86 of ethicotheology
the commonest understanding if it thinks over

the presence of things in the world and the existence

of the world itself cannot forbear from the judgement

that all the various creatures no matter how great

the art displayed in their arrangement and how

various their purposive mutual connexioneven

the complex of their numerous systems which we

incorrectly call worldswould be for nothing if

there were not also men rational beings in general

without men the whole creation would be a mere

waste in vain and without final purpose but

it is not in reference to mans cognitive faculty

theoretical reason that the being of everything

else in the world gets its worth he is not there

merely that there may be some one to contemplate

the world for if the contemplation of the world

only afforded a representation of things without

any final purpose no worth could accrue to its

being from the mere fact that it is known we

must presuppose for it a final purpose in reference

to which its contemplation itself has worth again

it is not in reference to the feeling of pleasure or

to the sum of pleasures that we think a final purpose

of creation as given ie we do not estimate that

absolute worth by wellbeing or by enjoyment

whether bodily or mental or in a word by happiness

for the fact that man if he exists takes

this for his final design gives us no concept as to

why in general he should exist and as to what

worth he has in himself to make his existence

pleasant he must therefore be supposed to be

the final purpose of creation in order to have a371

rational ground for holding that nature must

harmonise with his happiness if it is considered

as an absolute whole according to principles of

purposeshence there remains only the

faculty of desire not however that which makes

man dependent through sensuous impulses upon

nature nor that in respect of which the worth

of his being depends upon what he receives and

enjoys but the worth which he alone can give

to himself and which consists in what he does

how and according to what principles he acts

and that not as a link in natures chain but in the

freedom of his faculty of desireie a good willis

that whereby alone his being can have an absolute

worth and in reference to which the being of the

world can have a final purpose
the commonest judgement of healthy human

reason completely accords with this that it is

only as a moral being that man can be a final

purpose of creation if we but direct mens attention

to the question and incite them to investigate it

what does it avail one will say that this man

has so much talent that he is so active therewith

and that he exerts thereby a useful influence over

the community thus having a great worth both

in relation to his own happy condition and to the

benefit of others if he does not possess a good

will he is a contemptible object considered in

respect of his inner self and if the creation is

not to be without any final purpose at all he who

as man belongs to it must in a world under moral

laws inasmuch as he is a bad man forfeit his subjective

purpose happiness this is the only

condition under which his existence can accord with

the final purpose
372

if now we meet with purposive arrangements

in the world and as reason inevitably requires

subordinate the purposes that are only conditioned

to an unconditioned supreme ie final purpose

then we easily see in the first place that we are

thus concerned not with a purpose of nature

internal to itself so far as it exists but with

the purpose of its existence along with all its

ordinances and consequently with the ultimate

purpose of creation and specially with the supreme

condition under which can be posited a final purpose

ie the ground which determines a supreme understanding

to produce the beings of the world
since now it is only as a moral being that

we recognise man as the purpose of creation we

have in the first place a ground at least the

chief condition for regarding the world as a

whole connected according to purposes and as

a system of final causes and more especially as

regards the reference necessary for us by the

constitution of our reason of natural purposes to

an intelligent world cause we have one principle

enabling us to think the nature and properties of

this first cause as supreme ground in the kingdom

of purposes and to determine its concept this

physical teleology could not do it could only

lead to indeterminate concepts thereof unserviceable

alike in theoretical and in practical use
from the principle thus determined of the

causality of the original being we must not think

him merely as intelligence and as legislative for

nature but also as legislating supremely in a moral

kingdom of purposes in reference to the highest

good alone possible under his sovereignty viz the

existence of rational beings under moral laws we373

shall think this original being as allknowing thus

our inmost dispositions which constitute the proper

moral worth of the actions of rational beings of the

world will not be hid from him we shall think

him as allmighty thus he will be able to make

the whole of nature accord with this highest

purpose we shall think him as allgood and at

the same time as just because these two properties

which when united constitute wisdom are the

conditions of the causality of a supreme cause of

the world as highest good under moral laws so

also all the other transcendental properties such

as eternity omnipresence etc for goodness and

justice are moral properties132 which are presupposed

in reference to such a final purpose must be thought

in himin this way moral teleology supplies the

deficiency in physical teleology and first establishes

a theology because the latter if it did not borrow

from the former without being observed but were

to proceed consistently could only found a demonology

which is incapable of any definite concept
but the principle of the reference of the world

to a supreme cause as deity on account of the

moral purposive destination of certain beings in

it does not accomplish this by completing the

physicoteleological ground of proof and so taking

this necessarily as its basis it is sufficient in itself

and directs attention to the purposes of nature and

the investigation of that incomprehensible great art

lying hidden behind its forms in order to confirm

incidentally by means of natural purposes the ideas

that pure practical reason furnishes for the

concept of beings of the world under moral laws

is a principle a priori according to which man must374

of necessity judge himself further if there is

in general a world cause acting designedly and

directed towards a purpose this moral relation must

be just as necessarily the condition of the possibility

of a creation as that in accordance with physical

laws if that is this intelligent cause has also a

final purpose this is regarded a priori by

reason as a necessary fundamental proposition for

it in its teleological judging of the existence of

things it now only comes to this whether we

have sufficient ground for reason either speculative

or practical to ascribe to the supreme cause

acting in accordance with purposes a final purpose

for it may a priori be taken by us as certain

that this by the subjective constitution of our

reason and even of the reason of other beings

as far as we can think it can be nothing else than

man under moral laws since otherwise the purposes

of nature in the physical order could not be

known a priori especially as it can in no way

be seen that nature could not exist without such

purposes
remark
suppose the case of a man at the moment when

his mind is disposed to a moral sensation if surrounded

by the beauties of nature he is in a state of

restful serene enjoyment of his being he feels a

want viz to be grateful for this to some being or

other or if another time he finds himself in the

same state of mind when pressed by duties that

he can and will only adequately discharge by a

voluntary sacrifice he again feels in himself a want

viz to have thus executed a command and obeyed

a supreme lord or again if he has in some375

heedless way transgressed his duty but without

becoming answerable to men his severe selfreproach

will speak to him with the voice of a judge

to whom he has to give account in a word he

needs a moral intelligence in order to have a being

for the purpose of his existence which may be

conformably to this purpose the cause of himself

and of the world it is vain to assign motives

behind these feelings for they are immediately

connected with the purest moral sentiment because

gratitude obedience and humiliation submission to

deserved chastisement are mental dispositions that

make for duty and the mind which is inclined

towards a widening of its moral sentiment here only

voluntarily conceives an object that is not in the

world in order where possible to render its duty

before such an one it is therefore at least possible

and grounded too in our moral disposition to represent

a pure moral need of the existence of a being

by which our morality gains strength or even at

least according to our representation more scope

viz a new object for its exercise that is there is

a need to assume a morallylegislating being outside

the world without any reference to theoretical

proofs still less to selfinterest from pure moral

grounds free from all foreign influence and consequently

only subjective on the mere recommendation

of a pure practical reason legislating by itself

alone and although such a mental disposition

might seldom occur or might not last long but be

transient and without permanent effect or might

even pass away without any meditation on the object

represented in such shadowy outline or without care

to bring it under clear conceptsthere is yet here

unmistakably the ground why our moral capacity376

as a subjective principle should not be contented in

its contemplation of the world with its purposiveness

by means of natural causes but should ascribe to

it a supreme cause governing nature according to

moral principlesin addition we feel ourselves

constrained by the moral law to strive for a universal

highest purpose which yet we in common

with the rest of nature are incapable of attaining

and it is only so far as we strive for it that we can

judge ourselves to be in harmony with the final

purpose of an intelligent world cause if such there

be thus is found a pure moral ground of practical

reason for assuming this cause since it can be

done without contradiction in order that we may

no more regard that effort of reason as quite idle

and so run the risk of abandoning it from weariness
with all this so much only is to be said that

though fear first produces gods demons it is

reason by means of its moral principles that can

first produce the concept of god even when as

commonly is the case one is unskilled in the

teleology of nature or is very doubtful on account of

the difficulty of adjusting by a sufficiently established

principle its mutually contradictory phenomena

also the inner moral purposive destination of mans

being supplies that in which natural knowledge is

deficient by directing us to think for the final

purpose of the being of all things for which no

other principle than an ethical one is satisfactory to

reason the supreme cause as endowed with

properties whereby it is able to subject the whole

of nature to that single design for which nature is

merely the instrumentie to think it as a deity
377
 87 of the moral proof of the being of god
there is a physical teleology which gives

sufficient ground of proof to our theoretical reflective

judgement to assume the being of an

intelligent worldcause but we find also in ourselves

and still more in the concept of a rational

being in general endowed with freedom of his

causality a moral teleology however as the

purposive reference together with its law is determined

a priori in ourselves and therefore can be

cognised as necessary this internal conformity to

law requires no intelligent cause external to us

any more than we need look to a highest understanding

as the source of the purposiveness for

every possible exercise of art that we find in the

geometrical properties of figures but this moral

teleology concerns us as beings of the world and

therefore as beings bound up with other things in

the world upon which latter whether as purposes

or as objects in respect of which we ourselves are

final purpose the same moral laws require us to

pass judgement this moral teleology then has

to do with the reference of our own causality to

purposes and even to a final purpose that we must

aim at in the world as well as with the reciprocal

reference of the world to that moral purpose and

the external possibility of its accomplishment to

which no physical teleology can lead us hence

the question necessarily arises whether it compels

our rational judgement to go beyond the world and

seek an intelligent supreme principle for that reference

of nature to the moral in us in order to

represent nature as purposive even in reference to378

our inner moral legislation and its possible accomplishment

there is therefore certainly a moral

teleology which is connected on the one hand with

the nomothetic of freedom and on the other with that

of nature just as necessarily as civil legislation is

connected with the question where the executive

authority is to be sought and in general in every

case with the question wherein reason is to

furnish a principle of the actuality of a certain

regular order of things only possible according to

ideas we shall first set forth the progress of

reason from that moral teleology and its reference

to physical to theology and then make some

observations upon the possibility and the validity of

this way of reasoning
if we assume the being of certain things or

even only certain forms of things to be contingent

and so to be possible only through something else

which is their cause we may seek for the unconditioned

ground of this causality of the supreme

and so of the conditioned either in the physical or

the teleological order either according to the nexus

effectivus or the nexus finalis that is we may

either ask what is the supreme productive cause of

these things or what is their supreme absolutely

unconditioned purpose ie the final purpose of that

cause in its production of this or all its products

generally in the second case it is plainly presupposed

that this cause is capable of representing

purposes to itself and consequently is an intelligent

being at least it must be thought as acting in

accordance with the laws of such a being
if we follow the latter order it is a fundamental

proposition to which even the commonest

human reason is compelled to give immediate379

assent that if there is to be in general a final purpose

furnished a priori by reason this can be no

other than man every rational being of the world

under moral laws133 for and so every one judges

if the world consisted of mere lifeless or even in

part of living but irrational beings its existence

would have no worth because in it there would be

no being who would have the least concept of

what worth is again if there were intelligent

beings whose reason were only able to place the

worth of the existence of things in the relation of380

nature to themselves their wellbeing but not to

furnish of itself an original worth in freedom then

there would certainly be relative purposes in the

world but no absolute final purpose because the

existence of such rational beings would be always

purposeless but the moral laws have this peculiar

characteristic that they prescribe to reason something

as a purpose without any condition and

consequently exactly as the concept of a final purpose

requires the existence of a reason that can

be for itself the supreme law in the purposive reference

in other words the existence of rational beings

under moral laws can therefore alone be thought as

the final purpose of the being of a world if on the

contrary this be not so there would be either no

purpose at all in the cause of its being or there

would be purposes but no final purpose
the moral law as the formal rational condition

of the use of our freedom obliges us by itself alone

without depending on any purpose as material

condition but it nevertheless determines for us

and indeed a priori a final purpose towards which

it obliges us to strive and this purpose is the

highest good in the world possible through freedom
the subjective condition under which man and

according to all our concepts every rational finite

being can set a final purpose before himself under

the above law is happiness consequently the

highest physical good possible in the world to be

furthered as a final purpose as far as in us lies is

happiness under the objective condition of the

harmony of man with the law of morality as worthiness

to be happy
but it is impossible for us in accordance with

all our rational faculties to represent these two381

requirements of the final purpose proposed to us

by the moral law as connected by merely natural

causes and yet as conformable to the idea of that

final purpose hence the concept of the practical

necessity of such a purpose through the application

of our powers does not harmonise with the

theoretical concept of the physical possibility of

working it out if we connect with our freedom no

other causality as a means than that of nature
consequently we must assume a moral worldcause

an author of the world in order to set

before ourselves a final purpose consistently with

the moral law and in so far as the latter is

necessary so far ie in the same degree and on the

same ground the former also must be necessarily

assumed ie we must admit that there is a god134
this proof to which we can easily give the form

of logical precision does not say it is as necessary

to assume the being of god as to recognise the

validity of the moral law and consequently he who

cannot convince himself of the first can judge

himself free from the obligations of the second

no there must in such case only be given up the

aiming at the final purpose in the world to be

brought about by the pursuit of the second viz a

happiness of rational beings in harmony with the

pursuit of moral laws regarded as the highest382

good every rational being would yet have to

cognise himself as straitly bound by the precepts

of morality for its laws are formal and command

unconditionally without respect to purposes as the

matter of volition but the one requisite of the

final purpose as practical reason prescribes it to

beings of the world is an irresistible purpose

imposed on them by their nature as finite beings

which reason wishes to know as subject only to

the moral law as inviolable condition or even as

universally set up in accordance with it thus

reason takes for final purpose the furthering of

happiness in harmony with morality to further

this so far as is in our power ie in respect of

happiness is commanded us by the moral law be

the issue of this endeavour what it may the

fulfilling of duty consists in the form of the earnest

will not in the intermediate causes of success
suppose then that partly through the weakness

of all the speculative arguments so highly extolled

and partly through many irregularities in nature and

the world of sense which come before him a man

is persuaded of the proposition there is no god

he would nevertheless be contemptible in his own

eyes if on that account he were to imagine the

laws of duty as empty invalid and inobligatory

and wished to resolve to transgress them boldly

such an one even if he could be convinced in the

sequel of that which he had doubted at the first

would always be contemptible while having such a

disposition although he should fulfil his duty as

regards its external effect as punctiliously as could

be desired for he would be acting from fear or

from the aim at recompense without the sentiment

of reverence for duty if conversely as a believer383

in god he performs his duty according to his

conscience uprightly and disinterestedly and nevertheless

believes that he is free from all moral

obligation so soon as he is convinced that there

is no god this could accord but badly with an

inner moral disposition
we may then suppose the case of a righteous

man eg spinoza135 who holds himself firmly

persuaded that there is no god and also because

in respect of the object of morality a similar

consequence results no future life how is he to

judge of his own inner purposive destination by

means of the moral law which he reveres in

practice he desires no advantage to himself

from following it either in this or another world

he wishes rather disinterestedly to establish the

good to which that holy law directs all his powers

but his effort is bounded and from nature although

he may expect here and there a contingent accordance

he can never expect a regular harmony

agreeing according to constant rules such as his

maxims are and must be internally with the purpose

that he yet feels himself obliged and impelled to

accomplish deceit violence and envy will always

surround him although he himself be honest

peaceable and kindly and the righteous men with

whom he meets will notwithstanding all their

worthiness of happiness be yet subjected by nature

which regards not this to all the evils of want

disease and untimely death just like the beasts of

the earth so it will be until one wide grave

engulfs them together honest or not it makes no

difference and throws them backwho were able

to believe themselves the final purpose of creationinto384

the abyss of the purposeless chaos of matter

from which they were drawn the purpose then

which this wellintentioned person had and ought to

have before him in his pursuit of moral laws he

must certainly give up as impossible or else if he

wishes to remain dependent upon the call of his

moral internal destination and not to weaken the

respect with which the moral law immediately

inspires him by assuming the nothingness of the

single ideal final purpose adequate to its high

demand which cannot be brought about without

a violation of moral sentiment he must as he

well cansince there is at least no contradiction

from a practical point of view in forming a concept

of the possibility of a morally prescribed final purposeassume

the being of a moral author of the

world that is a god
 88 limitation of the validity of the moral proof
pure reason as a practical faculty ie as

the faculty of determining the free use of our

causality by ideas pure rational concepts not only

comprises in the moral law a regulative principle of

our actions but supplies us at the same time with a

subjective constitutive principle in the concept of

an object which reason alone can think and which

is to be actualised by our actions in the world

according to that law the idea of a final purpose

in the employment of freedom according to moral

laws has therefore subjective practical reality we

are a priori determined by reason to promote with

all our powers the summum bonum weltbeste

which consists in the combination of the greatest

welfare of rational beings with the highest condition385

of the good in itself ie in universal happiness

conjoined with morality most accordant to law

in this final purpose the possibility of one part

happiness is empirically conditioned ie dependent

on the constitution of nature which may or may

not agree with this purpose and is in a theoretical

aspect problematical whilst the other part morality

in respect of which we are free from the effects of

nature stands fast a priori as to its possibility and

is dogmatically certain it is then requisite for the

objective theoretical reality of the concept of the

final purpose of rational beings that we should not

only have a priori presupposed a final purpose for

ourselves but also that the creation ie the world

itself should have as regards its existence a final

purpose which if it could be proved a priori would

add objectivity to the subjective reality of the final

purpose of rational beings for if the creation has

on the whole a final purpose we cannot think it

otherwise than as harmonising with the moral purpose

which alone makes the concept of a purpose

possible now we find without doubt purposes in

the world and physical teleology exhibits them in

such abundance that if we judge in accordance with

reason we have ground for assuming as a principle

in the investigation of nature that nothing in nature

is without a purpose but the final purpose of nature

we seek there in vain this can and must therefore

as its idea only lies in reason be sought as regards

its objective possibility only in rational beings and

the practical reason of these latter not only supplies

this final purpose it also determines this concept in

respect of the conditions under which alone a final

purpose of creation can be thought by us
the question is now whether the objective386

reality of the concept of a final purpose of creation

cannot be exhibited adequately to the theoretical

requirements of pure reasonif not apodictically

for the determinant judgement yet adequately for

the maxims of the theoretical reflective judgement

this is the least one could expect from theoretical

philosophy which undertakes to combine the moral

purpose with natural purposes by means of the idea

of one single purpose but yet this little is far more

than it can accomplish
according to the principle of the theoretical reflective

judgement we should say if we have ground

for assuming for the purposive products of nature a

supreme cause of naturewhose causality in respect

of the actuality of creation is of a different kind from

that required for the mechanism of nature ie must

be thought as the causality of an understandingwe

have also sufficient ground for thinking in this

original being not merely the purposes everywhere

in nature but also a final purpose this is not

indeed a final purpose by which we can explain the

presence of such a being but one of which we

may at least convince ourselves as was the case in

physical teleology that we can make the possibility

of such a world conceivable not merely according to

purposes but only through the fact that we ascribe

to its existence a final purpose
but a final purpose is merely a concept of our

practical reason and can be inferred from no data

of experience for the theoretical judging of nature

nor can it be applied to the cognition of nature

no use of this concept is possible except its use for

practical reason according to moral laws and the

final purpose of creation is that constitution of the

world which harmonises with that which alone we387

can put forward definitely according to laws viz the

final purpose of our pure practical reason in so far

as it is to be practical now we have in the moral

law which enjoins on us in a practical point of view

the application of our powers to the accomplishment

of this final purpose a ground for assuming its

possibility and practicability and consequently too

because without the concurrence of nature with

a condition not in our power its accomplishment

would be impossible a nature of things harmonious

with it hence we have a moral ground for thinking

in a world also a final purpose of creation
we have not yet advanced from moral teleology

to a theology ie to the being of a moral author

of the world but only to a final purpose of creation

which is determined in this way but in order to

account for this creation ie the existence of things

in accordance with a final purpose we must assume

not only first an intelligent being for the possibility

of things of nature which we are compelled to judge

of as purposes but also a moral being as author of

the world ie a god this second conclusion is of

such a character that we see it holds merely for

the judgement according to concepts of practical

reason and as such for the reflective and not the

determinant judgement it is true that in us morally

practical reason is essentially different in its principles

from technically practical reason but we

cannot assume that it must be so likewise in the

supreme worldcause regarded as intelligence

and that a peculiar mode of its causality is requisite

for the final purpose different from that which is

requisite merely for purposes of nature we cannot

therefore assume that in our final purpose we have

not merely a moral ground for admitting a final388

purpose of creation as an effect but also for admitting

a moral being as the original ground of creation

but we may well say that according to the constitution

of our rational faculty we cannot comprehend

the possibility of such a purposiveness in respect of

the moral law and its object as there is in this final

purpose apart from an author and governor of the

world who is at the same time its moral lawgiver
the actuality of a highest morallylegislating

author is therefore sufficiently established merely

for the practical use of our reason without determining

anything theoretically as regards its being

for reason requires in respect of the possibility of

its purpose which is given to us independently by

its own legislation an idea through which the

inability to follow up this purpose according to

the mere natural concepts of the world is removed

sufficiently for the reflective judgement thus

this idea gains practical reality although all means

of creating such for it in a theoretical point of view

for the explanation of nature and determination of the

supreme cause are entirely wanting for speculative

cognition for the theoretical reflective judgement

physical teleology sufficiently proves from the purposes

of nature an intelligent worldcause for the

practical judgement moral teleology establishes it

by the concept of a final purpose which it is forced

to ascribe to creation in a practical point of view

the objective reality of the idea of god as moral

author of the world cannot it is true be established

by physical purposes alone but nevertheless if the

cognition of these purposes is combined with that

of the moral purpose they are by virtue of the

maxim of pure reason which bids us seek unity

of principles so far as is possible of great importance389

for the practical reality of that idea by bringing

in the reality which it has for the judgement in a

theoretical point of view
to prevent a misunderstanding which may easily

arise it is in the highest degree needful to remark

that in the first place we can think these properties

of the highest being only according to analogy

how indeed could we explore the nature of that

to which experience can show us nothing similar

secondly in this way we only think the supreme

being we cannot thereby cognise him and ascribe

anything theoretically to him it would be needful

for the determinant judgement in the speculative

aspect of our reason to consider what the supreme

worldcause is in himself but here we are only

concerned with the question what concept we can

form of him according to the constitution of our

cognitive faculties and whether we have to assume

his existence in order merely to furnish practical

reality to a purpose which pure reason without

any such presupposition enjoins upon us a priori

to bring about with all our powers ie in order

to be able to think as possible a designed effect

although that concept may be transcendent for

the speculative reason and the properties which

we ascribe to the being thereby thought may

objectively used conceal an anthropomorphism in

themselves yet the design of its use is not to

determine the nature of that being which is unattainable

by us but to determine ourselves and our

will accordingly we may call a cause after the

concept which we have of its effect though only in

reference to this relation without thereby meaning

to determine internally its inner constitution by

means of the properties which can be made known390

to us solely by similar causes and must be given in

experience for example amongst other properties

we ascribe to the soul a vis locomotiva because

bodily movements actually arise whose cause lies in

the representation of them without therefore meaning

to ascribe to it the only mode of action that we

know in moving forces viz by attraction pressure

impulse and consequently motion which always

presuppose an extended being just so we must

assume something which contains the ground of the

possibility and practical reality ie the practicability

of a necessary moral final purpose but we can think

of this in accordance with the character of the effect

expected of it as a wise being governing the world

according to moral laws and conformably to the

constitution of our cognitive faculties as a cause of

things distinct from nature only in order to express

the relation of this being which transcends all our

cognitive faculties to the objects of our practical

reason we do not pretend thus to ascribe to it

theoretically the only causality of this kind known to

us viz an understanding and a will we do not

even pretend to distinguish objectively the causality

thought in this being as regards what is for us

final purpose from the causality thought in it as

regards nature and its purposive determinations in

general we can only assume this distinction as

subjectively necessary by the constitution of our

cognitive faculties and as valid for the reflective not

for the objectively determinant judgement but if we

come to practice then such a regulative principle of

prudence or wisdom commanding us to act conformably

to that as purpose which by the constitution

of our cognitive faculties can only be thought as

possible in a certain way is at the same constitutive391
ie practically determinant nevertheless as a

principle for judging of the objective possibility of

things it is no way theoretically determinant ie it

does not say that the only kind of possibility which

belongs to the object is that which belongs to our

thinking faculty but is a mere regulative principle

for the reflective judgement
remark
this moral proof is not one newly discovered

although perhaps its basis is newly set forth since

it has lain in mans rational faculty from its earliest

germ and is only continually developed with its

advancing cultivation so soon as men begin to

reflect upon right and wrongat a time when quite

indifferent as to the purposiveness of nature they

avail themselves of it without thinking anything

more of it than that it is the accustomed course of

naturethis judgement is inevitable viz that the

issue cannot be the same whether a man has

behaved candidly or falsely fairly or violently

even though up to his lifes end as far as can be

seen he has met with no happiness for his virtues

no punishment for his vices it is as if they perceived

a voice within saying that the issue must

be different and so there must lie hidden in

them a representation however obscure of something

after which they feel themselves bound to

strive with which such a result would not agreewith

which if they looked upon the course of the

world as the only order of things they could not

harmonise that inner purposive determination of

their minds now they might represent in various

rude fashions the way in which such an irregularity392

could be adjusted an irregularity which must be

far more revolting to the human mind than the

blind chance that we are sometimes willing to use as

a principle for judging of nature but they could

never think any other principle of the possibility of

the unification of nature with its inner ethical laws

than a supreme cause governing the world according

to moral laws because a final purpose in them

proposed as duty and a nature without any final

purpose beyond them in which that purpose might

be actualised would involve a contradiction as to

the inner136 constitution of that worldcause they

could contrive much nonsense but that moral

relation in the government of the world would

remain always the same which by the uncultivated

reason considered as practical is universally

comprehensible but with which the speculative

reason can make far from the like advanceand

in all probability attention would be directed

first by this moral interest to the beauty and the

purposes in nature which would serve excellently

to strengthen this idea though they could not be

the foundation of it still less could that moral

interest be dispensed with because it is only in

reference to the final purpose that the investigation

of the purposes of nature acquires that immediate

interest which displays itself in such a

great degree in the admiration of them without any

reference to the advantage to be derived from them
 89 of the use of the moral argument
the limitation of reason in respect of all our

ideas of the supersensible to the conditions of its393

practical employment has as far as the idea of god

is concerned undeniable uses for it prevents

theology from rising into theosophy into transcendent

concepts which confound reason or from

sinking into demonology an anthropomorphic way

of representing the highest being and it also

prevents religion from turning into theurgy a

fanatical belief that we can have a feeling of other

supersensible beings and can reciprocally influence

them or into idolatry a superstitious belief that

we can please the supreme being by other means

than by a moral sentiment137
for if we permit the vanity or the presumption

of sophistry to determine the least thing theoretically

in a way that extends our knowledge in respect

of what lies beyond the world of sense or if we

allow any pretence to be made of insight into the

being and constitution of the nature of god of

his understanding and will of the laws of both

and of his properties which thus affect the world

i should like to know where and at what point

we will bound these assumptions of reason for

wherever such insight can be derived there may

yet more be expected if we only strain our reflection

as we have a mind to do bounds must then be

put to such claims according to a certain principle

and not merely because we find that all attempts

of the sort have hitherto failed for that proves

nothing against the possibility of a better result394

but here no principle is possible except either to

assume that in respect of the supersensible absolutely

nothing can be theoretically determined except

mere negations or else that our reason contains

in itself a yet unused mine of cognitions reaching

no one knows how far stored up for ourselves and

our posteritybut as concerns religion ie

morals in reference to god as legislator if the

theoretical cognition of him is to come first morals

must be adjusted in accordance with theology

and not only is an external arbitrary legislation

of a supreme being introduced in place of an

internal necessary legislation of reason but also

whatever is defective in our insight into the nature

of this being must extend to ethical precepts and

thus make religion immoral and perverted
as regards the hope of a future life if instead of

the final purpose we have to accomplish in conformity

with the precept of the moral law we ask

of our theoretical faculty of cognition a clue for the

judgement of reason upon our destination which

clue is only considered as necessary or worthy of

acceptance in a practical reference then in this

aspect psychology like theology gives no more

than a negative concept of our thinking being

that is none of its actions or of the phenomena

of the internal sense can be explained materialistically

and hence of its separate nature and of the

continuance or noncontinuance of its personality

after death absolutely no ampliative determinant

judgement is possible on speculative grounds by

means of our whole theoretical cognitive faculty

here then everything is handed over to the

teleological judging of our existence in a practically

necessary aspect and to the assumption of our395

continuance as a condition requisite for the final

purpose absolutely furnished by reason and so

this advantage which indeed at first glance seems

to be a loss is apparent that as theology for

us can never be theosophy or rational psychology

become pneumatologyan ampliative scienceso

on the other hand this latter is assured of never

falling into materialism psychology rather is a

mere anthropology of the internal sense ie is the

knowledge of our thinking self in life and as

theoretical cognition remains merely empirical

on the other hand rational psychology as far as

it is concerned with questions as to our eternal

existence is not a theoretical science at all but

rests on a single conclusion of moral teleology

as also its whole use is necessary merely on account

of the latter ie on account of our practical

destination
 90 of the kind of belief in a teleological proof

of the being of god
the first requisite for every proof whether it

be derived from the immediate empirical presentation

as in the proof from observation of the object

or from experiment of that which is to be proved

or by reason a priori from principles is this it

should not persuade but convince138 or at least should

tend to conviction ie the ground of proof or

the conclusion should not be merely a subjective

aesthetical determining ground of assent mere

illusion but objectively valid and a logical ground396

of cognition for otherwise the understanding is

ensnared but not convinced such an illusory

proof is that which perhaps with good intent but

yet with wilful concealment of its weaknesses is

adduced in natural theology in this we bring

in the great number of indications of the origin

of natural things according to the principle of

purposes and take advantage of the merely

subjective basis of human reason viz its special

propensity to think only one principle instead of

several whenever this can be done without contradiction

and when in this principle only one

or more requisites for determining a concept are

furnished to add in our thought these additional

features so as to complete the concept of the

thing by arbitrarily supplementing it for in truth

when we meet with so many products in nature

which are to us marks of an intelligent cause why

should we not think one cause rather than many

and in this one not merely great intelligence

power etc but rather omniscience and omnipotencein

a word think it as a cause that contains

the sufficient ground of such properties in

all possible things further why should we not

ascribe to this unique allpowerful original being

not only intelligence for natural laws and products

but also as to a moral cause of the world supreme

ethical practical reason for by this completion

of the concept a sufficient principle is furnished

both for insight into nature and for moral wisdom

and no objection grounded in any way can be made

against the possibility of such an idea if now

at the same time the moral motives of the mind are

aroused and a lively interest in the latter is added

by the force of eloquence of which they are indeed397

very worthy then there arises therefrom a persuasion

of the objective adequacy of the proof and

also in most cases of its use a wholesome illusion

which quite dispenses with all examination of its

logical strictness and even on the contrary regards

this with abhorrence and dislike as if an impious

doubt lay at its basisnow against this there

is indeed nothing to say so long as we only

have regard to its popular usefulness but then

the division of the proof into the two dissimilar

parts involved in the argumentbelonging to

physical and moral teleology respectivelycannot

and must not be prevented for the blending

of these makes it impossible to discern where the

proper force of the proof lies and in what part

and how it must be elaborated in order that its

validity may be able to stand the strictest examination

even if we should be compelled to

admit in one part the weakness of our rational

insight thus it is the duty of the philosopher

supposing even that he counts as nothing the claims

of sincerity to expose the above illusion however

wholesome it is which such a confusion can produce

and to distinguish what merely belongs to persuasion

from that which leads to conviction for these are

determinations of assent which differ not merely

in degree but in kind in order to present plainly

the state of the mind in this proof in its whole

clearness and to be able to subject it frankly to

the closest examination
but a proof which is intended to convince can

again be of two kinds either deciding what the

object is in itself or what it is for us for men in

general according to our necessary rational principles

of judgement proof   or  398

the last word being taken in its universal signification

of man in general in the first case it is based

on adequate principles for the determinant judgement

in the second for the reflective judgement in

the latter case it can never when resting on merely

theoretical principles tend to conviction but if

a practical principle of reason which is therefore

universally and necessarily valid lies at its basis

it may certainly lay claim to conviction adequate

in a pure practical point of view ie to moral

conviction but a proof tends to conviction though

without convincing if it is merely139 brought on the

way thereto ie if it contains in itself only objective

grounds which although not attaining to certainty are

yet of such a kind that they do not serve merely for

persuasion as subjective grounds of the judgement140
all theoretical grounds of proof resolve themselves

either into 1 proofs by logically strict

syllogisms of reason or where this is not the case

2 conclusions according to analogy or where this

also has no place 3 probable opinion or finally

which has the least weight 4 assumption of a

merely possible ground of explanation ie hypothesisnow

i say that all grounds of proof in

general which aim at theoretical conviction can

bring about no belief of this kind from the highest

to the lowest degree if there is to be proved the

proposition of the existence of an original being as

a god in the signification adequate to the whole

content of this concept viz a moral author of the

world by whom the final purpose of creation is at

the same time supplied
399

1 as to the logically accurate proof proceeding

from universal to particular we have sufficiently established

in the critique the following since no intuition

possible for us corresponds to the concept of

a being that is to be sought beyond naturewhose

concept therefore so far as it is to be theoretically

determined by synthetical predicates remains always

problematical for usthere is absolutely no cognition

of it to be had by which the extent of our theoretical

knowledge is in the least enlarged the particular

concept of a supersensible being cannot be subsumed

under the universal principles of the nature of things

in order to conclude from them to it because those

principles are valid simply for nature as an object

of sense
2 we can indeed think one of two dissimilar

things even in the very point of their dissimilarity

in accordance with the analogy141 of the other but400

we cannot from that wherein they are dissimilar

conclude from the one to the other by analogy ie

transfer from the one to the other this sign of

specific distinction thus i can according to the

analogy of the law of the equality of action and

reaction in the mutual attraction and repulsion of

bodies also conceive of the association of the

members of a commonwealth according to rules of

right but i cannot transfer to it those specific

determinations material attraction or repulsion and

ascribe them to the citizens in order to constitute a

system called a statejust so we can indeed

conceive of the causality of the original being in

respect of the things of the world as natural

purposes according to the analogy of an understanding

as ground of the forms of certain products

which we call works of art for this only takes place

on behalf of the theoretical or practical use that

we have to make by our cognitive faculty of this

concept in respect of the natural things in the world

according to a certain principle but we can in

no way conclude according to analogy because in

the case of beings of the world understanding must401

be ascribed to the cause of an effect which is judged

artificial that in respect of nature the same causality

which we perceive in men attaches also to the being

which is quite distinct from nature for this concerns

the very point of dissimilarity which is thought

between a cause sensibly conditioned in respect of

its effects and the supersensible original being itself

in our concept of it and which therefore cannot be

transferred from one to the other in the very

fact that i must conceive the divine causality only

according to the analogy of an understanding which

faculty we know in no other being than in sensiblyconditioned

man lies the prohibition to ascribe to

it this understanding in its peculiar signification142
3 opinion finds in a priori judgements no

place whatever for by them we either cognise

something as quite certain or else cognise nothing

at all but if the given grounds of proof from

which we start as here from the purposes in the

world are empirical then we cannot even with

their aid form any opinion as to anything beyond

the world of sense nor can we concede to such

venturesome judgements the smallest claim to

probability for probability is part of a certainty

possible in a certain series of grounds its grounds

compare with the sufficient ground as parts with

a whole the insufficient ground of which must be

susceptible of completion but since as determining

grounds of one and the same judgement they

must be of the same kind for otherwise they would

not together constitute a whole such as certainty

is one part of them cannot lie within the bounds402

of possible experience and another outside all

possible experience consequently since merely

empirical grounds of proof lead to nothing supersensible

and since what is lacking in the series of

them cannot in any way be completed we do not

approach in the least nearer in our attempt to attain

by their means to the supersensible and to a

cognition thereof thus in any judgement about

the latter by means of arguments derived from

experience probability has no place
4 if an hypothesis is to serve for the explanation

of the possibility of a given phenomenon at

least its possibility must be completely certain143 it

is sufficient that in an hypothesis i disclaim any

cognition of actuality which is claimed in an

opinion given out as probable more than this i

cannot give up the possibility of that which i

place at the basis of my explanation must at least

be exposed to no doubt otherwise there would be

no end of empty chimeras but to assume the

possibility of a supersensible being determined

according to certain concepts would be a completely

groundless supposition for here none of the conditions

requisite for cognition as regards that in it

which rests upon intuition is given and so the sole

criterion of possibility remaining is the mere principle

of contradiction which can only prove the possibility

of the thought not of the object thought
the result then is this for the existence

dasein of the original being as a godhead or of

the soul as an immortal spirit absolutely no proof

in a theoretical point of view is possible for the403

human reason which can bring about even the

least degree of belief the ground of this is quite

easy to comprehend for determining our ideas

of the supersensible we have no material whatever

and we must derive this latter from things in the

world of sense which is absolutely inadequate for

such an object thus in the absence of all determination

of it nothing remains but the concept of

a nonsensible something which contains the ultimate

ground of the world of sense but which does not

furnish any knowledge any amplification of the

concept of its inner constitution
 91 of the kind of belief produced by a practical

faith
if we look merely to the way in which anything

can be for us according to the subjective constitution

of our representative powers an object of

knowledge res cognoscibilis then our concepts will

not cohere with objects but merely with our cognitive

faculties and the use which they can make of

a given representation in a theoretical or practical

point of view thus the question whether anything

is or is not a cognisable being is not a question

concerning the possibility of things but of our

knowledge of them
cognisable things are of three kinds things of

opinion opinabile things of fact scibile and things

of faith mere credibile
1 objects of mere rational ideas which for

theoretical knowledge cannot be presented in any

possible experience are so far not cognisable things

and consequently in respect of them we can form no

opinion for to form an opinion a priori is absurd404

in itself and the straight road to mere chimeras

either then our proposition is certain a priori or it

contains nothing for belief therefore things of

opinion are always objects of an empirical cognition

at least possible in itself objects of the world of

sense but which on account merely of the low

degree of this faculty that we possess is for us

impossible thus the ether of the new physicists144

an elastic fluid pervading all other matter mingled

intimately with it is a mere thing of opinion yet is

such that if our external senses were sharpened to

the highest degree it could be perceived though it

can never be presented in any observation or experiment

to assume the existence of rational

inhabitants of other planets is a thing of opinion

for if we could come closer to them which is in

itself possible we should decide by experience

whether they did or did not exist but as we shall

never come so near it remains in the region of

opinion but to hold the opinion that there are in

the material universe pure thinking spirits without

bodies viz if we dismiss as unworthy of our notice

certain phenomena which have been published as

actual145 is to be called poetic fiction this is no

thing of opinion but a mere idea which remains405

over when we remove from a thinking being everything

material and only leave thought to it

whether then the latter which we know only in

man that is in combination with a body does

survive we cannot decide such a thing is a

sophistical being ens rationis ratiocinantis not a

rational being ens rationis ratiocinatae146 of which

latter it is possible to show conclusively the

objective reality of its concept at least for the

practical use of reason because this which has its

peculiar and apodictically certain principles a priori

demands postulates it
2 objects for concepts whose objective reality

can be proved whether through pure reason or

through experience and in the first case from its

theoretical or practical data in all cases by means of

a corresponding intuition are things of fact res

facti147 of this kind are the mathematical properties

of magnitudes in geometry because they are susceptible

of a presentation a priori for the theoretical

use of reason further things or their characteristics

which can be exhibited in experience

either our own or that of others through the

medium of testimony are likewise things of factand

what is very remarkable there is one rational

idea susceptible in itself of no presentation406

in intuition and consequently of no theoretical

proof of its possibility which also comes under

things of fact this is the idea of freedom whose

reality regarded as that of a particular kind of

causality of which the concept theoretically considered

would be transcendent may be exhibited

by means of practical laws of pure reason and

conformably to this in actual actions and consequently

in experiencethis is the only one

of all the ideas of pure reason whose object is a

thing of fact and to be reckoned under the scibilia
3 objects which in reference to the use of

pure practical reason that is in conformity with

duty must be thought a priori whether as consequences

or as grounds but which are transcendent

for its theoretical use are mere things of faith of

this kind is the highest good in the world to be

brought about by freedom148 the concept of this

cannot be established as regards its objective reality

in any experience possible for us and thus adequately

for the theoretical use of reason but its use is

commanded by practical pure reason in reference

to the best possible working out of that purpose149

and it consequently must be assumed possible this

commanded effect together with the only conditions

of its possibility thinkable by us viz the being of

god and the immortality of the soul are things of

faith res fidei and of all objects are the only ones

which can be so called150 for though what we learn407

by testimony from the experience of others must be

believed by us yet it is not therefore a thing of

faith for it was the proper experience of some one

witness and so a thing of fact or is presupposed as

such again it must be possible by this path that

of historical faith to arrive at knowledge and the

objects of history and geography like everything

in general which it is at least possible to know by

the constitution of our cognitive faculties belong

not to things of faith but to things of fact it is

only objects of pure reason which can be things of

faith at all though not as objects of the mere pure

speculative reason for then they could not be

reckoned with certainty among things ie objects

of that cognition which is possible for us they are

ideas ie concepts of the objective reality of which

we cannot theoretically be certain on the other

hand the highest final purpose to be worked out by

us by which alone we can become worthy of being

ourselves the final purpose of creation is an idea

which has in a practical reference objective reality

for us and is also a thing but because we cannot

furnish such reality to this concept in a theoretical

point of view it is a mere thing of faith of the pure

reason along with god and immortality as the

conditions under which alone we in accordance with

the constitution of our human reason can conceive

the possibility of that effect of the use of our freedom

in conformity with law but belief in things of faith

is a belief in a pure practical point of view ie a

moral faith which proves nothing for theoretical pure

rational cognition but only for that which is practical

and directed to the fulfilment of its duties it in no

way extends speculation or the practical rules of

prudence in accordance with the principle of self408love

if the supreme principle of all moral laws is

a postulate so is also the possibility of its highest

object and consequently too the condition under

which we can think this possibility is postulated

along with it and by it thus the cognition of

the latter is neither knowledge nor opinion of the

being and character of these conditions regarded as

theoretical cognition but is a mere assumption in

a reference which is practical and commanded for

the moral use of our reason
if we were able also plausibly to base upon the

purposes of nature which physical teleology presents

to us in such rich abundance a determinate

concept of an intelligent worldcause then the

existence dasein of this being would not be

a thing of faith for since this would not be

assumed on behalf of the performance of my duty

but only in reference to the explanation of nature

it would be merely the opinion and hypothesis most

conformable to our reason now such teleology

leads in no way to a determinate concept of god

on the contrary this can only be found in the concept

of a moral author of the world because this

alone furnishes the final purpose to which we can

only reckon ourselves as attached if we behave conformably

to what the moral law prescribes as final

purpose and consequently obliges us to do hence

it is only by its reference to the object of our duty as

the condition of the possibility of attaining the final

purpose of the same that the concept of god attains

the privilege of counting as a thing of faith in our

belief but on the other hand this same concept

cannot make its object valid as a thing of fact

for although the necessity of duty is very plain

for practical reason yet the attainment of its final409

purpose so far as it is not altogether in our own

power is only assumed on behalf of the practical

use of reason and therefore is not so practically

necessary as duty itself151
faith as habitus not as actus is the moral

attitude of reason as to belief in that which is unattainable

by theoretical cognition it is therefore

the constant principle of the mind to assume as true

on account of the obligation in reference to it that

which it is necessary to presuppose as condition of

the possibility of the highest moral final purpose152410

although its possibility or impossibility be alike

impossible for us to see into faith absolutely so

called is trust in the attainment of a design the

promotion of which is a duty but the possibility of

the fulfilment of which and consequently also that

of the only conditions of it thinkable by us is not to

be comprehended by us faith then that refers to

particular objects which are not objects of possible

knowledge or opinion in which latter case it ought

to be called especially in historical matters credulity

and not faith is quite moral it is a free belief not

in that for which dogmatical proofs for the theoretically

determinant judgement are to be found or in

that to which we hold ourselves bound but in that

which we assume on behalf of a design in accordance

with laws of freedom this however is not

like opinion without any adequate ground but is

grounded as in reason although only in respect of

its practical employment and adequately for its

design for without this the moral attitude of

thought in its repudiation of the claim of the theoretical

reason for proofs of the possibility of the

objects of morality has no permanence but

wavers between practical commands and theoretical411

doubts to be incredulous means to cling to

maxims and not to believe testimony in general

but he is unbelieving who denies all validity to

rational ideas because there is wanting a theoretical

ground of their reality154 he judges therefore dogmatically

a dogmatical unbelief cannot subsist

together with a moral maxim dominant in the

mental attitude for reason cannot command one to

follow a purpose which is cognised as nothing more

than a chimera but a doubtful faith can to this

the absence of conviction by grounds of speculative

reason is only a hindrance the influence of which

upon conduct a critical insight into the limits of

this faculty can remove while it substitutes by way

of compensation a paramount practical belief
    
if in place of certain mistaken attempts we

wish to introduce a different principle into philosophy

and to promote its influence it makes us

highly contented to see how and why those attempts

must have disappointed us
god freedom and immortality are the problems

at the solution of which all the equipments of metaphysic

aim as their ultimate and unique purpose

now it was believed that the doctrine of freedom is

needed for practical philosophy only as its negative

condition but that on the other hand the doctrine

of god and of the constitution of the soul as belonging

to theoretical philosophy must be established for

themselves and separately in order afterwards to

unite both with that which the moral law possible

only under the condition of freedom commands412

and so to constitute a religion but we can easily

see that these attempts must fail for from mere

ontological concepts of things in general or of the

existence of a necessary being it is possible to

form absolutely no determinate concept of an

original being by means of predicates which can

be given in experience and can therefore serve for

cognition again a concept based on experience

of the physical purposiveness of nature could furnish

no adequate proof for morality or consequently for

cognition of a deity just as little could the cognition

of the soul by means of experience which we

only apply in this life supply us with a concept of

its spiritual immortal nature a concept which would

be adequate for morality theology and pneumatology

regarded as problems of the sciences of a

speculative reason can be established by no

empirical data and predicates because the concept

of them is transcendent for our whole cognitive

facultythe determination of both concepts

god and the soul in respect of its immortality

alike can only take place by means of predicates

which although they are only possible from a supersensible

ground must yet prove their reality in

experience for thus alone can they make possible

a cognition of a quite supersensible beingthe

only concept of this kind to be met with in human

reason is that of the freedom of men under moral

laws along with the final purpose which reason

prescribes by these laws of these two the moral

laws and the final purpose the first are useful for

ascribing to the author of nature the second for

ascribing to man those properties which contain the

necessary condition of the possibility of both god

and the soul so that from this idea a conclusion413

can be drawn as to the existence and constitution

of these beings which are otherwise quite hidden

from us
thus the ground of the failure of the attempt

to prove god and immortality by the merely

theoretical path lies in this that no cognition

whatever is possible of the supersensible in this

way of natural concepts the ground of its

success by the moral way of the concept of

freedom is as follows here the supersensible

freedom which in this case is fundamental by

a determinate law of causality that springs from

it not only supplies material for cognition of other

supersensibles the moral final purpose and the

conditions of its attainability but also establishes

its reality in actions as a fact though at the same

time it can furnish a valid ground of proof in no

other than a practical point of view the only one

however of which religion has need
it is thus very remarkable that of the three pure

rational ideas god freedom and immortality that

of freedom is the only concept of the supersensible

which by means of the causality that is thought in

it proves its objective reality in nature by means of

the effects it can produce there and thus renders

possible the connexion of both the others with

nature and of all three together with religion

we have therefore in us a principle capable of

determining the idea of the supersensible within

us and thus also that of the supersensible without

us for knowledge although only in a practical

point of view a principle this of which mere

speculative philosophy which could give a merely

negative concept of freedom must despair consequently

the concept of freedom as fundamental414

concept of all unconditioned practical laws can

extend reason beyond those bounds within which

every natural theoretical concept must remain

hopelessly limited
 general remark on teleology
if the question is what rank the moral argument

which proves the being of god only as a thing of

faith for the practical pure reason maintains among

the other arguments in philosophy it is easy to set

aside the whole achievement of this last by which

it appears that there is no choice but that our

theoretical faculty must give up all its pretensions

before an impartial criticism
all belief must in the first place be grounded

upon facts if it is not to be completely groundless

and therefore the only distinction in proofs that

there can be is that belief in the consequence derived

therefrom can either be grounded on this fact as

knowledge for theoretical cognition or merely as

faith for practical all facts belong either to the

natural concept which proves its reality in the

objects of sense given or which may possibly be

given before all natural concepts or to the concept

of freedom which sufficiently establishes its reality

through the causality of reason in regard of certain

effects in the world of sense possible through it

which it incontrovertibly postulates in the moral law

the natural concept merely belonging to theoretical

cognition is now either metaphysical and thinkable

completely a priori or physical ie thinkable a

posteriori and as necessary only through determinate

experience the metaphysical natural concept415

which presupposes no determinate experience is

therefore ontological
the ontological proof of the being of god from

the concept of an original being is either that

which from ontological predicates by which alone it

can be thought as completely determined infers

absolutely necessary being or that which from the

absolute necessity of the being somewhere of some

thing whatever it be infers the predicates of the

original being for there belongs to the concept

of an original being inasmuch as it is not derived

from anything the unconditioned necessity of its

presence and in order to represent this its complete

determination by its mere155 concept it was

believed that both requirements were found in the

concept of the ontological idea of a being the most

real of all and thus two metaphysical proofs

originated
the proof properly called ontological resting

upon a merely metaphysical natural concept concludes

from the concept of the being the most real

of all its absolutely necessary existence for it is

said if it did not exist a reality would be wanting

to it viz existencethe other which is also

called the metaphysicocosmological proof concludes

from the necessity of the existence somewhere of a

thing which must be conceded for a being is

given to us in selfconsciousness its complete

determination as that of a being the most real of

all for everything existing must be completely

determined but the absolutely necessary ie that

which we ought to cognise as such and consequently

a priori must be completely determined by

means of its own concept but this is only the case416

with the concept of a thing the most real of all

it is not needful to expose here the sophistry in

both arguments which has been already done elsewhere156

it is only needful to remark that neither

proof even if they could be defended by all

manner of dialectical subtlety could ever pass from

the schools into the world or have the slightest

influence on the mere sound understanding
the proof which rests on a natural concept

that can only be empirical and yet is to lead us

beyond the bounds of nature regarded as the

complex of the objects of sense can be no other

than that derived from the purposes of nature the

concept of these cannot it is true be given a priori

but only through experience but yet it promises

such a concept of the original ground of nature as

alone among all those which we can conceive is

suited to the supersensible viz that of a highest

understanding as cause of the world this in fact

it completely performs in accordance with principles

of the reflective judgement ie in accordance with

the constitution of our human faculty of cognitionbut

whether or not it is in a position to

supply from the same data this concept of a supreme

ie independent intelligent being in short of a god

or author of a world under moral laws and consequently

as sufficiently determined for the idea of a

final purpose of the being of the worldthis is the

question upon which everything depends whether

we desire a theoretically adequate concept of the

original being on behalf of our whole knowledge of

nature or a practical concept for religion
this argument derived from physical teleology

is worthy of respect it produces a similar effect417

in the way of conviction upon the common understanding

as upon the subtlest thinker and a

reimarus157 has acquired immortal honour in his

work not yet superseded in which he abundantly

develops this ground of proof with his peculiar

thoroughness and luciditybut how does this

proof acquire such mighty influence upon the mind

how does a judgement by cold reason for we

might refer to persuasion the emotion and elevation

of reason produced by the wonders of nature issue

thus in a calm and unreserved assent it is not the

physical purposes which all indicate in the world

cause an unfathomable intelligence these are inadequate

thereto because they do not satisfy the

need of the inquiring reason for wherefore it

asks are all those natural things that exhibit art

wherefore is man himself whom we must regard as

the ultimate purpose of nature thinkable by us

wherefore is this collective nature here and what

is the final purpose of such great and manifold art

reason cannot be contented with enjoyment or with

contemplation observation and admiration which if

it stops there is only enjoyment of a particular kind

as the ultimate final purpose for the creation of the

world and of man himself for this presupposes a

personal worth which man alone can give himself

as the condition under which alone he and his being

can be the final purpose failing this which alone

is susceptible of a definite concept the purposes of

nature do not satisfactorily answer our questions

especially because they cannot furnish any determinate418

concept of the highest being as an allsufficient

and therefore unique and so properly

called highest being and of the laws according to

which an understanding is cause of the world
hence that the physicoteleological proof convinces

just as if it were a theological proof does

not arise from our availing ourselves of the ideas of

purposes of nature as so many empirical grounds of

proof of a highest understanding but it mingles

itself unnoticed with that moral ground of proof

which dwells in every man and influences him

secretly in the conclusion by which we ascribe to

the being which manifests itself with such incomprehensible

art in the purposes of nature a final

purpose and consequently wisdom without however

being justified in doing so by the perception of the

former and by which therefore we arbitrarily fill

up the lacunas of the design argument in fact it

is only the moral ground of proof which produces

conviction and that only in a moral reference with

which every man feels inwardly his agreement

but the physicoteleological proof has only the

merit of leading the mind in its consideration of the

world by the way of purposes and through them to

an intelligent author of the world the moral

reference to purposes and the idea of a moral legislator

and author of the world as a theological

concept seem to be developed of themselves out of

that ground of proof although they are in truth pure

additions
henceforward we may allow the customary

statement to stand for it is generally difficult if

the distinction requires much reflection for ordinary

sound understanding to distinguish from one

another as heterogeneous the different principles419

which it confuses and from one of which alone it

actually draws conclusions with correctness the

moral ground of proof of the being of god properly

speaking does not merely complete and render

perfect the physicoteleological proof but it is a

special proof that supplies the conviction which is

wanting in the latter this latter in fact can do

nothing more than guide reason in its judgements

upon the ground of nature and that contingent but

admirable order of nature only known to us by

experience to the causality of a cause containing

the ground of the same in accordance with purposes

which we by the constitution of our cognitive

faculties must think as an intelligent cause and

thus by arresting the attention of reason it makes

it more susceptible of the moral proof for what

is requisite to the latter concept is so essentially

different from everything which natural concepts

contain and can teach that there is need of a

particular ground of proof quite independent of

the former in order to supply the concept of the

original being adequately for theology and to

infer its existencethe moral proof which it

is true only proves the being of god in a practical

though indispensable aspect of reason would preserve

all its force if we found in the world no

material or only that which is doubtful for physical

teleology it is possible to conceive rational beings

surrounded by a nature which displayed no clear

trace of organisation but only the effects of a mere

mechanism of crude matter on behalf of which and

amid the changeability of some merely contingent

purposive forms and relations there would appear

to be no ground for inferring an intelligent author

in such case there would be no occasion for a420

physical teleology and yet reason which here

gets no guidance from natural concepts would

find in the concept of freedom and in the moral

ideas founded thereon a practically sufficient ground

for postulating the concept of the original being

in conformity with these ie as a deity and for

postulating nature even the nature of our own

being as a final purpose in accordance with freedom

and its lawsand all this in reference to the indispensable

command of practical reasonhowever

the fact that there is in the actual world for

the rational beings in it abundant material for

physical teleology even though this is not necessary

serves as a desirable confirmation of the

moral argument as far as nature can exhibit anything

analogous to the moral rational ideas for

the concept of a supreme cause possessing intelligence

though not reaching far enough for a

theology thus acquires sufficient reality for the

reflective judgement but it is not required as the

basis of the moral proof nor does this latter serve

to complete as a proof the former which does not

by itself point to morality at all by means of an

argument developed according to a single principle

two such heterogeneous principles as nature and

freedom can only furnish two different kinds of

proof and the attempt to derive one from the

other is found unavailing as regards that which is

to be proved
if the physicoteleological ground of proof

sufficed for the proof which is sought it would

be very satisfactory for the speculative reason

for it would furnish the hope of founding a theosophy

for so we must call the theoretical cognition

of the divine nature and its existence which would421

suffice at once for the explanation of the constitution

of the world and for the determination of moral laws

in the same way if psychology enabled us to arrive

at a cognition of the immortality of the soul it would

make pneumatology possible which would be just

as welcome to the speculative reason but neither

agreeable as they would be to the arrogance of our

curiosity would satisfy the wish of reason in respect

of a theory which must be based on a cognition of

the nature of things whether the first as theology

and the second as anthropology when founded on

the moral principle ie the principle of freedom and

consequently in accordance with the practical use of

reason do not better fulfil their objective final design

is another question which we need not here pursue
the physicoteleological ground of proof does

not reach to theology because it does not and

cannot give any determinate concept sufficient

for this design of the original being but we must

derive this from quite another quarter or must

supply its lacuna by an arbitrary addition you

infer from the great purposiveness of natural forms

and their relations a worldcause endowed with

understanding but what is the degree of this

understanding without doubt you cannot assume

that it is the highest possible understanding because

for that it would be requisite that you should

see that a greater understanding than that of which

you perceive proofs in the world is not thinkable

and this would be to ascribe omniscience to yourself158

in the same way if you infer from the magnitude

of the world the very great might of its author422

you must be content with this having only a comparative

significance for your faculty of comprehension

for since you do not know all that is possible

so as to compare it with the magnitude of the world

as far as you know it you cannot infer the almightiness

of its author from so small a standard and so on

now you arrive in this way at no definite concept

of an original being available for a theology for

this can only be found in the concept of the totality

of perfections compatible with intelligence and you

cannot help yourself to this by merely empirical data

but without such a definite concept you cannot infer

a unique intelligent original being you can only

assume it with whatever motivenow it may

certainly be conceded that you should arbitrarily

add for reason has nothing fundamental to say

to the contrary where so much perfection is

found we may well assume that all perfection is

united in a unique cause of the world because

reason succeeds better both theoretically and practically

with a principle thus definite but then

you cannot regard this concept of the original being

as proved by you for you have only assumed it on

behalf of a better employment of reason hence

all lamentation or impotent anger on account of

the alleged mischief of rendering doubtful the

coherency of your chain of reasoning is vain pretentiousness

which would fain have us believe that

the doubt here freely expressed as to your argument

is a doubting of sacred truth in order that under

this cover the shallowness of your argument may

pass unnoticed
moral teleology on the other hand which is

not less firmly based than physicalwhich indeed

rather deserves the preference because it rests423
a priori on principles inseparable from our reasonleads

to that which is requisite for the possibility

of a theology viz to a determinate concept of the

supreme cause as cause of the world according

to moral laws and consequently to the concept

of such a cause as satisfies our moral final purpose

for this are required as natural properties belonging

to it nothing less than omniscience omnipotence

omnipresence and the like which must be

thought as bound up with the moral final purpose

which is infinite and thus as adequate to it hence

moral teleology alone can furnish the concept of

a unique author of the world which is available

for a theology
in this way theology leads immediately to

religion ie the recognition of our duties as divine

commands159 because it is only the recognition of

our duty and of the final purpose enjoined upon

us by reason which brings out with definiteness

the concept of god this concept therefore is

inseparable in its origin from obligation to that

being on the other hand even if the concept

of the original being could be also found determinately

by the merely theoretical path viz the

concept of it as mere cause of nature it would

afterwards be very difficultperhaps impossible

without arbitrary interpolation of elementsto

ascribe to this being by wellgrounded proofs

a causality in accordance with moral laws and

yet without this that quasitheological concept

could furnish no foundation for religion even if

a religion could be established by this theoretical

path it would actually as regards sentiment

wherein its essence lies be different from that in424

which the concept of god and the practical

conviction of his being originate from the fundamental

ideas of morality for if we must suppose

the omnipotence omniscience etc of an author

of the world as concepts given to us from another

quarter in order afterwards only to apply our

concepts of duties to our relation to him then

these latter concepts must bear very markedly the

appearance of compulsion and forced submission

if instead of this the respect for the moral law

quite freely in virtue of the precept of our own

reason represents to us the final purpose of our

destination we admit among our moral views a

cause harmonising with this and with its accomplishment

with the sincerest reverence which is quite

distinct from pathological fear and we willingly

submit ourselves thereto160
if it be asked why it is incumbent upon us to

have any theology at all it appears clear that

it is not needed for the extension or correction of

our cognition of nature or in general for any theory

but simply in a subjective point of view for religion

ie the practical or moral use of our reason if

it is found that the only argument which leads to

a definite concept of the object of theology is itself

moral it is not only not strange but we miss

nothing in respect of its final purpose as regards425

the sufficiency of belief from this ground of proof

provided that it be admitted that such an argument

only establishes the being of god sufficiently for

our moral destination ie in a practical point of

view and that here speculation neither shows its

strength in any way nor extends by means of it

the sphere of its domain our surprise and the

alleged contradiction between the possibility of a

theology asserted here and that which the critique

of speculative reason said of the categoriesviz

that they can only produce knowledge when applied

to objects of sense but in no way when applied

to the supersensiblevanish if we see that they

are here used for a cognition of god not in a

theoretical point of view in accordance with what

his own nature inscrutable to us may be but

simply in a practicalin order then at this

opportunity to make an end of the misinterpretation

of that very necessary doctrine of the critique

which to the chagrin of the blind dogmatist refers

reason to its bounds i add here the following

elucidation
if i ascribe to a body motive force and thus

think it by means of the category of causality

then i at the same time cognise it by that category

ie i determine the concept of it as of an object in

general by means of what belongs to it by itself

as the condition of the possibility of that relation

as an object of sense if the motive force ascribed

to it is repulsive then there belongs to it although

i do not place near it any other body upon which

it may exert force a place in space and moreover

extension ie space in itself besides the filling

up of this by means of the repulsive forces of

its parts in addition there is the law of this426

filling up that the ground of the repulsion of the

parts must decrease in the same proportion as the

extension of the body increases and as the space

which it fills with the same parts by means of this

force is augmentedon the contrary if i think

a supersensible being as the first mover and thus

by the category of causality as regards its determination

of the world motion of matter i must

not think it as existing in any place in space nor

as extended i must not even think it as existing

in time or simultaneously with other beings hence

i have no determinations whatever which could

make intelligible to me the condition of the possibility

of motion by means of this being as its

ground consequently i do not in the very least

cognise it by means of the predicate of cause as

first mover for itself but i have only the representation

of a something containing the ground

of the motions in the world and the relation of

the latter to it as their cause since it does not

besides furnish me with anything belonging to the

constitution of the thing which is cause leaves its

concept quite empty the reason of this is that

by predicates which only find their object in the

world of sense i can indeed proceed to the being of

something which must contain their ground but not

to the determination of its concept as a supersensible

being which excludes all these predicates by

the category of causality then if i determine it

by the concept of a first mover i do not in the

very least cognise what god is perhaps however

i shall have better success if i start from the

order of the world not merely to think its causality

as that of a supreme understanding but to cognise

it by means of this determination of the said concept427

because here the troublesome condition of

space and of extension disappearsat all events

the great purposiveness in the world compels us

to think a supreme cause of it and to think its

causality as that of an understanding but we are

not therefore entitled to ascribe this to it eg

we think of the eternity of god as presence in

all time because we can form no other concept

of mere being as a quantum ie as duration

or we think of the divine omnipresence as presence

in all places in order to make comprehensible to

ourselves his immediate presence in things which

are external to one another without daring to ascribe

to god any of these determinations as something

cognised in him if i determine the causality of

a man in respect of certain products which are

only explicable by designed purposiveness by thinking

it as that of understanding i need not stop

here but i can ascribe to him this predicate as a

wellknown property and cognise him accordingly

for i know that intuitions are given to the senses

of men and are brought by the understanding

under a concept and thus under a rule that this

concept only contains the common characteristic

with omission of the particular ones and is thus

discursive and that the rules for bringing given

representations under a consciousness in general

are given by understanding before those intuitions

etc i therefore ascribe this property to man as a

property by means of which i cognise him however

if i wish to think a supersensible being god

as an intelligence this is not only permissible in a

certain aspect of my employment of reasonit is

unavoidable but to ascribe to him understanding

and to flatter ourselves that we can cognise him by428

means of it as a property of his is in no way permissible

for i must omit all those conditions

under which alone i know an understanding and

thus the predicate which only serves for determining

man cannot be applied at all to a supersensible

object and therefore by a causality thus determined

i cannot cognise what god is and so it is

with all categories which can have no significance

for cognition in a theoretical aspect if they are not

applied to objects of possible experiencehowever

according to the analogy of an understanding

i can in a certain other aspect think a supersensible

being without at the same time meaning thereby to

cognise it theoretically viz if this determination of

its causality concerns an effect in the world which

contains a design morally necessary but unattainable

by a sensible being for then a cognition of god

and of his being theology is possible by means

of properties and determinations of his causality

merely thought in him according to analogy which

has all requisite reality in a practical reference

though only in respect of this as moralan

ethical theology is therefore possible for though

morality can subsist without theology as regards its

rule it cannot do so as regards the final design

which this proposes unless reason in respect of

it is to be renounced but a theological ethic

of pure reason is impossible for laws which

reason itself does not give and whose observance it

does not bring about as a pure practical faculty

can not be moral in the same way a theological

physic would be a nonentity for it would propose no

laws of nature but ordinances of a highest will

while on the other hand a physical properly speaking

a physicoteleological theology can serve at429

least as a propaedeutic to theology proper by giving

occasion for the idea of a final purpose which

nature cannot present by the observation of natural

purposes of which it offers abundant material it

thus makes felt the need of a theology which shall

determine the concept of god adequately for the

highest practical use of reason but it cannot develop

this and base it satisfactorily on its proofs

9 if we have cause for supposing that concepts which we use as

empirical principles stand in relationship with the pure cognitive

faculty a priori it is profitable because of this reference to seek for

them a transcendental definition ie a definition through pure categories

so far as these by themselves adequately furnish the distinction

of the concept in question from others we here follow the example

of the mathematician who leaves undetermined the empirical data of

his problem and only brings their relation in their pure synthesis

under the concepts of pure arithmetic and thus generalises the solution

objection has been brought against a similar procedure of

mine cf the preface to the critique of practical reason abbotts translation

p 94 and my definition of the faculty of desire has been

found fault with viz that it is the beings faculty of becoming by

means of its representations the cause of the actuality of the objects of

these representations for the desires might be mere cravings and by

means of these alone every one is convinced the object cannot be

producedbut this proves nothing more than that there are desires

in man by which he is in contradiction with himself for here

he strives for the production of the object by means of the representation

alone from which he can expect no result because he is conscious

that his mechanical powers if i may so call those which are

not psychological which must be determined by that representation to

bring about the object mediately are either not competent or even

tend towards what is impossible eg to reverse the past o mihi

praeteritos  etc or to annihilate in the impatience of expectation

the interval before the wished for momentalthough in such

fantastic desires we are conscious of the inadequacy or even the

unsuitability of our representations for being causes of their objects

yet their reference as causes and consequently the representation of

their causality is contained in every wish and this is specially

evident if the wish is an affection or longing for these longings

by their dilatation and contraction of the heart and consequent exhaustion

of its powers prove that these powers are continually kept on

the stretch by representations but that they perpetually let the mind

having regard to the impossibility of the desire fall back in exhaustion

even prayers for the aversion of great and as far as one

can see unavoidable evils and many superstitious means for attaining

in a natural way impossible purposes point to the causal reference

of representations to their objects a reference which cannot at all be

checked by the consciousness of the inadequacy of the effort to produce

the effectas to why there should be in our nature this propensity

to desires which are consciously vain that is an anthropologicoteleological

problem it seems that if we were not determined to the

application of our powers before we were assured of the adequacy of

our faculties to produce an object these powers would remain in great

part unused for we commonly learn to know our powers only by

first making trial of them this deception in the case of vain wishes

is then only the consequence of a benevolent ordinance in our nature

this note was added by kant in the second edition

10 one of the various pretended contradictions in this whole

distinction of the causality of nature from that of freedom is this

it is objected that if i speak of obstacles which nature opposes to

causality according to moral laws of freedom or of the assistance it

affords i am admitting an influence of the former upon the latter

but if we try to understand what has been said this misinterpretation

is very easy to avoid the opposition or assistance is not

between nature and freedom but between the former as phenomenon

and the effects of the latter as phenomena in the world of sense

the causality of freedom itself of pure and practical reason is the

causality of a natural cause subordinated to freedom ie of the

subject considered as man and therefore as phenomenon the

intelligible which is thought under freedom contains the ground of

the determination of this natural cause in a way not explicable any

further just as that intelligible does which constitutes the supersensible

substrate of nature

11 it has been thought a doubtful point that my divisions in pure

philosophy should always be threefold but that lies in the nature

of the thing if there is to be an a priori division it must be either

analytical according to the law of contradiction which is always

twofold quodlibet ens est aut a aut non a or it is synthetical

and if in this latter case it is to be derived from a priori concepts

not as in mathematic from the intuition corresponding to the

concept the division must necessarily be trichotomy for according

to what is requisite for synthetical unity in general there must be

1 a condition 2 a conditioned and 3 the concept which arises

from the union of the conditioned with its condition

12 the definition of taste which is laid down here is that it is the

faculty of judging of the beautiful but the analysis of judgements of

taste must show what is required in order to call an object beautiful

the moments to which this judgement has regard in its reflection i

have sought in accordance with the guidance of the logical functions

of judgement for in a judgement of taste a reference to the understanding

is always involved i have considered the moment of

quality first because the aesthetical judgement upon the beautiful first

pays attention to it

13 a judgement upon an object of satisfaction may be quite disinterested

but yet very interesting ie not based upon an interest but

bringing an interest with it of this kind are all pure moral judgements

judgements of taste however do not in themselves establish

any interest only in society is it interesting to have taste the

reason of this will be shown in the sequel

14 second edition

15 an obligation to enjoyment is a manifest absurdity thus the

obligation to all actions which have merely enjoyment for their aim

can only be a pretended one however spiritually it may be conceived

or decked out even if it is a mystical or socalled heavenly

enjoyment

18 ueberweg points out hist of phil ii 528 eng trans that

mendelssohn had already called attention to the disinterestedness of

our satisfaction in the beautiful it appears says mendelssohn

to be a particular mark of the beautiful that it is contemplated with

quiet satisfaction that it pleases even though it be not in our

possession and even though we be never so far removed from the

desire to put it to our use but of course as ueberweg remarks

kants conception of disinterestedness extends far beyond the absence

of a desire to possess the object

which therefore is at bottom not a pleasure in the existence of the

object of the representation but clings to the representation only

may be called mere contemplative pleasure or passive satisfaction

word perfection is liable to many misconceptions it is sometimes

understood as a concept belonging to transcendental philosophy

viz the concept of the totality of the manifold which taken together

constitutes a thing sometimes again it is understood as belonging

to teleology so that it signifies the agreement of the characteristics

of a thing with a purpose perfection in the former sense might be

called quantitative material in the latter qualitative formal perfection

34 models of taste as regards the arts of speech must be

composed in a dead and learned language the first in order

that they may not suffer that change which inevitably comes over

living languages in which noble expressions become flat common

ones antiquated and newly created ones have only a short currency

the second because learned languages have a grammar which is subject

to no wanton change of fashion but the rules of which are

preserved unchanged

35 this distinction between an idea and an ideal as also the

further contrast between ideals of the reason and ideals of the

imagination had already been given by kant in the critique of

pure reason dialectic bk ii c iii  1

36 polycletus of argos flourished about 430 bc his statue of

the spearbearer doryphorus afterwards became known as the canon

because in it the artist was supposed to have embodied a perfect

representation of the ideal of the human figure

37 this was a celebrated statue executed by myron a greek

sculptor contemporary with polycletus it is frequently mentioned

in the greek anthology

38 it will be found that a perfectly regular countenance such as a

painter might wish to have for a model ordinarily tells us nothing

because it contains nothing characteristic and therefore rather

expresses the idea of the race than the specific traits of a person

the exaggeration of a characteristic of this kind ie such as does

violence to the normal idea the purposiveness of the race is called

caricature experience also shows that these quite regular

countenances commonly indicate internally only a mediocre man

presumably if it may be assumed that external nature expresses the

proportions of internal because if no mental disposition exceeds

that proportion which is requisite in order to constitute a man free

from faults nothing can be expected of what is called genius in

which nature seems to depart from the ordinary relations of the

mental powers on behalf of some special one

39 it might be objected to this explanation that there are things in

which we see a purposive form without cognising any definite purpose

in them like the stone implements often got from old sepulchral tumuli

with a hole in them as if for a handle these although they plainly

indicate by their shape a purposiveness of which we do not know

the purpose are nevertheless not described as beautiful but if we

regard a thing as a work of art that is enough to make us admit

that its shape has reference to some design and definite purpose

and hence there is no immediate satisfaction in the contemplation

of it on the other hand a flower eg a tulip is regarded as

beautiful because in perceiving it we find a certain purposiveness

which in our judgement is referred to no purpose at all

55 affections are specifically different from passions the former

are related merely to feeling the latter belong to the faculty of

desire and are inclinations which render difficult or impossible all

determination of the elective will by principles the former are

stormy and unpremeditated the latter are steady and deliberate

thus indignation in the form of wrath is an affection but in the form

of hatred revenge is a passion the latter can never and in no

reference be called sublime because while in an affection the

freedom of the mind is hindered in a passion it is abolished cf

preface to the metaphysical elements of ethics  xvi where this

distinction is more fully drawn out affection is described as hasty

and passion is defined as the sensible appetite grown into a permanent

inclination

56 in the preface to the metaphysical elements of ethics  xvii

kant gives the term moral apathy to that freedom from the sway of

the affections which is distinguished from indifference to them

more plausibly than cooks or perfumers we may observe however

70 first edition has limited

71 in order to be justified in claiming universal assent for an

aesthetical judgement that rests merely on subjective grounds it is

sufficient to assume 1 that the subjective conditions of the

judgement as regards the relation of the cognitive powers thus put

into activity to a cognition in general are the same in all men

this must be true because otherwise men would not be able to

communicate their representations or even their knowledge 2

the judgement must merely have reference to this relation consequently

to the formal condition of the judgement and be pure ie

not mingled either with concepts of the object or with sensations as

determining grounds if there has been any mistake as regards

this latter condition then there is only an inaccurate application of

the privilege which a law gives us to a particular case but that

does not destroy the privilege itself in general

72 kant lays down these three maxims in his introduction to logic

 vii as general rules and conditions of the avoidance of error

73 we soon see that although enlightenment is easy in thesi yet

in hypothesi it is difficult and slow of accomplishment for not to

be passive as regards reason but to be always selflegislative is

indeed quite easy for the man who wishes only to be in accordance

with his essential purpose and does not desire to know what is

beyond his understanding but since we can hardly avoid seeking

this and there are never wanting others who promise with much

confidence that they are able to satisfy our curiosity it must be very

hard to maintain in or restore to the mind especially the mind of the

public that bare negative which properly constitutes enlightenment

74 we may designate taste as sensus communis aestheticus common

understanding as sensus communis logicus

90 ie the case of plastic art with its subdivisions of architecture

and sculpture as is explained in the next paragraph

91 that landscape gardening may be regarded as a species of

the art of painting although it presents its forms corporeally seems

strange but since it actually takes its forms from nature trees

shrubs grasses and flowers from forest and fieldat least in the first

instance and so far is not an art like plastic and since it also has

no concept of the object and its purpose as in architecture conditioning

its arrangements but involves merely the free play of the

imagination in contemplation it so far agrees with mere aesthetical

painting which has no definite theme which arranges sky land and

water so as to entertain us by means of light and shade onlyin

general the reader is only to judge of this as an attempt to combine

the beautiful arts under one principle viz that of the expression of

aesthetical ideas according to the analogy of speech and not to

regard it as a definitive analysis of them

92 i must admit that a beautiful poem has always given me a pure

gratification whilst the reading of the best discourse whether of

a roman orator or of a modern parliamentary speaker or of a

preacher has always been mingled with an unpleasant feeling of

disapprobation of a treacherous art which means to move men in

important matters like machines to a judgement that must lose all

weight for them on quiet reflection readiness and accuracy in

speaking which taken together constitute rhetoric belong to

beautiful art but the art of the orator ars oratoria the art of

availing oneself of the weaknesses of men for ones own designs

whether these be well meant or even actually good does not matter

is worthy of no respect again this art only reached its highest

point both at athens and at rome at a time when the state was

hastening to its ruin and true patriotic sentiment had disappeared

the man who along with a clear insight into things has in his power

a wealth of pure speech and who with a fruitful imagination capable

of presenting his ideas unites a lively sympathy with what is truly

good is the vir bonus discendi peritus the orator without art but of

great impressiveness as cicero has it though he may not always

remain true to this ideal

93 from this to the end of the paragraph and the next note

were added in the second edition

94 those who recommend the singing of spiritual songs at family

prayers do not consider that they inflict a great hardship upon the

public by such noisy and therefore in general pharisaical devotions

which may account for the asperity of this note at one period he

was disturbed by the devotional exercises of the prisoners in the

adjoining jail in a letter to the burgomaster he suggested the

advantage of closing the windows during these hymnsingings and

added that the warders of the prison might probably be directed to

accept less sonorous and neighbourannoying chants as evidence of

the penitent spirit of their captives wallaces kant p 42

99 we may describe as a rationalising judgement judicium

can serve as the major premise of a syllogism on the other hand

108 we can conversely throw light upon a certain combination

much more often met with in idea than in actuality by means of an

analogy to the socalled immediate natural purposes in a recent

complete transformation of a great people into a state the word

organisation for the regulation of magistracies etc and even of the

whole body politic has often been fitly used for in such a whole

every member should surely be purpose as well as means and whilst

all work together towards the possibility of the whole each should

be determined as regards place and function by means of the idea

of the whole kant probably alludes here to the organisation of

the united states of america

109 these words are inserted by rosenkranz and windelband but

omitted by hartenstein and kirchmann

110 in the aesthetical part  58 p 247 it was said we view beautiful

nature with favour whilst we have a quite free disinterested satisfaction

in its form for in this mere judgement of taste no consideration

is given to the purpose for which these natural beauties exist

whether to excite pleasure in us or as purposes without any reference

to us at all but in a teleological judgement we pay attention to

this reference and here we can regard it as a favour of nature that

it has been willing to minister to our culture by the exhibition of so

many beautiful figures

111 the german word vermessen is a good word and full of

meaning a judgement in which we forget to consider the extent of

our powers our understanding may sometimes sound very humble

and yet make great pretensions and so be very presumptuous of

this kind are most of those by which we pretend to extol the divine

wisdom by ascribing to it designs in the works of creation and

preservation which are really meant to do honour to the private

wisdom of the reasoner

112 we thus see that in most speculative things of pure reason

as regards dogmatic assertions the philosophical schools have

commonly tried all possible solutions of a given question to

explain the purposiveness of nature men have tried either lifeless

matter or a lifeless god or again living matter or a living god

it only remains for us if the need should arise to abandon all

these objective assertions and to examine critically our judgement

merely in reference to our cognitive faculties in order to supply to

their principle a validity which if not dogmatic shall at least be that

of a maxim sufficient for the sure employment of reason

113 that is the wider concept serves as a universal under which

the particular may be brought cognition from principles in kants

phrase is the process of knowing the particular in the universal by

means of concepts

114 this distinction will be familiar to the student of the critique of

pure reason see dialectic bk i of the concepts of pure reason

115 second edition

116 this principle that for our intellect the conception of an

organised body is impossible except by the aid of the idea of design

is frequently insisted on by kant professor wallace points out

kant p 110 that as far back as 1755 in his general physiogony

and theory of the heavens kant classed the origin of animals and

plants with the secrets of providence and the mystical number 666

as one of the topics on which ingenuity and thought are occasionally

wasted

117 second edition

118 second edition

119 this is marked as an appendix in the second edition

120 we may call a hypothesis of this kind a daring venture of

reason and there may be few even of the most acute naturalists

through whose head it has not sometimes passed for it is not

absurd like that generatio aequivoca by which is understood the

production of an organised being through the mechanics of crude

unorganised matter it would always remain generatio univoca in the

most universal sense of the word for it only considers one organic

being as derived from another organic being although from one

which is specifically different eg certain wateranimals transform

themselves gradually into marshanimals and from these after

some generations into landanimals a priori in the judgement

of reason alone there is no contradiction here only experience

gives no example of it according to experience all generation

that we know is generatio homonyma this is not merely

univoca in contrast to the generation out of unorganised material

but in the organisation the product is of like kind to that which

produced it and generation heteronyma so far as our empirical

knowledge of nature extends is nowhere found

121 it is probable that kant alludes here to humes essay on a

providence and a future state  xi of the inquiry hume argues

that though the inference from an effect to an intelligent cause may

be valid in the case of human contrivance it is not legitimate to rise

by a like argument to supreme intelligence in human nature

there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations

so that when from any fact we have discovered one intention of any

man it may often be reasonable from experience to infer another

and draw a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future

conduct but this method of reasoning can never have place with

regard to a being so remote and incomprehensible who bears much

less analogy to any other being in the universe than the sun to

a waxen taper and who discovers himself only by some faint traces

or outlines beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him

any attribute or perfection

124 if the once adopted name natural history is to continue for the

description of nature we may in contrast with art give the title of

archaeology of nature to that which the former literally indicates viz

a representation of the old condition of the earth about which

although we cannot hope for certainty we have good ground for

conjecture as sculptured stones etc belong to the province of art

so petrefactions belong to the archaeology of nature and since work

is actually being done in this science under the name of the theory

of the earth constantly although of course slowly this name is

not given to a merely imaginary investigation of nature but to one to

which nature itself leads and invites us

127 these views are set forth by kant more fully in the essay

129 cf the philosophical theory of religion part i on the bad

principle in human nature iii where kant remarks that although

war is not so incurably bad as the deadness of a universal monarchy

 yet as an ancient observed it makes more bad men than

it takes away

130 the value of life for us if it is estimated by that which we

enjoy by the natural purpose of the sum of all inclinations ie

happiness is easy to decide it sinks below zero for who would

be willing to enter upon life anew under the same conditions who

would do so even according to a new selfchosen plan yet in conformity

with the course of nature if it were merely directed to enjoyment

we have shown above what value life has in virtue of what it

contains in itself when lived in accordance with the purpose that

nature has along with us and which consists in what we do not

merely what we enjoy in which however we are always but means

towards an undetermined final purpose there remains then

nothing but the value which we ourselves give our life through what

we can not only do but do purposively in such independence of

nature that the existence of nature itself can only be a purpose

under this condition

131 it would be possible that the happiness of rational beings in

the world should be a purpose of nature and then also this would be

its ultimate purpose at least we cannot see a priori why nature

should not be so ordered because by means of its mechanism this

effect would be certainly possible at least so far as we see but

morality with a causality according to purposes subordinated thereto

is absolutely impossible by means of natural causes for the principle

by which it determines to action is supersensible and is therefore

the only possible principle in the order of purposes that in respect of

nature is absolutely unconditioned its subject consequently alone

is qualified to be the final purpose of creation to which the whole of

nature is subordinatedhappiness on the contrary as has been

shown in the preceding paragraphs by the testimony of experience

is not even a purpose of nature in respect of man in preference to

other creatures much less a final purpose of creation men may

of course make it their ultimate subjective purpose but if i ask

in reference to the final purpose of creation why must men exist

then we are speaking of an objective supreme purpose such as the

highest reason would require for creation if we answer these

beings exist to afford objects for the benevolence of that supreme

cause then we contradict the condition to which the reason of man

subjects even his inmost wish for happiness viz the harmony with

his own internal moral legislation this proves that happiness can

only be a conditioned purpose and that it is only as a moral being

that man can be the final purpose of creation but that as concerns

his state happiness is only connected with it as a consequence

according to the measure of his harmony with that purpose regarded

as the purpose of his being

132 second edition

133 i say deliberately under moral laws it is not man in

accordance with moral laws ie a being who behaves himself in

conformity with them who is the final purpose of creation for by

using the latter expression we should be asserting more than we

know viz that it is in the power of an author of the world to

cause man always to behave himself in accordance with moral

laws but this presupposes a concept of freedom and of nature of

which latter we can only think an external author which would

imply an insight into the supersensible substrate of nature and its

identity with that which causality through freedom makes possible

in the world and this far surpasses the insight of our reason

only of man under moral laws can we say without transgressing

the limits of our insight his being constitutes the final purpose of

the world this harmonises completely with the judgement of

human reason reflecting morally upon the course of the world

we believe that we perceive in the case of the wicked the traces of a

wise purposive reference if we only see that the wanton criminal does

not die before he has undergone the deserved punishment of his

misdeeds according to our concepts of free causality our good

or bad behaviour depends on ourselves we regard it the highest

wisdom in the government of the world to ordain for the first

opportunity and for both their consequence in accordance with moral

laws in the latter properly consists the glory of god which is

hence not unsuitably described by theologians as the ultimate

purpose of creation it is further to be remarked that when we

use the word creation we understand nothing more than we have

said here viz the cause of the being of the world or of the things

in it substances this is what the concept properly belonging to

this word involves actuatio substantiae est creatio and consequently

there is not implied in it the supposition of a freely

working and therefore intelligent cause whose being we first of all

want to prove

134 note added in second edition this moral argument does

not supply any objectivelyvalid proof of the being of god it does

not prove to the sceptic that there is a god but proves that if he

wishes to think in a way consonant with morality he must admit the

assumption of this proposition under the maxims of his practical

reason we should therefore not say it is necessary for morals

sittlichkeit to assume the happiness of all rational beings of the

world in proportion to their morality moralitt but rather this is

necessitated by morality accordingly this is a subjective argument

sufficient for moral beings

137 in a practical sense that religion is always idolatry which

conceives the supreme being with properties according to which

something else besides morality can be a fit condition for that which

man can do being in accordance with his will for however pure

and free from sensible images the concept that we have formed

may be in a theoretical point of view yet it will be in a practical

point of view still represented as an idol ie in regard to the character

of his will anthropomorphically

138 cf introd to logic ix p 63 conviction is opposed to persuasion

which is a belief from inadequate reasons of which we do not

139 second edition

140 ie urtheils first edition had urtheilens the judging

subject

141 analogy in a qualitative signification is the identity of the

relation between reasons and consequences causes and effects so

far as it is to be found notwithstanding the specific difference of the

things or those properties in them which contain the reason for like

consequences ie considered apart from this relation thus we

conceive of the artificial constructions of beasts by comparing them

with those of men by comparing the ground of those effects brought

about by the former which we do not know with the ground of

similar effects brought about by men reason which we do know

ie we regard the ground of the former as an analogon of reason

we then try at the same time to show that the ground of the artisan

faculty of beasts which we call instinct specifically different as it

is in fact from reason has yet a similar relation to its effect the

buildings of the beaver as compared with those of menbut then

i cannot therefore conclude that because man uses reason for

his building the beaver must have the like and call this a

conclusion according to analogy but from the similarity of the

mode of operation of beasts of which we cannot immediately

perceive the ground to that of men of which we are immediately

conscious we can quite rightly conclude according to analogy that

beasts too act in accordance with representations not as descartes

has it that they are machines and that despite their specific

distinction they are yet as living beings of the same genus as

man the principle of our right so to conclude consists in the

sameness of the ground for reckoning beasts in respect of the said

determination in the same genus with men regarded as men so far

as we can externally compare them with one another in accordance

with their actions there is par ratio just so i can conceive

according to the analogy of an understanding the causality of the

supreme worldcause by comparing its purposive products in the

world with the artificial works of men but i cannot conclude

according to analogy to those properties in it which are in man

because here the principle of the possibility of such a method of

reasoning entirely fails viz the paritas rationis for counting the

supreme being in one and the same genus with man in respect of

the causality of both the causality of the beings of the world

which is always sensibly conditioned as is causality through understanding

cannot be transferred to a being which has in common

with them no generic concept save that of thing in general

142 we thus miss nothing in the representation of the relations of

this being to the world as far as the consequences theoretical or

practical of this concept are concerned to wish to investigate

what it is in itself is a curiosity as purposeless as it is vain

145 the speculations of swedenborg seem to have always had a

strange fascination for kant he says of two reported cases of

swedenborgs clairvoyance that he knows not how to disprove them

rosenkranz vii 5 but in his anthropology  35 37 he attacks

swedenborgianism as folly so in an early essay dreams of a

visionary explained by dreams of metaphysics he avows his

scepticism as to the value of the information which psychical

research can supply about the spiritworld though he is careful not

to commit himself to any dogmatic statement on the subject of

ghosts in the critique of pure reason when discussing the

postulates of empirical thought he gives as an instance of a

concept inconsistent with the canons of possibility a power of

being in a community of thought with other men however distant

from us

146 cf supra p 229

147 i here extend correctly as it seems to me the concept of a

thing of fact beyond the usual signification of this word for it is

not needful not even feasible to limit this expression merely to

actual experience if we are talking of the relation of things to our

cognitive faculties for an experience merely possible is quite sufficient

in order that we may speak of them merely as objects of a definite

kind of cognition

150 things of faith are not therefore articles of faith if we

understand by the latter things of faith to the confession of which

internal or external we can be bound natural theology contains

nothing like this for since they as things of faith like things

of fact cannot be based on theoretical proofs they are accepted

by a belief which is free and which only as such is compatible with

the morality of the subject

151 the final purpose which the moral law enjoins upon us to

further is not the ground of duty since this lies in the moral law

which as formal practical principle leads categorically independently

of the objects of the faculty of desire the material of the will and

consequently of any purpose whatever this formal characteristic

of my actions their subordination under the principle of universal

validity wherein alone consists their inner moral worth is quite in

our power and i can quite well abstract from the possibility or the

unattainableness of purposes which i am obliged to promote in conformity

with that law because in them consists only the external

worth of my actions as something which is never completely in my

power in order only to look to that which is of my doing but then

the design of promoting the final purpose of all rational beings

happiness so far as it is possible for it to be accordant with duty

is even yet prescribed by the law of duty the speculative reason

however does not see at all the attainableness of this neither on the

side of our own physical faculty nor on that of the cooperation of

nature it must rather so far as we can judge in a rational way

hold the derivation by the aid of such causes of such a consequence

of our good conduct from mere nature internal and external without

god and immortality to be an ungrounded and vain though wellmeant

expectation and if it could have complete certainty of this

judgement it would regard the moral law itself as the mere deception

of our reason in a practical aspect but since the speculative reason

fully convinces itself that the latter can never take place but that on

the other hand those ideas whose object lies outside nature can be

thought without contradiction it must for its own practical law and the

problem prescribed thereby and therefore in a moral aspect recognise

those ideas as real in order not to come into contradiction with itself

152 it is a trust in the promise of the moral law not however

such as is contained in it but such as i put into it and that on

morally adequate grounds153 for a final purpose cannot be commanded

by any law of reason without this latter at the same time

promising however uncertainly its attainableness and thus justifying

our belief in the special conditions under which alone our reason

can think it as attainable the word fides expresses this and it can

only appear doubtful how this expression and this particular idea

came into moral philosophy since it first was introduced with

christianity and the adoption of it perhaps might seem to be only a

flattering imitation of christian terminology but this is not the only

case in which this wonderful religion with its great simplicity of statement

has enriched philosophy with far more definite and purer concepts

of morality than it had been able to furnish before but which

once they are there are freely assented to by reason and are assumed

as concepts to which it could well have come of itself and which it

could and should have introduced

preface to the first edition 1781


human reason in one sphere of its cognition is called upon to consider

questions which it cannot decline as they are presented by its own nature

but which it cannot answer as they transcend every faculty of the mind




it falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own it begins with

principles which cannot be dispensed with in the field of experience and the

truth and sufficiency of which are at the same time insured by experience

with these principles it rises in obedience to the laws of its own nature to

ever higher and more remote conditions but it quickly discovers that in this

way its labours must remain ever incomplete because new questions never cease

to present themselves and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourse to

principles which transcend the region of experience while they are regarded by

common sense without distrust it thus falls into confusion and contradictions

from which it conjectures the presence of latent errors which however it is

unable to discover because the principles it employs transcending the limits

of experience cannot be tested by that criterion the arena of these endless

contests is called metaphysic




time was when she was the queen of all the sciences and if we take

the will for the deed she certainly deserves so far as regards the high

importance of her objectmatter this title of honour now it is the fashion

of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her and the matron mourns forlorn

and forsaken like hecuba




modo maxima rerum

tot generis natisque potens

nunc trahor exul inops

ovid metamorphoses xiii




at first her government under the administration of the dogmatists

was an absolute despotism but as the legislative continued to show

traces of the ancient barbaric rule her empire gradually broke up and

intestine wars introduced the reign of anarchy while the

sceptics like nomadic tribes who hate a permanent habitation and

settled mode of living attacked from time to time those who had organized

themselves into civil communities but their number was very happily small

and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of those who

persisted in raising new edifices although on no settled or uniform plan in

recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing those disputes settled and the

legitimacy of her claims established by a kind of physiology of the

human understandingthat of the celebrated locke but it was found

thatalthough it was affirmed that this socalled queen could not refer

her descent to any higher source than that of common experience a circumstance

which necessarily brought suspicion on her claimsas this

genealogy was incorrect she persisted in the advancement of her claims

to sovereignty thus metaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and

rotten constitution of dogmatism and again became obnoxious to the

contempt from which efforts had been made to save it at present as all

methods according to the general persuasion have been tried in vain there

reigns nought but weariness and complete indifferentismthe mother

of chaos and night in the scientific world but at the same time the source of

or at least the prelude to the recreation and reinstallation of a science

when it has fallen into confusion obscurity and disuse from ill directed

effort




for it is in reality vain to profess indifference in regard to such

inquiries the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity besides

these pretended indifferentists however much they may try to disguise

themselves by the assumption of a popular style and by changes on the language

of the schools unavoidably fall into metaphysical declarations and

propositions which they profess to regard with so much contempt at the same

time this indifference which has arisen in the world of science and which

relates to that kind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the

last is a phenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection it is

plainly not the effect of the levity but of the matured judgement1

of the age which refuses to be any longer entertained with illusory knowledge

it is in fact a call to reason again to undertake the most laborious of all

tasksthat of selfexamination and to establish a tribunal which may

secure it in its wellgrounded claims while it pronounces against all baseless

assumptions and pretensions not in an arbitrary manner but according to its

own eternal and unchangeable laws this tribunal is nothing less than the

critical investigation of pure reason



 1

we very often hear complaints of the shallowness of the present age and of the

decay of profound science but i do not think that those which rest upon a

secure foundation such as mathematics physical science etc in the least

deserve this reproach but that they rather maintain their ancient fame and in

the latter case indeed far surpass it the same would be the case with the

other kinds of cognition if their principles were but firmly established in

the absence of this security indifference doubt and finally severe

criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought our age is the age

of criticism to which everything must be subjected the sacredness of

religion and the authority of legislation are by many regarded as grounds of

exemption from the examination of this tribunal but if they are exempted

they become the subjects of just suspicion and cannot lay claim to sincere

respect which reason accords only to that which has stood the test of a free

and public examination




i do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems but a critical inquiry

into the faculty of reason with reference to the cognitions to which it

strives to attain without the aid of experience in other words the

solution of the question regarding the possibility or impossibility of

metaphysics and the determination of the origin as well as of the extent and

limits of this science all this must be done on the basis of principles




this paththe only one now remaininghas been entered upon by me

and i flatter myself that i have in this way discovered the cause

ofand consequently the mode of removingall the errors which have

hitherto set reason at variance with itself in the sphere of nonempirical

thought i have not returned an evasive answer to the questions of reason by

alleging the inability and limitation of the faculties of the mind i have on

the contrary examined them completely in the light of principles and after

having discovered the cause of the doubts and contradictions into which reason

fell have solved them to its perfect satisfaction it is true these questions

have not been solved as dogmatism in its vain fancies and desires had

expected for it can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts and of

these i have no knowledge but neither do these come within the compass of our

mental powers and it was the duty of philosophy to destroy the illusions which

had their origin in misconceptions whatever darling hopes and valued

expectations may be ruined by its explanations my chief aim in this work has

been thoroughness and i make bold to say that there is not a single

metaphysical problem that does not find its solution or at least the key to

its solution here pure reason is a perfect unity and therefore if the

principle presented by it prove to be insufficient for the solution of even a

single one of those questions to which the very nature of reason gives birth

we must reject it as we could not be perfectly certain of its sufficiency in

the case of the others




while i say this i think i see upon the countenance of the reader signs of

dissatisfaction mingled with contempt when he hears declarations which sound

so boastful and extravagant and yet they are beyond comparison more moderate

than those advanced by the commonest author of the commonest philosophical

programme in which the dogmatist professes to demonstrate the simple nature of

the soul or the necessity of a primal being such a dogmatist promises to

extend human knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience while i humbly

confess that this is completely beyond my power instead of any such attempt i

confine myself to the examination of reason alone and its pure thought and i

do not need to seek far for the sumtotal of its cognition because it has its

seat in my own mind besides common logic presents me with a complete and

systematic catalogue of all the simple operations of reason and it is my task

to answer the question how far reason can go without the material presented

and the aid furnished by experience




so much for the completeness and thoroughness necessary in the execution of the

present task the aims set before us are not arbitrarily proposed but are

imposed upon us by the nature of cognition itself




the above remarks relate to the matter of our critical inquiry as

regards the form there are two indispensable conditions which any one

who undertakes so difficult a task as that of a critique of pure reason is

bound to fulfil these conditions are certitude and clearness




as regards certitude i have fully convinced myself that in this sphere

of thought opinion is perfectly inadmissible and that everything which

bears the least semblance of an hypothesis must be excluded as of no value in

such discussions for it is a necessary condition of every cognition that is to

be established upon  priori grounds that it shall be held to be

absolutely necessary much more is this the case with an attempt to determine

all pure  priori cognition and to furnish the standardand

consequently an exampleof all apodeictic philosophical certitude

whether i have succeeded in what i professed to do it is for the reader to

determine it is the authors business merely to adduce grounds and

reasons without determining what influence these ought to have on the mind of

his judges but lest anything he may have said may become the innocent cause

of doubt in their minds or tend to weaken the effect which his arguments might

otherwise producehe may be allowed to point out those passages which may

occasion mistrust or difficulty although these do not concern the main purpose

of the present work he does this solely with the view of removing from the

mind of the reader any doubts which might affect his judgement of the work as a

whole and in regard to its ultimate aim




i know no investigations more necessary for a full insight into the nature of

the faculty which we call understanding and at the same time for the

determination of the rules and limits of its use than those undertaken in the

second chapter of the transcendental analytic under the title of

deduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding and they have

also cost me by far the greatest labourlabour which i hope will not

remain uncompensated the view there taken which goes somewhat deeply into the

subject has two sides the one relates to the objects of the pure

understanding and is intended to demonstrate and to render comprehensible the

objective validity of its  priori conceptions and it forms for this

reason an essential part of the critique the other considers the pure

understanding itself its possibility and its powers of cognitionthat

is from a subjective point of view and although this exposition is of great

importance it does not belong essentially to the main purpose of the work

because the grand question is what and how much can reason and understanding

apart from experience cognize and not how is the faculty of thought

itself possible as the latter is an inquiry into the cause of a given effect

and has thus in it some semblance of an hypothesis although as i shall show

on another occasion this is really not the fact it would seem that in the

present instance i had allowed myself to enounce a mere opinion and

that the reader must therefore be at liberty to hold a different

opinion but i beg to remind him that if my subjective deduction does

not produce in his mind the conviction of its certitude at which i aimed the

objective deduction with which alone the present work is properly concerned

is in every respect satisfactory




as regards clearness the reader has a right to demand in the first

place discursive or logical clearness that is on the basis of

conceptions and secondly intuitive or sthetic clearness by means of

intuitions that is by examples or other modes of illustration in

concreto i have done what i could for the first kind of intelligibility

this was essential to my purpose and it thus became the accidental cause of my

inability to do complete justice to the second requirement i have been almost

always at a loss during the progress of this work how to settle this

question examples and illustrations always appeared to me necessary and in

the first sketch of the critique naturally fell into their proper places but

i very soon became aware of the magnitude of my task and the numerous problems

with which i should be engaged and as i perceived that this critical

investigation would even if delivered in the driest scholastic manner

be far from being brief i found it unadvisable to enlarge it still more with

examples and explanations which are necessary only from a popular point

of view i was induced to take this course from the consideration also that the

present work is not intended for popular use that those devoted to science do

not require such helps although they are always acceptable and that they

would have materially interfered with my present purpose abb terrasson

remarks with great justice that if we estimate the size of a work not from

the number of its pages but from the time which we require to make ourselves

master of it it may be said of many a bookthat it would be much

shorter if it were not so short on the other hand as regards the

comprehensibility of a system of speculative cognition connected under a

single principle we may say with equal justice many a book would have been

much clearer if it had not been intended to be so very clear for explanations

and examples and other helps to intelligibility aid us in the comprehension

of parts but they distract the attention dissipate the mental power of

the reader and stand in the way of his forming a clear conception of the

whole as he cannot attain soon enough to a survey of the system and

the colouring and embellishments bestowed upon it prevent his observing its

articulation or organizationwhich is the most important consideration

with him when he comes to judge of its unity and stability




the reader must naturally have a strong inducement to cooperate with the

present author if he has formed the intention of erecting a complete and solid

edifice of metaphysical science according to the plan now laid before him

metaphysics as here represented is the only science which admits of

completionand with little labour if it is united in a short time so

that nothing will be left to future generations except the task of illustrating

and applying it didactically for this science is nothing more than the

inventory of all that is given us by pure reason systematically

arranged nothing can escape our notice for what reason produces from itself

cannot lie concealed but must be brought to the light by reason itself so

soon as we have discovered the common principle of the ideas we seek the

perfect unity of this kind of cognitions which are based upon pure

conceptions and uninfluenced by any empirical element or any peculiar

intuition leading to determinate experience renders this completeness not only

practicable but also necessary




tecum habita et nris quam sit tibi curta supellex

persius satirae iv 52




such a system of pure speculative reason i hope to be able to publish under the

title of metaphysic of nature2 the content of this work which will not

be half so long will be very much richer than that of the present critique

which has to discover the sources of this cognition and expose the conditions

of its possibility and at the same time to clear and level a fit foundation

for the scientific edifice in the present work i look for the patient hearing

and the impartiality of a judge in the other for the goodwill and

assistance of a colabourer for however complete the list of

principles for this system may be in the critique the correctness of

the system requires that no deduced conceptions should be absent these

cannot be presented  priori but must be gradually discovered and

while the synthesis of conceptions has been fully exhausted in the

critique it is necessary that in the proposed work the same should be the

case with their analysis but this will be rather an amusement than a

labour

published




preface to the second edition 1787


whether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lies within the

province of pure reason advances with that undeviating certainty which

characterizes the progress of science we shall be at no loss to

determine if we find those who are engaged in metaphysical pursuits unable to

come to an understanding as to the method which they ought to follow if we

find them after the most elaborate preparations invariably brought to a stand

before the goal is reached and compelled to retrace their steps and strike

into fresh paths we may then feel quite sure that they are far from having

attained to the certainty of scientific progress and may rather be said to be

merely groping about in the dark in these circumstances we shall render an

important service to reason if we succeed in simply indicating the path along

which it must travel in order to arrive at any resultseven if it should

be found necessary to abandon many of those aims which without reflection

have been proposed for its attainment




that logic has advanced in this sure course even from the earliest

times is apparent from the fact that since aristotle it has been unable to

advance a step and thus to all appearance has reached its completion for if

some of the moderns have thought to enlarge its domain by introducing

psychological discussions on the mental faculties such as imagination

and wit metaphysical discussions on the origin of knowledge and the

different kinds of certitude according to the difference of the objects

idealism scepticism and so on or anthropological discussions on

prejudices their causes and remedies this attempt on the part of these

authors only shows their ignorance of the peculiar nature of logical science

we do not enlarge but disfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their

respective limits and allow them to run into one another now logic is enclosed

within limits which admit of perfectly clear definition it is a science which

has for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the formal

laws of all thought whether it be  priori or empirical whatever be

its origin or its object and whatever the difficultiesnatural or

accidentalwhich it encounters in the human mind




the early success of logic must be attributed exclusively to the narrowness of

its field in which abstraction may or rather must be made of all the objects

of cognition with their characteristic distinctions and in which the

understanding has only to deal with itself and with its own forms it is

obviously a much more difficult task for reason to strike into the sure path

of science where it has to deal not simply with itself but with objects

external to itself hence logic is properly only a

propdeuticforms as it were the vestibule of the sciences and

while it is necessary to enable us to form a correct judgement with regard to

the various branches of knowledge still the acquisition of real substantive

knowledge is to be sought only in the sciences properly so called that is in

the objective sciences




now these sciences if they can be termed rational at all must contain

elements of  priori cognition and this cognition may stand in a

twofold relation to its object either it may have to determine the

conception of the objectwhich must be supplied extraneously or it may

have to establish its reality the former is theoretical the

latter practical rational cognition in both the pure or 

priori element must be treated first and must be carefully distinguished

from that which is supplied from other sources any other method can only lead

to irremediable confusion



mathematics and physics are the two theoretical sciences which

have to determine their objects  priori the former is purely 

priori the latter is partially so but is also dependent on other sources

of cognition




in the earliest times of which history affords us any record

mathematics had already entered on the sure course of science among

that wonderful nation the greeks still it is not to be supposed that it was

as easy for this science to strike into or rather to construct for itself

that royal road as it was for logic in which reason has only to deal with

itself on the contrary i believe that it must have remained

longchiefly among the egyptiansin the stage of blind groping

after its true aims and destination and that it was revolutionized by the

happy idea of one man who struck out and determined for all time the path

which this science must follow and which admits of an indefinite advancement

the history of this intellectual revolutionmuch more important in its

results than the discovery of the passage round the celebrated cape of good

hopeand of its author has not been preserved but diogenes laertius in

naming the supposed discoverer of some of the simplest elements of geometrical

demonstrationelements which according to the ordinary opinion do not

even require to be provedmakes it apparent that the change introduced by

the first indication of this new path must have seemed of the utmost

importance to the mathematicians of that age and it has thus been secured

against the chance of oblivion a new light must have flashed on the mind of

the first man thales or whatever may have been his name who

demonstrated the properties of the isosceles triangle for he found that

it was not sufficient to meditate on the figure as it lay before his eyes or

the conception of it as it existed in his mind and thus endeavour to get at

the knowledge of its properties but that it was necessary to produce these

properties as it were by a positive  priori construction and that

in order to arrive with certainty at  priori cognition he must not

attribute to the object any other properties than those which necessarily

followed from that which he had himself in accordance with his conception

placed in the object




a much longer period elapsed before physics entered on the highway of

science for it is only about a century and a half since the wise

bacon gave a new direction to physical studies or

ratheras others were already on the right trackimparted fresh

vigour to the pursuit of this new direction here too as in the case of

mathematics we find evidence of a rapid intellectual revolution in the

remarks which follow i shall confine myself to the empirical side of

natural science




when galilei experimented with balls of a definite weight on the

inclined plane when torricelli caused the air to sustain a

weight which he had calculated beforehand to be equal to that of a definite

column of water or when stahl at a later period converted

metals into lime and reconverted lime into metal by the addition and

subtraction of certain elements3 a light broke upon all natural

philosophers they learned that reason only perceives that which it produces

after its own design that it must not be content to follow as it were in the

leadingstrings of nature but must proceed in advance with principles of

judgement according to unvarying laws and compel nature to reply its

questions for accidental observations made according to no preconceived plan

cannot be united under a necessary law but it is this that reason seeks for

and requires it is only the principles of reason which can give to concordant

phenomena the validity of laws and it is only when experiment is directed by

these rational principles that it can have any real utility reason must

approach nature with the view indeed of receiving information from it not

however in the character of a pupil who listens to all that his master

chooses to tell him but in that of a judge who compels the witnesses to reply

to those questions which he himself thinks fit to propose to this single idea

must the revolution be ascribed by which after groping in the dark for so

many centuries natural science was at length conducted into the path of

certain progress



 3 i do

not here follow with exactness the history of the experimental method of

which indeed the first steps are involved in some obscurity




we come now to metaphysics a purely speculative science which occupies

a completely isolated position and is entirely independent of the teachings of

experience it deals with mere conceptionsnot like mathematics with

conceptions applied to intuitionand in it reason is the pupil of itself

alone it is the oldest of the sciences and would still survive even if all

the rest were swallowed up in the abyss of an alldestroying barbarism but it

has not yet had the good fortune to attain to the sure scientific method this

will be apparent if we apply the tests which we proposed at the outset we

find that reason perpetually comes to a stand when it attempts to gain 

priori the perception even of those laws which the most common experience

confirms we find it compelled to retrace its steps in innumerable instances

and to abandon the path on which it had entered because this does not lead to

the desired result we find too that those who are engaged in metaphysical

pursuits are far from being able to agree among themselves but that on the

contrary this science appears to furnish an arena specially adapted for the

display of skill or the exercise of strength in mockcontestsa field in

which no combatant ever yet succeeded in gaining an inch of ground in which

at least no victory was ever yet crowned with permanent possession




this leads us to inquire why it is that in metaphysics the sure path of

science has not hitherto been found shall we suppose that it is impossible to

discover it why then should nature have visited our reason with restless

aspirations after it as if it were one of our weightiest concerns nay more

how little cause should we have to place confidence in our reason if it

abandons us in a matter about which most of all we desire to know the

truthand not only so but even allures us to the pursuit of vain

phantoms only to betray us in the end or if the path has only hitherto been

missed what indications do we possess to guide us in a renewed investigation

and to enable us to hope for greater success than has fallen to the lot of our

predecessors




it appears to me that the examples of mathematics and natural philosophy

which as we have seen were brought into their present condition by a sudden

revolution are sufficiently remarkable to fix our attention on the essential

circumstances of the change which has proved so advantageous to them and to

induce us to make the experiment of imitating them so far as the analogy

which as rational sciences they bear to metaphysics may permit it has

hitherto been assumed that our cognition must conform to the objects but all

attempts to ascertain anything about these objects  priori by means of

conceptions and thus to extend the range of our knowledge have been rendered

abortive by this assumption let us then make the experiment whether we may not

be more successful in metaphysics if we assume that the objects must conform

to our cognition this appears at all events to accord better with the

possibility of our gaining the end we have in view that is to say of

arriving at the cognition of objects  priori of determining something

with respect to these objects before they are given to us we here propose to

do just what copernicus did in attempting to explain the

celestial movements when he found that he could make no progress by assuming

that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator he reversed the

process and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved

while the stars remained at rest we may make the same experiment with regard

to the intuition of objects if the intuition must conform to the nature of the

objects i do not see how we can know anything of them  priori if on

the other hand the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition

i can then easily conceive the possibility of such an  priori

knowledge now as i cannot rest in the mere intuitions butif they are

to become cognitionsmust refer them as representations to

something as object and must determine the latter by means of the

former here again there are two courses open to me either first i

may assume that the conceptions by which i effect this determination conform

to the objectand in this case i am reduced to the same perplexity as

before or secondly i may assume that the objects or which is the

same thing that experience in which alone as given objects they are

cognized conform to my conceptionsand then i am at no loss how to

proceed for experience itself is a mode of cognition which requires

understanding before objects are given to me that is  priori i

must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding which are expressed in

conceptions  priori to these conceptions then all the objects of

experience must necessarily conform now there are objects which reason

thinks and that necessarily but which cannot be given in experience

or at least cannot be given so as reason thinks them the attempt to

think these objects will hereafter furnish an excellent test of the new method

of thought which we have adopted and which is based on the principle that we

only cognize in things  priori that which we ourselves place in them4


 4 this

method accordingly which we have borrowed from the natural philosopher

consists in seeking for the elements of pure reason in that which admits of

confirmation or refutation by experiment now the propositions of pure

reason especially when they transcend the limits of possible experience do

not admit of our making any experiment with their objects as in natural

science hence with regard to those conceptions and principles

which we assume  priori our only course will be to view them from two

different sides we must regard one and the same conception on the one

hand in relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the

understanding on the other hand in relation to reason isolated and

transcending the limits of experience as an object of mere thought now if we

find that when we regard things from this double point of view the result is

in harmony with the principle of pure reason but that when we regard them

from a single point of view reason is involved in selfcontradiction then the

experiment will establish the correctness of this distinction




this attempt succeeds as well as we could desire and promises to metaphysics

in its first partthat is where it is occupied with conceptions 

priori of which the corresponding objects may be given in

experiencethe certain course of science for by this new method we are

enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of  priori cognition and

what is more to demonstrate satisfactorily the laws which lie  priori

at the foundation of nature as the sum of the objects of

experienceneither of which was possible according to the procedure

hitherto followed but from this deduction of the faculty of  priori

cognition in the first part of metaphysics we derive a surprising result and

one which to all appearance militates against the great end of metaphysics

as treated in the second part for we come to the conclusion that our faculty

of cognition is unable to transcend the limits of possible experience and yet

this is precisely the most essential object of this science the estimate of

our rational cognition  priori at which we arrive is that it has only

to do with phenomena and that things in themselves while possessing a real

existence lie beyond its sphere here we are enabled to put the justice of

this estimate to the test for that which of necessity impels us to transcend

the limits of experience and of all phenomena is the unconditioned

which reason absolutely requires in things as they are in themselves in order

to complete the series of conditions now if it appears that when on the one

hand we assume that our cognition conforms to its objects as things in

themselves the unconditioned cannot be thought without contradiction

and that when on the other hand we assume that our representation of things

as they are given to us does not conform to these things as they are in

themselves but that these objects as phenomena conform to our mode of

representation the contradiction disappears we shall then be convinced

of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sake of experiment we

may look upon it as established that the unconditioned does not lie in things

as we know them or as they are given to us but in things as they are in

themselves beyond the range of our cognition5


 5 this

experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of the

chemists which they term the experiment of reduction or more

usually the synthetic process the analysis of the metaphysician

separates pure cognition  priori into two heterogeneous elements viz

the cognition of things as phenomena and of things in themselves

dialectic combines these again into harmony with the necessary rational

idea of the unconditioned and finds that this harmony never results except

through the above distinction which is therefore concluded to be just




but after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to make any

progress in the sphere of the supersensible it still remains for our

consideration whether data do not exist in practical cognition which may

enable us to determine the transcendent conception of the unconditioned to

rise beyond the limits of all possible experience from a practical point

of view and thus to satisfy the great ends of metaphysics speculative reason

has thus at least made room for such an extension of our knowledge and if

it must leave this space vacant still it does not rob us of the liberty to

fill it up if we can by means of practical datanay it even challenges

us to make the attempt6


 6 so

the central laws of the movements of the heavenly bodies established the truth

of that which copernicus first assumed only as a hypothesis and at the same

time brought to light that invisible force newtonian attraction which holds

the universe together the latter would have remained forever undiscovered if

copernicus had not ventured on the experimentcontrary to the senses but

still justof looking for the observed movements not in the heavenly

bodies but in the spectator in this preface i treat the new metaphysical

method as a hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts

at such a change of method which are always hypothetical but in the critique

itself it will be demonstrated not hypothetically but apodeictically from

the nature of our representations of space and time and from the elementary

conceptions of the understanding




this attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure of

metaphysics after the example of the geometricians and natural

philosophers constitutes the aim of the critique of pure speculative reason

it is a treatise on the method to be followed not a system of the science

itself but at the same time it marks out and defines both the external

boundaries and the internal structure of this science for pure speculative

reason has this peculiarity that in choosing the various objects of thought

it is able to define the limits of its own faculties and even to give a

complete enumeration of the possible modes of proposing problems to itself and

thus to sketch out the entire system of metaphysics for on the one hand in

cognition  priori nothing must be attributed to the objects but what

the thinking subject derives from itself and on the other hand reason is in

regard to the principles of cognition a perfectly distinct independent unity

in which as in an organized body every member exists for the sake of the

others and all for the sake of each so that no principle can be viewed with

safety in one relationship unless it is at the same time viewed in relation

to the total use of pure reason hence too metaphysics has this singular

advantagean advantage which falls to the lot of no other science which

has to do with objectsthat if once it is conducted into the sure

path of science by means of this criticism it can then take in the whole

sphere of its cognitions and can thus complete its work and leave it for the

use of posterity as a capital which can never receive fresh accessions for

metaphysics has to deal only with principles and with the limitations of its

own employment as determined by these principles to this perfection it is

therefore bound as the fundamental science to attain and to it the maxim

may justly be applied


 nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum




but it will be asked what kind of a treasure is this that we propose to

bequeath to posterity what is the real value of this system of metaphysics

purified by criticism and thereby reduced to a permanent condition a cursory

view of the present work will lead to the supposition that its use is merely

negative that it only serves to warn us against venturing with

speculative reason beyond the limits of experience this is in fact its

primary use but this at once assumes a positive value when we

observe that the principles with which speculative reason endeavours to

transcend its limits lead inevitably not to the extension but to the

contraction of the use of reason inasmuch as they threaten to extend

the limits of sensibility which is their proper sphere over the entire realm

of thought and thus to supplant the pure practical use of reason so far

then as this criticism is occupied in confining speculative reason within its

proper bounds it is only negative but inasmuch as it thereby at the same

time removes an obstacle which impedes and even threatens to destroy the use

of practical reason it possesses a positive and very important value in order

to admit this we have only to be convinced that there is an absolutely

necessary use of pure reasonthe moral usein which it inevitably

transcends the limits of sensibility without the aid of speculation requiring

only to be insured against the effects of a speculation which would involve it

in contradiction with itself to deny the positive advantage of the service

which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as to maintain that the

system of police is productive of no positive benefit since its main business

is to prevent the violence which citizen has to apprehend from citizen that so

each may pursue his vocation in peace and security that space and time are

only forms of sensible intuition and hence are only conditions of the

existence of things as phenomena that moreover we have no conceptions of the

understanding and consequently no elements for the cognition of things

except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given to these

conceptions that accordingly we can have no cognition of an object as a

thing in itself but only as an object of sensible intuition that is as

phenomenonall this is proved in the analytical part of the critique and

from this the limitation of all possible speculative cognition to the mere

objects of experience follows as a necessary result at the same time

it must be carefully borne in mind that while we surrender the power of

cognizing we still reserve the power of thinking objects as

things in themselves7 for otherwise we should require to

affirm the existence of an appearance without something that

appearswhich would be absurd now let us suppose for a moment that we

had not undertaken this criticism and accordingly had not drawn the necessary

distinction between things as objects of experience and things as they are in

themselves the principle of causality and by consequence the mechanism of

nature as determined by causality would then have absolute validity in

relation to all things as efficient causes i should then be unable to assert

with regard to one and the same being eg the human soul that its will is

free and yet at the same time subject to natural necessity that is

not free without falling into a palpable contradiction for in both

propositions i should take the soul in the same signification as a

thing in general as a thing in itselfas without previous criticism i

could not but take it suppose now on the other hand that we have

undertaken this criticism and have learnt that an object may be taken in

two senses first as a phenomenon secondly as a thing in itself and

that according to the deduction of the conceptions of the understanding the

principle of causality has reference only to things in the first sense we then

see how it does not involve any contradiction to assert on the one hand that

the will in the phenomenal spherein visible actionis necessarily

obedient to the law of nature and in so far not free and on the

other hand that as belonging to a thing in itself it is not subject to that

law and accordingly is free now it is true that i cannot by means

of speculative reason and still less by empirical observation cognize

my soul as a thing in itself and consequently cannot cognize liberty as the

property of a being to which i ascribe effects in the world of sense for to

do so i must cognize this being as existing and yet not in time

whichsince i cannot support my conception by any intuitionis

impossible at the same time while i cannot cognize i can quite well

think freedom that is to say my representation of it involves at least

no contradiction if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the two modes

of representation the sensible and the intellectual and the consequent

limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding and of the principles

which flow from them suppose now that morality necessarily presupposed

liberty in the strictest sense as a property of our will suppose that reason

contained certain practical original principles  priori which were

absolutely impossible without this presupposition and suppose at the same

time that speculative reason had proved that liberty was incapable of being

thought at all it would then follow that the moral presupposition must give

way to the speculative affirmation the opposite of which involves an obvious

contradiction and that liberty and with it morality must yield to the

mechanism of nature for the negation of morality involves no

contradiction except on the presupposition of liberty now morality does not

require the speculative cognition of liberty it is enough that i can think it

that its conception involves no contradiction that it does not interfere with

the mechanism of nature but even this requirement we could not satisfy if we

had not learnt the twofold sense in which things may be taken and it is only

in this way that the doctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature are

confined within their proper limits for this result then we are indebted to

a criticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard to things

in themselves and establishes the necessary limitation of our theoretical

cognition to mere phenomena



 7 in

order to cognize an object i must be able to prove its possibility

either from its reality as attested by experience or  priori by means

of reason but i can think what i please provided only i do not

contradict myself that is provided my conception is a possible thought

though i may be unable to answer for the existence of a corresponding object in

the sum of possibilities but something more is required before i can attribute

to such a conception objective validity that is real possibilitythe

other possibility being merely logical we are not however confined to

theoretical sources of cognition for the means of satisfying this additional

requirement but may derive them from practical sources




the positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in relation to the

conception of god and of the simple nature of the soul

admits of a similar exemplification but on this point i shall not dwell i

cannot even make the assumptionas the practical interests of morality

requireof god freedom and immortality if i do not deprive speculative

reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight for to arrive at these it

must make use of principles which in fact extend only to the objects of

possible experience and which cannot be applied to objects beyond this sphere

without converting them into phenomena and thus rendering the practical

extension of pure reason impossible i must therefore abolish

knowledge to make room for belief the dogmatism of metaphysics

that is the presumption that it is possible to advance in metaphysics without

previous criticism is the true source of the unbelief always dogmatic which

militates against morality




thus while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to posterity

in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in accordance with the

critique of pure reason still the value of such a bequest is not to be

depreciated it will render an important service to reason by substituting the

certainty of scientific method for that random groping after results without

the guidance of principles which has hitherto characterized the pursuit of

metaphysical studies it will render an important service to the inquiring mind

of youth by leading the student to apply his powers to the cultivation of

genuine science instead of wasting them as at present on speculations which

can never lead to any result or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas and

opinions but above all it will confer an inestimable benefit on morality and

religion by showing that all the objections urged against them may be silenced

for ever by the socratic method that is to say by proving the

ignorance of the objector for as the world has never been and no doubt

never will be without a system of metaphysics of one kind or another it is the

highest and weightiest concern of philosophy to render it powerless for harm

by closing up the sources of error




this important change in the field of the sciences this loss of its fancied

possessions to which speculative reason must submit does not prove in any way

detrimental to the general interests of humanity the advantages which the

world has derived from the teachings of pure reason are not at all impaired

the loss falls in its whole extent on the monopoly of the schools but

does not in the slightest degree touch the interests of mankind i

appeal to the most obstinate dogmatist whether the proof of the continued

existence of the soul after death derived from the simplicity of its

substance of the freedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of

nature drawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective and

objective practical necessity or of the existence of god deduced from the

conception of an ens realissimumthe contingency of the

changeable and the necessity of a prime mover has ever been able to pass

beyond the limits of the schools to penetrate the public mind or to exercise

the slightest influence on its convictions it must be admitted that this has

not been the case and that owing to the unfitness of the common understanding

for such subtle speculations it can never be expected to take place on the

contrary it is plain that the hope of a future life arises from the

feeling which exists in the breast of every man that the temporal is

inadequate to meet and satisfy the demands of his nature in like manner it

cannot be doubted that the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the

claims of inclination gives rise to the consciousness of freedom and

that the glorious order beauty and providential care everywhere displayed in

nature give rise to the belief in a wise and great author of the universe

such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind so far as they

depend on rational grounds and this public property not only remains

undisturbed but is even raised to greater importance by the doctrine that the

schools have no right to arrogate to themselves a more profound insight into a

matter of general human concernment than that to which the great mass of men

ever held by us in the highest estimation can without difficulty attain and

that the schools should therefore confine themselves to the elaboration of

these universally comprehensible and from a moral point of view amply

satisfactory proofs the change therefore affects only the arrogant

pretensions of the schools which would gladly retain in their own exclusive

possession the key to the truths which they impart to the public


 quod mecum nescit solus vult scire videri




at the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his just

title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the public without

its knowledgei mean the critique of pure reason this can never become

popular and indeed has no occasion to be so for finespun arguments in favour

of useful truths make just as little impression on the public mind as the

equally subtle objections brought against these truths on the other hand

since both inevitably force themselves on every man who rises to the height of

speculation it becomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a

thorough investigation of the rights of speculative reason and thus to

prevent the scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure sooner or later

to cause even to the masses it is only by criticism that metaphysicians and

as such theologians too can be saved from these controversies and from the

consequent perversion of their doctrines criticism alone can strike a blow at

the root of materialism fatalism atheism freethinking fanaticism and

superstition which are universally injuriousas well as of idealism and

scepticism which are dangerous to the schools but can scarcely pass over to

the public if governments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the

learned it would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests of

science as well as for those of society to favour a criticism of this kind

by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm basis than

to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools which raise a loud cry of

danger to the public over the destruction of cobwebs of which the public has

never taken any notice and the loss of which therefore it can never feel




this critical science is not opposed to the dogmatic procedure of reason

in pure cognition for pure cognition must always be dogmatic that is must

rest on strict demonstration from sure principles  prioribut to

dogmatism that is to the presumption that it is possible to make any

progress with a pure cognition derived from philosophical conceptions

according to the principles which reason has long been in the habit of

employingwithout first inquiring in what way and by what right reason

has come into the possession of these principles dogmatism is thus the

dogmatic procedure of pure reason without previous criticism of its own

powers and in opposing this procedure we must not be supposed to lend any

countenance to that loquacious shallowness which arrogates to itself the name

of popularity nor yet to scepticism which makes short work with the whole

science of metaphysics on the contrary our criticism is the necessary

preparation for a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysics which must

perform its task entirely  priori to the complete satisfaction of

speculative reason and must therefore be treated not popularly but

scholastically in carrying out the plan which the critique prescribes that

is in the future system of metaphysics we must have recourse to the strict

method of the celebrated wolf the greatest of all dogmatic

philosophers he was the first to point out the necessity of establishing fixed

principles of clearly defining our conceptions and of subjecting our

demonstrations to the most severe scrutiny instead of rashly jumping at

conclusions the example which he set served to awaken that spirit of profound

and thorough investigation which is not yet extinct in germany he would have

been peculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character to

metaphysical studies had it occurred to him to prepare the field by a

criticism of the organum that is of pure reason itself that he failed

to perceive the necessity of such a procedure must be ascribed to the dogmatic

mode of thought which characterized his age and on this point the philosophers

of his time as well as of all previous times have nothing to reproach each

other with those who reject at once the method of wolf and of the critique of

pure reason can have no other aim but to shake off the fetters of

science to change labour into sport certainty into opinion and

philosophy into philodoxy




in this second edition i have endeavoured as far as possible to

remove the difficulties and obscurity which without fault of mine perhaps

have given rise to many misconceptions even among acute thinkers in the

propositions themselves and in the demonstrations by which they are supported

as well as in the form and the entire plan of the work i have found nothing to

alter which must be attributed partly to the long examination to which i had

subjected the whole before offering it to the public and partly to the nature

of the case for pure speculative reason is an organic structure in which there

is nothing isolated or independent but every single part is essential to all

the rest and hence the slightest imperfection whether defect or positive

error could not fail to betray itself in use i venture further to hope

that this system will maintain the same unalterable character for the future i

am led to entertain this confidence not by vanity but by the evidence which

the equality of the result affords when we proceed first from the simplest

elements up to the complete whole of pure reason and and then backwards from

the whole to each part we find that the attempt to make the slightest

alteration in any part leads inevitably to contradictions not merely in this

system but in human reason itself at the same time there is still much room

for improvement in the exposition of the doctrines contained in this

work in the present edition i have endeavoured to remove misapprehensions of

the sthetical part especially with regard to the conception of time to clear

away the obscurity which has been found in the deduction of the conceptions of

the understanding to supply the supposed want of sufficient evidence in the

demonstration of the principles of the pure understanding and lastly to

obviate the misunderstanding of the paralogisms which immediately precede the

rational psychology beyond this pointthe end of the second main

division of the transcendental dialectici have not

extended my alterations8 partly from want of time and partly

because i am not aware that any portion of the remainder has given rise to

misconceptions among intelligent and impartial critics whom i do not here

mention with that praise which is their due but who will find that their

suggestions have been attended to in the work itself



 8 the

only addition properly so calledand that only in the method of

proofwhich i have made in the present edition consists of a new

refutation of psychological idealism and a strict

demonstrationthe only one possible as i believeof the objective

reality of external intuition however harmless idealism may be

consideredalthough in reality it is not soin regard to the

essential ends of metaphysics it must still remain a scandal to philosophy and

to the general human reason to be obliged to assume as an article of mere

belief the existence of things external to ourselves from which yet we

derive the whole material of cognition for the internal sense and not to be

able to oppose a satisfactory proof to any one who may call it in question as

there is some obscurity of expression in the demonstration as it stands in the

text i propose to alter the passage in question as follows but this

permanent cannot be an intuition in me for all the determining grounds of my

existence which can be found in me are representations and as such do

themselves require a permanent distinct from them which may determine my

existence in relation to their changes that is my existence in time wherein

they change it may probably be urged in opposition to this proof

that after all i am only conscious immediately of that which is in me that

is of my representation of external things and that consequently it

must always remain uncertain whether anything corresponding to this

representation does or does not exist externally to me but i am conscious

through internal experience of my existence in time

consequently also of the determinability of the former in the latter and

that is more than the simple consciousness of my representation it is in

fact the same as the empirical consciousness of my existence which can

only be determined in relation to something which while connected with my

existence is external to me this consciousness of my existence in time

is therefore identical with the consciousness of a relation to something

external to me and it is therefore experience not fiction sense not

imagination which inseparably connects the external with my internal sense

for the external sense is in itself the relation of intuition to something

real external to me and the reality of this something as opposed to the mere

imagination of it rests solely on its inseparable connection with internal

experience as the condition of its possibility if with the intellectual

consciousness of my existence in the representation i am which

accompanies all my judgements and all the operations of my understanding i

could at the same time connect a determination of my existence by

intellectual intuition then the consciousness of a relation to

something external to me would not be necessary but the internal intuition in

which alone my existence can be determined though preceded by that purely

intellectual consciousness is itself sensible and attached to the condition of

time hence this determination of my existence and consequently my internal

experience itself must depend on something permanent which is not in me which

can be therefore only in something external to me to which i must look upon

myself as being related thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily

connected with that of the internal in order to the possibility of experience

in general that is i am just as certainly conscious that there are things

external to me related to my sense as i am that i myself exist as determined in

time but in order to ascertain to what given intuitions objects external me

really correspond in other words what intuitions belong to the external sense

and not to imagination i must have recourse in every particular case to

those rules according to which experience in general even internal experience

is distinguished from imagination and which are always based on the

proposition that there really is an external experiencewe may add the

remark that the representation of something permanent in existence is

not the same thing as the permanent representation for a representation

may be very variable and changingas all our representations even that

of matter areand yet refer to something permanent which must

therefore be distinct from all my representations and external to me the

existence of which is necessarily included in the determination of my own

existence and with it constitutes one experiencean experience

which would not even be possible internally if it were not also at the same

time in part external to the question how we are no more able to

reply than we are in general to think the stationary in time the

coexistence of which with the variable produces the conception of change




in attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible as possible

i have been compelled to leave out or abridge various passages which were not

essential to the completeness of the work but which many readers might

consider useful in other respects and might be unwilling to miss this

trifling loss which could not be avoided without swelling the book beyond due

limits may be supplied at the pleasure of the reader by a comparison with

the first edition and will i hope be more than compensated for by the

greater clearness of the exposition as it now stands




i have observed with pleasure and thankfulness in the pages of various

reviews and treatises that the spirit of profound and thorough investigation

is not extinct in germany though it may have been overborne and silenced for a

time by the fashionable tone of a licence in thinking which gives itself the

airs of genius and that the difficulties which beset the paths of criticism

have not prevented energetic and acute thinkers from making themselves masters

of the science of pure reason to which these paths conducta science

which is not popular but scholastic in its character and which alone can hope

for a lasting existence or possess an abiding value to these deserving men

who so happily combine profundity of view with a talent for lucid

expositiona talent which i myself am not conscious of possessingi

leave the task of removing any obscurity which may still adhere to the

statement of my doctrines for in this case the danger is not that of being

refuted but of being misunderstood for my own part i must henceforward

abstain from controversy although i shall carefully attend to all suggestions

whether from friends or adversaries which may be of use in the future

elaboration of the system of this propdeutic as during these labours i have

advanced pretty far in years this month i reach my sixtyfourth yearit

will be necessary for me to economize time if i am to carry out my plan of

elaborating the metaphysics of nature as well as of morals in confirmation of

the correctness of the principles established in this critique of pure reason

both speculative and practical and i must therefore leave the task of

clearing up the obscurities of the present workinevitable perhaps at

the outsetas well as the defence of the whole to those deserving men

who have made my system their own a philosophical system cannot come forward

armed at all points like a mathematical treatise and hence it may be quite

possible to take objection to particular passages while the organic structure

of the system considered as a unity has no danger to apprehend but few

possess the ability and still fewer the inclination to take a comprehensive

view of a new system by confining the view to particular passages taking

these out of their connection and comparing them with one another it is easy

to pick out apparent contradictions especially in a work written with any

freedom of style these contradictions place the work in an unfavourable light

in the eyes of those who rely on the judgement of others but are easily

reconciled by those who have mastered the idea of the whole if a theory

possesses stability in itself the action and reaction which seemed at first to

threaten its existence serve only in the course of time to smooth down any

superficial roughness or inequality andif men of insight impartiality

and truly popular gifts turn their attention to itto secure to it in a

short time the requisite elegance also

introduction
i of the difference between pure and empirical

knowledge


that all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt for how is

it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened into exercise

otherwise than by means of objects which affect our senses and partly of

themselves produce representations partly rouse our powers of understanding

into activity to compare to connect or to separate these and so to convert

the raw material of our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects which

is called experience in respect of time therefore no knowledge of ours is

antecedent to experience but begins with it




but though all our knowledge begins with experience it by no means follows

that all arises out of experience for on the contrary it is quite possible

that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through

impressions and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself

sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion an addition which we cannot

distinguish from the original element given by sense till long practice has

made us attentive to and skilful in separating it it is therefore a

question which requires close investigation and not to be answered at first

sight whether there exists a knowledge altogether independent of experience

and even of all sensuous impressions knowledge of this kind is called 

priori in contradistinction to empirical knowledge which has its sources 

posteriori that is in experience




but the expression  priori is not as yet definite enough

adequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started for in

speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience we are wont to say

that this or that may be known  priori because we do not derive this

knowledge immediately from experience but from a general rule which however

we have itself borrowed from experience thus if a man undermined his house

we say he might know  priori that it would have fallen that

is he needed not to have waited for the experience that it did actually fall

but still  priori he could not know even this much for that bodies are

heavy and consequently that they fall when their supports are taken away

must have been known to him previously by means of experience




by the term knowledge  priori therefore we shall in the sequel

understand not such as is independent of this or that kind of experience but

such as is absolutely so of all experience opposed to this is empirical

knowledge or that which is possible only  posteriori that is through

experience knowledge  priori is either pure or impure pure knowledge 

priori is that with which no empirical element is mixed up for example the

proposition every change has a cause is a proposition  priori

but impure because change is a conception which can only be derived from

experience


ii the human intellect even in an unphilosophical

state is in possession of certain cognitions  priori


the question now is as to a criterion by which we may securely distinguish a

pure from an empirical cognition experience no doubt teaches us that this or

that object is constituted in such and such a manner but not that it could not

possibly exist otherwise now in the first place if we have a proposition

which contains the idea of necessity in its very conception it is priori if

moreover it is not derived from any other proposition unless from one equally

involving the idea of necessity it is absolutely priori secondly an

empirical judgement never exhibits strict and absolute but only assumed and

comparative universality by induction therefore the most we can say

isso far as we have hitherto observed there is no exception to this or

that rule if on the other hand a judgement carries with it strict and

absolute universality that is admits of no possible exception it is not

derived from experience but is valid absolutely  priori




empirical universality is therefore only an arbitrary extension of validity

from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid in most cases to that

which is asserted of a proposition which holds good in all as for example in

the affirmation all bodies are heavy when on the contrary

strict universality characterizes a judgement it necessarily indicates another

peculiar source of knowledge namely a faculty of cognition  priori

necessity and strict universality therefore are infallible tests for

distinguishing pure from empirical knowledge and are inseparably connected

with each other but as in the use of these criteria the empirical limitation

is sometimes more easily detected than the contingency of the judgement or the

unlimited universality which we attach to a judgement is often a more

convincing proof than its necessity it may be advisable to use the criteria

separately each being by itself infallible




now that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are

necessary and in the strictest sense universal consequently pure  priori it

will be an easy matter to show if we desire an example from the sciences we

need only take any proposition in mathematics if we cast our eyes upon the

commonest operations of the understanding the proposition every change

must have a cause will amply serve our purpose in the latter case

indeed the conception of a cause so plainly involves the conception of a

necessity of connection with an effect and of a strict universality of the

law that the very notion of a cause would entirely disappear were we to

derive it like hume from a frequent association of what happens with that

which precedes and the habit thence originating of connecting

representationsthe necessity inherent in the judgement being therefore

merely subjective besides without seeking for such examples of principles

existing  priori in cognition we might easily show that such principles are

the indispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself and

consequently prove their existence  priori for whence could our experience

itself acquire certainty if all the rules on which it depends were themselves

empirical and consequently fortuitous no one therefore can admit the

validity of the use of such rules as first principles but for the present we

may content ourselves with having established the fact that we do possess and

exercise a faculty of pure  priori cognition and secondly with having

pointed out the proper tests of such cognition namely universality and

necessity




not only in judgements however but even in conceptions is an  priori origin

manifest for example if we take away by degrees from our conceptions of a

body all that can be referred to mere sensuous experiencecolour

hardness or softness weight even impenetrabilitythe body will then

vanish but the space which it occupied still remains and this it is utterly

impossible to annihilate in thought again if we take away in like manner

from our empirical conception of any object corporeal or incorporeal all

properties which mere experience has taught us to connect with it still we

cannot think away those through which we cogitate it as substance or adhering

to substance although our conception of substance is more determined than that

of an object compelled therefore by that necessity with which the conception

of substance forces itself upon us we must confess that it has its seat in our

faculty of cognition  priori


iii philosophy stands in need of a science which

shall determine the possibility principles and extent of human knowledge

 priori


of far more importance than all that has been above said is the consideration

that certain of our cognitions rise completely above the sphere of all possible

experience and by means of conceptions to which there exists in the whole

extent of experience no corresponding object seem to extend the range of our

judgements beyond its bounds and just in this transcendental or supersensible

sphere where experience affords us neither instruction nor guidance lie the

investigations of reason which on account of their importance we consider

far preferable to and as having a far more elevated aim than all that the

understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous phenomena so high a

value do we set upon these investigations that even at the risk of error we

persist in following them out and permit neither doubt nor disregard nor

indifference to restrain us from the pursuit these unavoidable problems of

mere pure reason are god freedom of will and immortality the science

which with all its preliminaries has for its especial object the solution of

these problems is named metaphysicsa science which is at the very outset

dogmatical that is it confidently takes upon itself the execution of this

task without any previous investigation of the ability or inability of reason

for such an undertaking




now the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned it seems nevertheless

natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with the cognitions we

possess without knowing whence they come and on the strength of principles

the origin of which is undiscovered instead of thus trying to build without a

foundation it is rather to be expected that we should long ago have put the

question how the understanding can arrive at these  priori cognitions and

what is the extent validity and worth which they may possess we say

this is natural enough meaning by the word natural that which

is consistent with a just and reasonable way of thinking but if we understand

by the term that which usually happens nothing indeed could be more natural

and more comprehensible than that this investigation should be left long

unattempted for one part of our pure knowledge the science of mathematics

has been long firmly established and thus leads us to form flattering

expectations with regard to others though these may be of quite a different

nature besides when we get beyond the bounds of experience we are of course

safe from opposition in that quarter and the charm of widening the range of

our knowledge is so great that unless we are brought to a standstill by some

evident contradiction we hurry on undoubtingly in our course this however

may be avoided if we are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our

fictions which are not the less fictions on that account




mathematical science affords us a brilliant example how far independently of

all experience we may carry our  priori knowledge it is true that the

mathematician occupies himself with objects and cognitions only in so far as

they can be represented by means of intuition but this circumstance is easily

overlooked because the said intuition can itself be given  priori and

therefore is hardly to be distinguished from a mere pure conception deceived

by such a proof of the power of reason we can perceive no limits to the

extension of our knowledge the light dove cleaving in free flight the thin

air whose resistance it feels might imagine that her movements would be far

more free and rapid in airless space just in the same way did plato

abandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to the

understanding venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it into the void space

of pure intellect he did not reflect that he made no real progress by all his

efforts for he met with no resistance which might serve him for a support as

it were whereon to rest and on which he might apply his powers in order to

let the intellect acquire momentum for its progress it is indeed the common

fate of human reason in speculation to finish the imposing edifice of thought

as rapidly as possible and then for the first time to begin to examine whether

the foundation is a solid one or no arrived at this point all sorts of

excuses are sought after in order to console us for its want of stability or

rather indeed to enable us to dispense altogether with so late and dangerous

an investigation but what frees us during the process of building from all

apprehension or suspicion and flatters us into the belief of its solidity is

this a great part perhaps the greatest part of the business of our reason

consists in the analysation of the conceptions which we already possess of

objects by this means we gain a multitude of cognitions which although really

nothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which though in a

confused manner was already thought in our conceptions are at least in

respect of their form prized as new introspections whilst so far as regards

their matter or content we have really made no addition to our conceptions

but only disinvolved them but as this process does furnish a real priori

knowledge which has a sure progress and useful results reason deceived by

this slips in without being itself aware of it assertions of a quite

different kind in which to given conceptions it adds others  priori indeed

but entirely foreign to them without our knowing how it arrives at these and

indeed without such a question ever suggesting itself i shall therefore at

once proceed to examine the difference between these two modes of knowledge


iv of the difference between analytical and

synthetical judgements


in all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate is

cogitated i mention affirmative judgements only here the application to

negative will be very easy this relation is possible in two different ways

either the predicate b belongs to the subject a as somewhat which is contained

though covertly in the conception a or the predicate b lies completely out

of the conception a although it stands in connection with it in the first

instance i term the judgement analytical in the second synthetical

analytical judgements affirmative are therefore those in which the connection

of the predicate with the subject is cogitated through identity those in which

this connection is cogitated without identity are called synthetical

judgements the former may be called explicative the latter augmentative

judgements because the former add in the predicate nothing to the conception

of the subject but only analyse it into its constituent conceptions which

were thought already in the subject although in a confused manner the latter

add to our conceptions of the subject a predicate which was not contained in

it and which no analysis could ever have discovered therein for example when

i say all bodies are extended this is an analytical judgement

for i need not go beyond the conception of body in order to find extension

connected with it but merely analyse the conception that is become conscious

of the manifold properties which i think in that conception in order to

discover this predicate in it it is therefore an analytical judgement on the

other hand when i say all bodies are heavy the predicate is

something totally different from that which i think in the mere conception of a

body by the addition of such a predicate therefore it becomes a synthetical

judgement




judgements of experience as such are always synthetical for it would be

absurd to think of grounding an analytical judgement on experience because in

forming such a judgement i need not go out of the sphere of my conceptions and

therefore recourse to the testimony of experience is quite unnecessary that

bodies are extended is not an empirical judgement but a

proposition which stands firm  priori for before addressing myself to

experience i already have in my conception all the requisite conditions for

the judgement and i have only to extract the predicate from the conception

according to the principle of contradiction and thereby at the same time

become conscious of the necessity of the judgement a necessity which i could

never learn from experience on the other hand though at first i do not at all

include the predicate of weight in my conception of body in general that

conception still indicates an object of experience a part of the totality of

experience to which i can still add other parts and this i do when i

recognize by observation that bodies are heavy i can cognize beforehand by

analysis the conception of body through the characteristics of extension

impenetrability shape etc all which are cogitated in this conception but

now i extend my knowledge and looking back on experience from which i had

derived this conception of body i find weight at all times connected with the

above characteristics and therefore i synthetically add to my conceptions this

as a predicate and say all bodies are heavy thus it is

experience upon which rests the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate

of weight with the conception of body because both conceptions although the

one is not contained in the other still belong to one another only

contingently however as parts of a whole namely of experience which is

itself a synthesis of intuitions




but to synthetical judgements  priori such aid is entirely wanting if i go

out of and beyond the conception a in order to recognize another b as

connected with it what foundation have i to rest on whereby to render the

synthesis possible i have here no longer the advantage of looking out in the

sphere of experience for what i want let us take for example the

proposition everything that happens has a cause in the

conception of something that happens i indeed think an existence

which a certain time antecedes and from this i can derive analytical

judgements but the conception of a cause lies quite out of the above

conception and indicates something entirely different from that which

happens and is consequently not contained in that conception how then

am i able to assert concerning the general conceptionthat which

happenssomething entirely different from that conception and to

recognize the conception of cause although not contained in it yet as

belonging to it and even necessarily what is here the unknown  x upon which

the understanding rests when it believes it has found out of the conception a

a foreign predicate b which it nevertheless considers to be connected with it

it cannot be experience because the principle adduced annexes the two

representations cause and effect to the representation existence not only

with universality which experience cannot give but also with the expression

of necessity therefore completely  priori and from pure conceptions upon

such synthetical that is augmentative propositions depends the whole aim of

our speculative knowledge  priori for although analytical judgements are

indeed highly important and necessary they are so only to arrive at that

clearness of conceptions which is requisite for a sure and extended synthesis

and this alone is a real acquisition


v in all theoretical sciences of reason synthetical

judgements  priori are contained as principles


1 mathematical judgements are always synthetical hitherto this fact though

incontestably true and very important in its consequences seems to have

escaped the analysts of the human mind nay to be in complete opposition to

all their conjectures for as it was found that mathematical conclusions all

proceed according to the principle of contradiction which the nature of every

apodeictic certainty requires people became persuaded that the fundamental

principles of the science also were recognized and admitted in the same way

but the notion is fallacious for although a synthetical proposition can

certainly be discerned by means of the principle of contradiction this is

possible only when another synthetical proposition precedes from which the

latter is deduced but never of itself




before all be it observed that proper mathematical propositions are always

judgements  priori and not empirical because they carry along with them the

conception of necessity which cannot be given by experience if this be

demurred to it matters not i will then limit my assertion to pure

mathematics the very conception of which implies that it consists of knowledge

altogether nonempirical and  priori




we might indeed at first suppose that the proposition 7  5  12 is a merely

analytical proposition following according to the principle of contradiction

from the conception of a sum of seven and five but if we regard it more

narrowly we find that our conception of the sum of seven and five contains

nothing more than the uniting of both sums into one whereby it cannot at all

be cogitated what this single number is which embraces both the conception of

twelve is by no means obtained by merely cogitating the union of seven and

five and we may analyse our conception of such a possible sum as long as we

will still we shall never discover in it the notion of twelve we must go

beyond these conceptions and have recourse to an intuition which corresponds

to one of the twoour five fingers for example or like segner in his

arithmetic five points and so by degrees add the units contained in the five

given in the intuition to the conception of seven for i first take the number

7 and for the conception of 5 calling in the aid of the fingers of my hand as

objects of intuition i add the units which i before took together to make up

the number 5 gradually now by means of the material image my hand to the

number 7 and by this process i at length see the number 12 arise that 7

should be added to 5 i have certainly cogitated in my conception of a sum  7

 5 but not that this sum was equal to 12 arithmetical propositions are

therefore always synthetical of which we may become more clearly convinced by

trying large numbers for it will thus become quite evident that turn and

twist our conceptions as we may it is impossible without having recourse to

intuition to arrive at the sum total or product by means of the mere analysis

of our conceptions just as little is any principle of pure geometry

analytical a straight line between two points is the shortest

is a synthetical proposition for my conception of straight contains no notion

of quantity but is merely qualitative the conception of the shortest is

therefore fore wholly an addition and by no analysis can it be extracted from

our conception of a straight line intuition must therefore here lend its aid

by means of which and thus only our synthesis is possible




some few principles preposited by geometricians are indeed really analytical

and depend on the principle of contradiction they serve however like

identical propositions as links in the chain of method not as

principlesfor example a  a the whole is equal to itself or ab

 a the whole is greater than its part and yet even these principles

themselves though they derive their validity from pure conceptions are only

admitted in mathematics because they can be presented in intuition what causes

us here commonly to believe that the predicate of such apodeictic judgements is

already contained in our conception and that the judgement is therefore

analytical is merely the equivocal nature of the expression we must join in

thought a certain predicate to a given conception and this necessity cleaves

already to the conception but the question is not what we must join in

thought to the given conception but what we really think therein though only

obscurely and then it becomes manifest that the predicate pertains to these

conceptions necessarily indeed yet not as thought in the conception itself

but by virtue of an intuition which must be added to the conception




2 the science of natural philosophy physics contains in itself synthetical

judgements  priori as principles i shall adduce two propositions for

instance the proposition in all changes of the material world the

quantity of matter remains unchanged or that in all

communication of motion action and reaction must always be equal in

both of these not only is the necessity and therefore their origin  priori

clear but also that they are synthetical propositions for in the conception

of matter i do not cogitate its permanency but merely its presence in space

which it fills i therefore really go out of and beyond the conception of

matter in order to think on to it something  priori which i did not think in

it the proposition is therefore not analytical but synthetical and

nevertheless conceived  priori and so it is with regard to the other

propositions of the pure part of natural philosophy




3 as to metaphysics even if we look upon it merely as an attempted science

yet from the nature of human reason an indispensable one we find that it

must contain synthetical propositions  priori it is not merely the duty of

metaphysics to dissect and thereby analytically to illustrate the conceptions

which we form  priori of things but we seek to widen the range of our 

priori knowledge for this purpose we must avail ourselves of such principles

as add something to the original conceptionsomething not identical with

nor contained in it and by means of synthetical judgements  priori leave far

behind us the limits of experience for example in the proposition the

world must have a beginning and such like thus metaphysics according

to the proper aim of the science consists merely of synthetical propositions 

priori


vi the universal problem of pure reason


it is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of investigations

under the formula of a single problem for in this manner we not only

facilitate our own labour inasmuch as we define it clearly to ourselves but

also render it more easy for others to decide whether we have done justice to

our undertaking the proper problem of pure reason then is contained in the

question how are synthetical judgements  priori possible




that metaphysical science has hitherto remained in so vacillating a state of

uncertainty and contradiction is only to be attributed to the fact that this

great problem and perhaps even the difference between analytical and

synthetical judgements did not sooner suggest itself to philosophers upon the

solution of this problem or upon sufficient proof of the impossibility of

synthetical knowledge  priori depends the existence or downfall of the

science of metaphysics among philosophers david hume came the nearest of all

to this problem yet it never acquired in his mind sufficient precision nor

did he regard the question in its universality on the contrary he stopped

short at the synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with its

cause principium causalitatis insisting that such proposition  priori was

impossible according to his conclusions then all that we term metaphysical

science is a mere delusion arising from the fancied insight of reason into

that which is in truth borrowed from experience and to which habit has given

the appearance of necessity against this assertion destructive to all pure

philosophy he would have been guarded had he had our problem before his eyes

in its universality for he would then have perceived that according to his

own argument there likewise could not be any pure mathematical science which

assuredly cannot exist without synthetical propositions  priorian

absurdity from which his good understanding must have saved him




in the solution of the above problem is at the same time comprehended the

possibility of the use of pure reason in the foundation and construction of all

sciences which contain theoretical knowledge  priori of objects that is to

say the answer to the following questions




how is pure mathematical science possible




how is pure natural science possible




respecting these sciences as they do certainly exist it may with propriety be

asked how they are possiblefor that they must be possible is shown by

the fact of their really existing9 but as to metaphysics the miserable

progress it has hitherto made and the fact that of no one system yet brought

forward far as regards its true aim can it be said that this science really

exists leaves any one at liberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of

its existence



 9

as to the existence of pure natural science or physics perhaps many may still

express doubts but we have only to look at the different propositions which

are commonly treated of at the commencement of proper empirical physical

sciencethose for example relating to the permanence of the same

quantity of matter the vis inertiae the equality of action and reaction

etcto be soon convinced that they form a science of pure physics

physica pura or rationalis which well deserves to be separately exposed as

a special science in its whole extent whether that be great or confined




yet in a certain sense this kind of knowledge must unquestionably be looked

upon as given in other words metaphysics must be considered as really

existing if not as a science nevertheless as a natural disposition of the

human mind metaphysica naturalis for human reason without any instigations

imputable to the mere vanity of great knowledge unceasingly progresses urged

on by its own feeling of need towards such questions as cannot be answered by

any empirical application of reason or principles derived therefrom and so

there has ever really existed in every man some system of metaphysics it will

always exist so soon as reason awakes to the exercise of its power of

speculation and now the question arises how is metaphysics as a

natural disposition possible in other words how from the nature of

universal human reason do those questions arise which pure reason proposes to

itself and which it is impelled by its own feeling of need to answer as well

as it can




but as in all the attempts hitherto made to answer the questions which reason

is prompted by its very nature to propose to itself for example whether the

world had a beginning or has existed from eternity it has always met with

unavoidable contradictions we must not rest satisfied with the mere natural

disposition of the mind to metaphysics that is with the existence of the

faculty of pure reason whence indeed some sort of metaphysical system always

arises but it must be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the

question whether we know or do not know the things of which metaphysics treats

we must be able to arrive at a decision on the subjects of its questions or on

the ability or inability of reason to form any judgement respecting them and

therefore either to extend with confidence the bounds of our pure reason or to

set strictly defined and safe limits to its action this last question which

arises out of the above universal problem would properly run thus how

is metaphysics possible as a science




thus the critique of reason leads at last naturally and necessarily to

science and on the other hand the dogmatical use of reason without criticism

leads to groundless assertions against which others equally specious can

always be set thus ending unavoidably in scepticism




besides this science cannot be of great and formidable prolixity because it

has not to do with objects of reason the variety of which is inexhaustible

but merely with reason herself and her problems problems which arise out of

her own bosom and are not proposed to her by the nature of outward things but

by her own nature and when once reason has previously become able completely

to understand her own power in regard to objects which she meets with in

experience it will be easy to determine securely the extent and limits of her

attempted application to objects beyond the confines of experience




we may and must therefore regard the attempts hitherto made to establish

metaphysical science dogmatically as nonexistent for what of analysis that

is mere dissection of conceptions is contained in one or other is not the

aim of but only a preparation for metaphysics proper which has for its object

the extension by means of synthesis of our  priori knowledge and for this

purpose mere analysis is of course useless because it only shows what is

contained in these conceptions but not how we arrive  priori at them and

this it is her duty to show in order to be able afterwards to determine their

valid use in regard to all objects of experience to all knowledge in general

but little selfdenial indeed is needed to give up these pretensions seeing

the undeniable and in the dogmatic mode of procedure inevitable

contradictions of reason with herself have long since ruined the reputation of

every system of metaphysics that has appeared up to this time it will require

more firmness to remain undeterred by difficulty from within and opposition

from without from endeavouring by a method quite opposed to all those

hitherto followed to further the growth and fruitfulness of a science

indispensable to human reasona science from which every branch it has

borne may be cut away but whose roots remain indestructible


vii idea and division of a particular science under

the name of a critique of pure reason


from all that has been said there results the idea of a particular science

which may be called the critique of pure reason for reason is the faculty

which furnishes us with the principles of knowledge  priori hence pure

reason is the faculty which contains the principles of cognizing anything

absolutely  priori an organon of pure reason would be a compendium of those

principles according to which alone all pure cognitions  priori can be

obtained the completely extended application of such an organon would afford

us a system of pure reason as this however is demanding a great deal and it

is yet doubtful whether any extension of our knowledge be here possible or if

so in what cases we can regard a science of the mere criticism of pure

reason its sources and limits as the propdeutic to a system of pure reason

such a science must not be called a doctrine but only a critique of pure

reason and its use in regard to speculation would be only negative not to

enlarge the bounds of but to purify our reason and to shield it against

errorwhich alone is no little gain i apply the term transcendental to

all knowledge which is not so much occupied with objects as with the mode of

our cognition of these objects so far as this mode of cognition is possible 

priori a system of such conceptions would be called transcendental philosophy

but this again is still beyond the bounds of our present essay for as such a

science must contain a complete exposition not only of our synthetical 

priori but of our analytical  priori knowledge it is of too wide a range for

our present purpose because we do not require to carry our analysis any

farther than is necessary to understand in their full extent the principles

of synthesis  priori with which alone we have to do this investigation

which we cannot properly call a doctrine but only a transcendental critique

because it aims not at the enlargement but at the correction and guidance of

our knowledge and is to serve as a touchstone of the worth or worthlessness of

all knowledge  priori is the sole object of our present essay such a

critique is consequently as far as possible a preparation for an organon and

if this new organon should be found to fail at least for a canon of pure

reason according to which the complete system of the philosophy of pure

reason whether it extend or limit the bounds of that reason might one day be

set forth both analytically and synthetically for that this is possible nay

that such a system is not of so great extent as to preclude the hope of its

ever being completed is evident for we have not here to do with the nature of

outward objects which is infinite but solely with the mind which judges of

the nature of objects and again with the mind only in respect of its

cognition  priori and the object of our investigations as it is not to be

sought without but altogether within ourselves cannot remain concealed and

in all probability is limited enough to be completely surveyed and fairly

estimated according to its worth or worthlessness still less let the reader

here expect a critique of books and systems of pure reason our present object

is exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself only when we

make this critique our foundation do we possess a pure touchstone for

estimating the philosophical value of ancient and modern writings on this

subject and without this criterion the incompetent historian or judge decides

upon and corrects the groundless assertions of others with his own which have

themselves just as little foundation




transcendental philosophy is the idea of a science for which the critique of

pure reason must sketch the whole plan architectonically that is from

principles with a full guarantee for the validity and stability of all the

parts which enter into the building it is the system of all the principles of

pure reason if this critique itself does not assume the title of

transcendental philosophy it is only because to be a complete system it

ought to contain a full analysis of all human knowledge  priori our critique

must indeed lay before us a complete enumeration of all the radical

conceptions which constitute the said pure knowledge but from the complete

analysis of these conceptions themselves as also from a complete investigation

of those derived from them it abstains with reason partly because it would be

deviating from the end in view to occupy itself with this analysis since this

process is not attended with the difficulty and insecurity to be found in the

synthesis to which our critique is entirely devoted and partly because it

would be inconsistent with the unity of our plan to burden this essay with the

vindication of the completeness of such an analysis and deduction with which

after all we have at present nothing to do this completeness of the analysis

of these radical conceptions as well as of the deduction from the conceptions

 priori which may be given by the analysis we can however easily attain

provided only that we are in possession of all these radical conceptions which

are to serve as principles of the synthesis and that in respect of this main

purpose nothing is wanting




to the critique of pure reason therefore belongs all that constitutes

transcendental philosophy and it is the complete idea of transcendental

philosophy but still not the science itself because it only proceeds so far

with the analysis as is necessary to the power of judging completely of our

synthetical knowledge  priori




the principal thing we must attend to in the division of the parts of a

science like this is that no conceptions must enter it which contain aught

empirical in other words that the knowledge  priori must be completely pure

hence although the highest principles and fundamental conceptions of morality

are certainly cognitions  priori yet they do not belong to transcendental

philosophy because though they certainly do not lay the conceptions of pain

pleasure desires inclinations etc which are all of empirical origin at

the foundation of its precepts yet still into the conception of dutyas

an obstacle to be overcome or as an incitement which should not be made into a

motivethese empirical conceptions must necessarily enter in the

construction of a system of pure morality transcendental philosophy is

consequently a philosophy of the pure and merely speculative reason for all

that is practical so far as it contains motives relates to feelings and

these belong to empirical sources of cognition




if we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of a science

in general it ought to comprehend first a doctrine of the elements and

secondly a doctrine of the method of pure reason each of these main divisions

will have its subdivisions the separate reasons for which we cannot here

particularize only so much seems necessary by way of introduction of

premonition that there are two sources of human knowledge which probably

spring from a common but to us unknown root namely sense and understanding

by the former objects are given to us by the latter thought so far as the

faculty of sense may contain representations  priori which form the

conditions under which objects are given in so far it belongs to

transcendental philosophy the transcendental doctrine of sense must form the

first part of our science of elements because the conditions under which alone

the objects of human knowledge are given must precede those under which they

are thought




i transcendental doctrine of elements
first part transcendental sthetic
 i introductory


in whatsoever mode or by whatsoever means our knowledge may relate to

objects it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which it

immediately relates to them is by means of an intuition to this as the

indispensable groundwork all thought points but an intuition can take place

only in so far as the object is given to us this again is only possible to

man at least on condition that the object affect the mind in a certain manner

the capacity for receiving representations receptivity through the mode in

which we are affected by objects objects is called sensibility by means of

sensibility therefore objects are given to us and it alone furnishes us with

intuitions by the understanding they are thought and from it arise

conceptions but an thought must directly or indirectly by means of certain

signs relate ultimately to intuitions consequently with us to sensibility

because in no other way can an object be given to us




the effect of an object upon the faculty of representation so far as we are

affected by the said object is sensation that sort of intuition which relates

to an object by means of sensation is called an empirical intuition the

undetermined object of an empirical intuition is called phenomenon that which

in the phenomenon corresponds to the sensation i term its matter but that

which effects that the content of the phenomenon can be arranged under certain

relations i call its form but that in which our sensations are merely

arranged and by which they are susceptible of assuming a certain form cannot

be itself sensation it is then the matter of all phenomena that is given to

us  posteriori the form must lie ready  priori for them in the mind and

consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation




i call all representations pure in the transcendental meaning of the word

wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation and accordingly we find

existing in the mind  priori the pure form of sensuous intuitions in general

in which all the manifold content of the phenomenal world is arranged and

viewed under certain relations this pure form of sensibility i shall call pure

intuition thus if i take away from our representation of a body all that the

understanding thinks as belonging to it as substance force divisibility

etc and also whatever belongs to sensation as impenetrability hardness

colour etc yet there is still something left us from this empirical

intuition namely extension and shape these belong to pure intuition which

exists  priori in the mind as a mere form of sensibility and without any

real object of the senses or any sensation




the science of all the principles of sensibility  priori i call

transcendental sthetic10 there must then be such a science

forming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements in

contradistinction to that part which contains the principles of pure thought

and which is called transcendental logic

the germans are the only people who at present use this word to indicate what

others call the critique of taste at the foundation of this term lies the

disappointed hope which the eminent analyst baumgarten conceived of

subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to principles of reason and so of

elevating its rules into a science but his endeavours were vain for the said

rules or criteria are in respect to their chief sources merely empirical

consequently never can serve as determinate laws  priori by which our

judgement in matters of taste is to be directed it is rather our judgement

which forms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles on this

account it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating the

critique of taste and to apply it solely to that doctrine which is true

sciencethe science of the laws of sensibilityand thus come nearer

to the language and the sense of the ancients in their wellknown division of

the objects of cognition into aiotheta kai noeta or to share it with

speculative philosophy and employ it partly in a transcendental partly in a

psychological signification




in the science of transcendental sthetic accordingly we shall first isolate

sensibility or the sensuous faculty by separating from it all that is annexed

to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding so that nothing be left

but empirical intuition in the next place we shall take away from this

intuition all that belongs to sensation so that nothing may remain but pure

intuition and the mere form of phenomena which is all that the sensibility

can afford  priori from this investigation it will be found that there are

two pure forms of sensuous intuition as principles of knowledge  priori

namely space and time to the consideration of these we shall now proceed


section i of space
 2 metaphysical exposition of this conception


by means of the external sense a property of the mind we represent to

ourselves objects as without us and these all in space herein alone are their

shape dimensions and relations to each other determined or determinable the

internal sense by means of which the mind contemplates itself or its internal

state gives indeed no intuition of the soul as an object yet there is

nevertheless a determinate form under which alone the contemplation of our

internal state is possible so that all which relates to the inward

determinations of the mind is represented in relations of time of time we

cannot have any external intuition any more than we can have an internal

intuition of space what then are time and space are they real existences or

are they merely relations or determinations of things such however as would

equally belong to these things in themselves though they should never become

objects of intuition or are they such as belong only to the form of

intuition and consequently to the subjective constitution of the mind without

which these predicates of time and space could not be attached to any object

in order to become informed on these points we shall first give an exposition

of the conception of space by exposition i mean the clear though not

detailed representation of that which belongs to a conception and an

exposition is metaphysical when it contains that which represents the

conception as given  priori




1 space is not a conception which has been derived from outward experiences

for in order that certain sensations may relate to something without me that

is to something which occupies a different part of space from that in which i

am in like manner in order that i may represent them not merely as without

of and near to each other but also in separate places the representation of

space must already exist as a foundation consequently the representation of

space cannot be borrowed from the relations of external phenomena through

experience but on the contrary this external experience is itself only

possible through the said antecedent representation




2 space then is a necessary representation  priori which serves for the

foundation of all external intuitions we never can imagine or make a

representation to ourselves of the nonexistence of space though we may easily

enough think that no objects are found in it it must therefore be considered

as the condition of the possibility of phenomena and by no means as a

determination dependent on them and is a representation  priori which

necessarily supplies the basis for external phenomena




3 space is no discursive or as we say general conception of the relations of

things but a pure intuition for in the first place we can only represent to

ourselves one space and when we talk of divers spaces we mean only parts of

one and the same space moreover these parts cannot antecede this one

allembracing space as the component parts from which the aggregate can be

made up but can be cogitated only as existing in it space is essentially one

and multiplicity in it consequently the general notion of spaces of this or

that space depends solely upon limitations hence it follows that an  priori

intuition which is not empirical lies at the root of all our conceptions of

space thus moreover the principles of geometryfor example that

in a triangle two sides together are greater than the third are

never deduced from general conceptions of line and triangle but from

intuition and this  priori with apodeictic certainty




4 space is represented as an infinite given quantity now every conception

must indeed be considered as a representation which is contained in an infinite

multitude of different possible representations which therefore comprises

these under itself but no conception as such can be so conceived as if it

contained within itself an infinite multitude of representations nevertheless

space is so conceived of for all parts of space are equally capable of being

produced to infinity consequently the original representation of space is an

intuition  priori and not a conception


 3 transcendental exposition of the conception of

space


by a transcendental exposition i mean the explanation of a conception as a

principle whence can be discerned the possibility of other synthetical 

priori cognitions for this purpose it is requisite firstly that such

cognitions do really flow from the given conception and secondly that the

said cognitions are only possible under the presupposition of a given mode of

explaining this conception




geometry is a science which determines the properties of space synthetically

and yet  priori what then must be our representation of space in order

that such a cognition of it may be possible it must be originally intuition

for from a mere conception no propositions can be deduced which go out beyond

the conception and yet this happens in geometry introd v but this

intuition must be found in the mind  priori that is before any perception of

objects consequently must be pure not empirical intuition for geometrical

principles are always apodeictic that is united with the consciousness of

their necessity as space has only three dimensions but

propositions of this kind cannot be empirical judgements nor conclusions from

them introd ii now how can an external intuition anterior to objects

themselves and in which our conception of objects can be determined  priori

exist in the human mind obviously not otherwise than in so far as it has its

seat in the subject only as the formal capacity of the subjects being

affected by objects and thereby of obtaining immediate representation that

is intuition consequently only as the form of the external sense in general




thus it is only by means of our explanation that the possibility of geometry

as a synthetical science  priori becomes comprehensible every mode of

explanation which does not show us this possibility although in appearance it

may be similar to ours can with the utmost certainty be distinguished from it

by these marks


 4 conclusions from the foregoing conceptions


a space does not represent any property of objects as things in themselves

nor does it represent them in their relations to each other in other words

space does not represent to us any determination of objects such as attaches to

the objects themselves and would remain even though all subjective conditions

of the intuition were abstracted for neither absolute nor relative

determinations of objects can be intuited prior to the existence of the things

to which they belong and therefore not  priori




b space is nothing else than the form of all phenomena of the external sense

that is the subjective condition of the sensibility under which alone

external intuition is possible now because the receptivity or capacity of the

subject to be affected by objects necessarily antecedes all intuitions of these

objects it is easily understood how the form of all phenomena can be given in

the mind previous to all actual perceptions therefore  priori and how it as

a pure intuition in which all objects must be determined can contain

principles of the relations of these objects prior to all experience




it is therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak of space

extended objects etc if we depart from the subjective condition under which

alone we can obtain external intuition or in other words by means of which

we are affected by objects the representation of space has no meaning

whatsoever this predicate is only applicable to things in so far as they

appear to us that is are objects of sensibility the constant form of this

receptivity which we call sensibility is a necessary condition of all

relations in which objects can be intuited as existing without us and when

abstraction of these objects is made is a pure intuition to which we give the

name of space it is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of

sensibility into conditions of the possibility of things but only of the

possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena and so we may

correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us externally but

not all things considered as things in themselves be they intuited or not or

by whatsoever subject one will as to the intuitions of other thinking beings

we cannot judge whether they are or are not bound by the same conditions which

limit our own intuition and which for us are universally valid if we join the

limitation of a judgement to the conception of the subject then the judgement

will possess unconditioned validity for example the proposition all

objects are beside each other in space is valid only under the

limitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuous intuition

but if i join the condition to the conception and say all things as

external phenomena are beside each other in space then the rule is

valid universally and without any limitation our expositions consequently

teach the reality ie the objective validity of space in regard of all

which can be presented to us externally as object and at the same time also

the ideality of space in regard to objects when they are considered by means of

reason as things in themselves that is without reference to the constitution

of our sensibility we maintain therefore the empirical reality of space in

regard to all possible external experience although we must admit its

transcendental ideality in other words that it is nothing so soon as we

withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of all experience depends and

look upon space as something that belongs to things in themselves




but with the exception of space there is no representation subjective and

referring to something external to us which could be called objective 

priori for there are no other subjective representations from which we can

deduce synthetical propositions  priori as we can from the intuition of

space see  3 therefore to speak accurately no ideality whatever belongs

to these although they agree in this respect with the representation of space

that they belong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous

perception such a mode for example as that of sight of hearing and of

feeling by means of the sensations of colour sound and heat but which

because they are only sensations and not intuitions do not of themselves give

us the cognition of any object least of all an  priori cognition my

purpose in the above remark is merely this to guard any one against

illustrating the asserted ideality of space by examples quite insufficient for

example by colour taste etc for these must be contemplated not as

properties of things but only as changes in the subject changes which may be

different in different men for in such a case that which is originally a

mere phenomenon a rose for example is taken by the empirical understanding

for a thing in itself though to every different eye in respect of its colour

it may appear different on the contrary the transcendental conception of

phenomena in space is a critical admonition that in general nothing which is

intuited in space is a thing in itself and that space is not a form which

belongs as a property to things but that objects are quite unknown to us in

themselves and what we call outward objects are nothing else but mere

representations of our sensibility whose form is space but whose real

correlate the thing in itself is not known by means of these representations

nor ever can be but respecting which in experience no inquiry is ever made


section ii of time
 5 metaphysical exposition of this conception


1 time is not an empirical conception for neither coexistence nor succession

would be perceived by us if the representation of time did not exist as a

foundation  priori without this presupposition we could not represent to

ourselves that things exist together at one and the same time or at different

times that is contemporaneously or in succession




2 time is a necessary representation lying at the foundation of all our

intuitions with regard to phenomena in general we cannot think away time from

them and represent them to ourselves as out of and unconnected with time but

we can quite well represent to ourselves time void of phenomena time is

therefore given  priori in it alone is all reality of phenomena possible

these may all be annihilated in thought but time itself as the universal

condition of their possibility cannot be so annulled




3 on this necessity  priori is also founded the possibility of apodeictic

principles of the relations of time or axioms of time in general such as

time has only one dimension different times are not

coexistent but successive as different spaces are not successive but

coexistent these principles cannot be derived from experience for it would

give neither strict universality nor apodeictic certainty we should only be

able to say so common experience teaches us but not it

must be so they are valid as rules through which in general

experience is possible and they instruct us respecting experience and not by

means of it




4 time is not a discursive or as it is called general conception but a pure

form of the sensuous intuition different times are merely parts of one and the

same time but the representation which can only be given by a single object is

an intuition besides the proposition that different times cannot be

coexistent could not be derived from a general conception for this proposition

is synthetical and therefore cannot spring out of conceptions alone it is

therefore contained immediately in the intuition and representation of time




5 the infinity of time signifies nothing more than that every determined

quantity of time is possible only through limitations of one time lying at the

foundation consequently the original representation time must be given as

unlimited but as the determinate representation of the parts of time and of

every quantity of an object can only be obtained by limitation the complete

representation of time must not be furnished by means of conceptions for these

contain only partial representations conceptions on the contrary must have

immediate intuition for their basis


 6 transcendental exposition of the conception of

time


i may here refer to what is said above  5 3 where for or sake of brevity

i have placed under the head of metaphysical exposition that which is properly

transcendental here i shall add that the conception of change and with it the

conception of motion as change of place is possible only through and in the

representation of time that if this representation were not an intuition

internal  priori no conception of whatever kind could render

comprehensible the possibility of change in other words of a conjunction of

contradictorily opposed predicates in one and the same object for example the

presence of a thing in a place and the nonpresence of the same thing in the

same place it is only in time that it is possible to meet with two

contradictorily opposed determinations in one thing that is after each other

thus our conception of time explains the possibility of so much synthetical

knowledge  priori as is exhibited in the general doctrine of motion which is

not a little fruitful


 7 conclusions from the above conceptions


a time is not something which subsists of itself or which inheres in things

as an objective determination and therefore remains when abstraction is made

of the subjective conditions of the intuition of things for in the former

case it would be something real yet without presenting to any power of

perception any real object in the latter case as an order or determination

inherent in things themselves it could not be antecedent to things as their

condition nor discerned or intuited by means of synthetical propositions 

priori but all this is quite possible when we regard time as merely the

subjective condition under which all our intuitions take place for in that

case this form of the inward intuition can be represented prior to the

objects and consequently  priori




b time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense that is of the

intuitions of self and of our internal state for time cannot be any

determination of outward phenomena it has to do neither with shape nor

position on the contrary it determines the relation of representations in our

internal state and precisely because this internal intuition presents to us no

shape or form we endeavour to supply this want by analogies and represent the

course of time by a line progressing to infinity the content of which

constitutes a series which is only of one dimension and we conclude from the

properties of this line as to all the properties of time with this single

exception that the parts of the line are coexistent whilst those of time are

successive from this it is clear also that the representation of time is

itself an intuition because all its relations can be expressed in an external

intuition




c time is the formal condition  priori of all phenomena whatsoever space

as the pure form of external intuition is limited as a condition  priori to

external phenomena alone on the other hand because all representations

whether they have or have not external things for their objects still in

themselves as determinations of the mind belong to our internal state and

because this internal state is subject to the formal condition of the internal

intuition that is to timetime is a condition  priori of all phenomena

whatsoeverthe immediate condition of all internal and thereby the

mediate condition of all external phenomena if i can say  priori all

outward phenomena are in space and determined  priori according to the

relations of space i can also from the principle of the internal

sense affirm universally all phenomena in general that is all

objects of the senses are in time and stand necessarily in relations of

time




if we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external intuitions

possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and presented to us by our

faculty of representation and consequently take objects as they are in

themselves then time is nothing it is only of objective validity in regard to

phenomena because these are things which we regard as objects of our senses

it no longer objective we make abstraction of the sensuousness of our

intuition in other words of that mode of representation which is peculiar to

us and speak of things in general time is therefore merely a subjective

condition of our human intuition which is always sensuous that is so far

as we are affected by objects and in itself independently of the mind or

subject is nothing nevertheless in respect of all phenomena consequently of

all things which come within the sphere of our experience it is necessarily

objective we cannot say all things are in time because in this

conception of things in general we abstract and make no mention of any sort of

intuition of things but this is the proper condition under which time belongs

to our representation of objects if we add the condition to the conception

and say all things as phenomena that is objects of sensuous

intuition are in time then the proposition has its sound objective

validity and universality  priori




what we have now set forth teaches therefore the empirical reality of time

that is its objective validity in reference to all objects which can ever be

presented to our senses and as our intuition is always sensuous no object

ever can be presented to us in experience which does not come under the

conditions of time on the other hand we deny to time all claim to absolute

reality that is we deny that it without having regard to the form of our

sensuous intuition absolutely inheres in things as a condition or property

such properties as belong to objects as things in themselves never can be

presented to us through the medium of the senses herein consists therefore

the transcendental ideality of time according to which if we abstract the

subjective conditions of sensuous intuition it is nothing and cannot be

reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in themselves

independently of its relation to our intuition this ideality like that of

space is not to be proved or illustrated by fallacious analogies with

sensations for this reasonthat in such arguments or illustrations we

make the presupposition that the phenomenon in which such and such predicates

inhere has objective reality while in this case we can only find such an

objective reality as is itself empirical that is regards the object as a mere

phenomenon in reference to this subject see the remark in section i  4


 8 elucidation


against this theory which grants empirical reality to time but denies to it

absolute and transcendental reality i have heard from intelligent men an

objection so unanimously urged that i conclude that it must naturally present

itself to every reader to whom these considerations are novel it runs thus

changes are real this the continual change in our own

representations demonstrates even though the existence of all external

phenomena together with their changes is denied now changes are only

possible in time and therefore time must be something real but there is no

difficulty in answering this i grant the whole argument time no doubt is

something real that is it is the real form of our internal intuition it

therefore has subjective reality in reference to our internal experience that

is i have really the representation of time and of my determinations therein

time therefore is not to be regarded as an object but as the mode of

representation of myself as an object but if i could intuite myself or be

intuited by another being without this condition of sensibility then those

very determinations which we now represent to ourselves as changes would

present to us a knowledge in which the representation of time and consequently

of change would not appear the empirical reality of time therefore remains

as the condition of all our experience but absolute reality according to what

has been said above cannot be granted it time is nothing but the form of our

internal intuition11 if we take away from it the special

condition of our sensibility the conception of time also vanishes and it

inheres not in the objects themselves but solely in the subject or mind

which intuites them



 11

i can indeed say my representations follow one another or are

successive but this means only that we are conscious of them as in a

succession that is according to the form of the internal sense time

therefore is not a thing in itself nor is it any objective determination

pertaining to or inherent in things




but the reason why this objection is so unanimously brought against our

doctrine of time and that too by disputants who cannot start any intelligible

arguments against the doctrine of the ideality of space is thisthey

have no hope of demonstrating apodeictically the absolute reality of space

because the doctrine of idealism is against them according to which the

reality of external objects is not capable of any strict proof on the other

hand the reality of the object of our internal sense that is myself and my

internal state is clear immediately through consciousness the

formerexternal objects in spacemight be a mere delusion but the

latterthe object of my internal perceptionis undeniably real

they do not however reflect that both without question of their reality as

representations belong only to the genus phenomenon which has always two

aspects the one the object considered as a thing in itself without regard to

the mode of intuiting it and the nature of which remains for this very reason

problematical the other the form of our intuition of the object which must

be sought not in the object as a thing in itself but in the subject to which

it appearswhich form of intuition nevertheless belongs really and

necessarily to the phenomenal object




time and space are therefore two sources of knowledge from which  priori

various synthetical cognitions can be drawn of this we find a striking example

in the cognitions of space and its relations which form the foundation of pure

mathematics they are the two pure forms of all intuitions and thereby make

synthetical propositions  priori possible but these sources of knowledge

being merely conditions of our sensibility do therefore and as such strictly

determine their own range and purpose in that they do not and cannot present

objects as things in themselves but are applicable to them solely in so far as

they are considered as sensuous phenomena the sphere of phenomena is the only

sphere of their validity and if we venture out of this no further objective

use can be made of them for the rest this formal reality of time and space

leaves the validity of our empirical knowledge unshaken for our certainty in

that respect is equally firm whether these forms necessarily inhere in the

things themselves or only in our intuitions of them on the other hand those

who maintain the absolute reality of time and space whether as essentially

subsisting or only inhering as modifications in things must find themselves

at utter variance with the principles of experience itself for if they decide

for the first view and make space and time into substances this being the

side taken by mathematical natural philosophers they must admit two

selfsubsisting nonentities infinite and eternal which exist yet without

there being anything real for the purpose of containing in themselves

everything that is real if they adopt the second view of inherence which is

preferred by some metaphysical natural philosophers and regard space and time

as relations contiguity in space or succession in time abstracted from

experience though represented confusedly in this state of separation they

find themselves in that case necessitated to deny the validity of mathematical

doctrines  priori in reference to real things for example in spaceat

all events their apodeictic certainty for such certainty cannot be found in an

 posteriori proposition and the conceptions  priori of space and time are

according to this opinion mere creations of the imagination having their

source really in experience inasmuch as out of relations abstracted from

experience imagination has made up something which contains indeed general

statements of these relations yet of which no application can be made without

the restrictions attached thereto by nature the former of these parties gains

this advantage that they keep the sphere of phenomena free for mathematical

science on the other hand these very conditions space and time embarrass

them greatly when the understanding endeavours to pass the limits of that

sphere the latter has indeed this advantage that the representations of

space and time do not come in their way when they wish to judge of objects not

as phenomena but merely in their relation to the understanding devoid

however of a true and objectively valid  priori intuition they can neither

furnish any basis for the possibility of mathematical cognitions  priori nor

bring the propositions of experience into necessary accordance with those of

mathematics in our theory of the true nature of these two original forms of

the sensibility both difficulties are surmounted




in conclusion that transcendental sthetic cannot contain any more than these

two elementsspace and time is sufficiently obvious from the fact that

all other conceptions appertaining to sensibility even that of motion which

unites in itself both elements presuppose something empirical motion for

example presupposes the perception of something movable but space considered

in itself contains nothing movable consequently motion must be something which

is found in space only through experiencein other words an empirical

datum in like manner transcendental sthetic cannot number the conception of

change among its data  priori for time itself does not change but only

something which is in time to acquire the conception of change therefore the

perception of some existing object and of the succession of its determinations

in one word experience is necessary


 9 general remarks on transcendental sthetic


i in order to prevent any misunderstanding it will be requisite in the first

place to recapitulate as clearly as possible what our opinion is with

respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuous cognition in general we have

intended then to say that all our intuition is nothing but the representation

of phenomena that the things which we intuite are not in themselves the same

as our representations of them in intuition nor are their relations in

themselves so constituted as they appear to us and that if we take away the

subject or even only the subjective constitution of our senses in general

then not only the nature and relations of objects in space and time but even

space and time themselves disappear and that these as phenomena cannot exist

in themselves but only in us what may be the nature of objects considered as

things in themselves and without reference to the receptivity of our

sensibility is quite unknown to us we know nothing more than our mode of

perceiving them which is peculiar to us and which though not of necessity

pertaining to every animated being is so to the whole human race with this

alone we have to do space and time are the pure forms thereof sensation the

matter the former alone can we cognize  priori that is antecedent to all

actual perception and for this reason such cognition is called pure intuition

the latter is that in our cognition which is called cognition  posteriori

that is empirical intuition the former appertain absolutely and necessarily

to our sensibility of whatsoever kind our sensations may be the latter may be

of very diversified character supposing that we should carry our empirical

intuition even to the very highest degree of clearness we should not thereby

advance one step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of objects as things

in themselves for we could only at best arrive at a complete cognition of

our own mode of intuition that is of our sensibility and this always under

the conditions originally attaching to the subject namely the conditions of

space and time while the question what are objects considered as

things in themselves remains unanswerable even after the most thorough

examination of the phenomenal world




to say then that all our sensibility is nothing but the confused

representation of things containing exclusively that which belongs to them as

things in themselves and this under an accumulation of characteristic marks

and partial representations which we cannot distinguish in consciousness is a

falsification of the conception of sensibility and phenomenization which

renders our whole doctrine thereof empty and useless the difference between a

confused and a clear representation is merely logical and has nothing to do

with content no doubt the conception of right as employed by a sound

understanding contains all that the most subtle investigation could unfold

from it although in the ordinary practical use of the word we are not

conscious of the manifold representations comprised in the conception but we

cannot for this reason assert that the ordinary conception is a sensuous one

containing a mere phenomenon for right cannot appear as a phenomenon but the

conception of it lies in the understanding and represents a property the

moral property of actions which belongs to them in themselves on the other

hand the representation in intuition of a body contains nothing which could

belong to an object considered as a thing in itself but merely the phenomenon

or appearance of something and the mode in which we are affected by that

appearance and this receptivity of our faculty of cognition is called

sensibility and remains toto caelo different from the cognition of an object

in itself even though we should examine the content of the phenomenon to the

very bottom




it must be admitted that the leibnitzwolfian philosophy has assigned an

entirely erroneous point of view to all investigations into the nature and

origin of our cognitions inasmuch as it regards the distinction between the

sensuous and the intellectual as merely logical whereas it is plainly

transcendental and concerns not merely the clearness or obscurity but the

content and origin of both for the faculty of sensibility not only does not

present us with an indistinct and confused cognition of objects as things in

themselves but in fact gives us no knowledge of these at all on the

contrary so soon as we abstract in thought our own subjective nature the

object represented with the properties ascribed to it by sensuous intuition

entirely disappears because it was only this subjective nature that determined

the form of the object as a phenomenon




in phenomena we commonly indeed distinguish that which essentially belongs

to the intuition of them and is valid for the sensuous faculty of every human

being from that which belongs to the same intuition accidentally as valid not

for the sensuous faculty in general but for a particular state or organization

of this or that sense accordingly we are accustomed to say that the former is

a cognition which represents the object itself whilst the latter presents only

a particular appearance or phenomenon thereof this distinction however is

only empirical if we stop here as is usual and do not regard the empirical

intuition as itself a mere phenomenon as we ought to do in which nothing

that can appertain to a thing in itself is to be found our transcendental

distinction is lost and we believe that we cognize objects as things in

themselves although in the whole range of the sensuous world investigate the

nature of its objects as profoundly as we may we have to do with nothing but

phenomena thus we call the rainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny

shower and the rain the reality or thing in itself and this is right enough

if we understand the latter conception in a merely physical sense that is as

that which in universal experience and under whatever conditions of sensuous

perception is known in intuition to be so and so determined and not

otherwise but if we consider this empirical datum generally and inquire

without reference to its accordance with all our senses whether there can be

discovered in it aught which represents an object as a thing in itself the

raindrops of course are not such for they are as phenomena empirical

objects the question of the relation of the representation to the object is

transcendental and not only are the raindrops mere phenomena but even their

circular form nay the space itself through which they fall is nothing in

itself but both are mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our

sensuous intuition whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterly

unknown




the second important concern of our sthetic is that it does not obtain favour

merely as a plausible hypothesis but possess as undoubted a character of

certainty as can be demanded of any theory which is to serve for an organon in

order fully to convince the reader of this certainty we shall select a case

which will serve to make its validity apparent and also to illustrate what has

been said in  3




suppose then that space and time are in themselves objective and conditions

of thepossibility of objects as things in themselves in the first

place it is evident that both present us with very many apodeictic and

synthetic propositions  priori but especially spaceand for this reason

we shall prefer it for investigation at present as the propositions of

geometry are cognized synthetically  priori and with apodeictic certainty i

inquire whence do you obtain propositions of this kind and on what basis does

the understanding rest in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and

universally valid truths




there is no other way than through intuitions or conceptions as such and

these are given either  priori or  posteriori the latter namely empirical

conceptions together with the empirical intuition on which they are founded

cannot afford any synthetical proposition except such as is itself also

empirical that is a proposition of experience but an empirical proposition

cannot possess the qualities of necessity and absolute universality which

nevertheless are the characteristics of all geometrical propositions as to

the first and only means to arrive at such cognitions namely through mere

conceptions or intuitions  priori it is quite clear that from mere

conceptions no synthetical cognitions but only analytical ones can be

obtained take for example the proposition two straight lines cannot

enclose a space and with these alone no figure is possible and try to

deduce it from the conception of a straight line and the number two or take

the proposition it is possible to construct a figure with three

straight lines and endeavour in like manner to deduce it from the

mere conception of a straight line and the number three all your endeavours

are in vain and you find yourself forced to have recourse to intuition as in

fact geometry always does you therefore give yourself an object in intuition

but of what kind is this intuition is it a pure  priori or is it an

empirical intuition if the latter then neither an universally valid much

less an apodeictic proposition can arise from it for experience never can give

us any such proposition you must therefore give yourself an object  priori

in intuition and upon that ground your synthetical proposition now if there

did not exist within you a faculty of intuition  priori if this subjective

condition were not in respect to its form also the universal condition  priori

under which alone the object of this external intuition is itself possible if

the object that is the triangle were something in itself without relation

to you the subject how could you affirm that that which lies necessarily in

your subjective conditions in order to construct a triangle must also

necessarily belong to the triangle in itself for to your conceptions of three

lines you could not add anything new that is the figure which therefore

must necessarily be found in the object because the object is given before

your cognition and not by means of it if therefore space and time also

were not a mere form of your intuition which contains conditions  priori

under which alone things can become external objects for you and without which

subjective conditions the objects are in themselves nothing you could not

construct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regarding external objects it

is therefore not merely possible or probable but indubitably certain that

space and time as the necessary conditions of all our external and internal

experience are merely subjective conditions of all our intuitions in relation

to which all objects are therefore mere phenomena and not things in

themselves presented to us in this particular manner and for this reason in

respect to the form of phenomena much may be said  priori whilst of the

thing in itself which may lie at the foundation of these phenomena it is

impossible to say anything




ii in confirmation of this theory of the ideality of the external as well as

internal sense consequently of all objects of sense as mere phenomena we may

especially remark that all in our cognition that belongs to intuition contains

nothing more than mere relations the feelings of pain and pleasure and the

will which are not cognitions are excepted the relations to wit of place

in an intuition extension change of place motion and laws according to

which this change is determined moving forces that however which is

present in this or that place or any operation going on or result taking

place in the things themselves with the exception of change of place is not

given to us by intuition now by means of mere relations a thing cannot be

known in itself and it may therefore be fairly concluded that as through the

external sense nothing but mere representations of relations are given us the

said external sense in its representation can contain only the relation of the

object to the subject but not the essential nature of the object as a thing in

itself




the same is the case with the internal intuition not only because in the

internal intuition the representation of the external senses constitutes the

material with which the mind is occupied but because time in which we place

and which itself antecedes the consciousness of these representations in

experience and which as the formal condition of the mode according to which

objects are placed in the mind lies at the foundation of them contains

relations of the successive the coexistent and of that which always must be

coexistent with succession the permanent now that which as representation

can antecede every exercise of thought of an object is intuition and when

it contains nothing but relations it is the form of the intuition which as

it presents us with no representation except in so far as something is placed

in the mind can be nothing else than the mode in which the mind is affected by

its own activity to witits presenting to itself representations

consequently the mode in which the mind is affected by itself that is it can

be nothing but an internal sense in respect to its form everything that is

represented through the medium of sense is so far phenomenal consequently we

must either refuse altogether to admit an internal sense or the subject which

is the object of that sense could only be represented by it as phenomenon and

not as it would judge of itself if its intuition were pure spontaneous

activity that is were intellectual the difficulty here lies wholly in the

question how can the subject have an internal intuition of itself but this

difficulty is common to every theory the consciousness of self apperception

is the simple representation of the ego and if by means of that

representation alone all the manifold representations in the subject were

spontaneously given then our internal intuition would be intellectual this

consciousness in man requires an internal perception of the manifold

representations which are previously given in the subject and the manner in

which these representations are given in the mind without spontaneity must on

account of this difference the want of spontaneity be called sensibility if

the faculty of selfconsciousness is to apprehend what lies in the mind it

must all act that and can in this way alone produce an intuition of self but

the form of this intuition which lies in the original constitution of the

mind determines in the representation of time the manner in which the

manifold representations are to combine themselves in the mind since the

subject intuites itself not as it would represent itself immediately and

spontaneously but according to the manner in which the mind is internally

affected consequently as it appears and not as it is




iii when we say that the intuition of external objects and also the

selfintuition of the subject represent both objects and subject in space

and time as they affect our senses that is as they appearthis is by

no means equivalent to asserting that these objects are mere illusory

appearances for when we speak of things as phenomena the objects nay even

the properties which we ascribe to them are looked upon as really given only

that in so far as this or that property depends upon the mode of intuition of

the subject in the relation of the given object to the subject the object as

phenomenon is to be distinguished from the object as a thing in itself thus i

do not say that bodies seem or appear to be external to me or that my soul

seems merely to be given in my selfconsciousness although i maintain that the

properties of space and time in conformity to which i set both as the

condition of their existence abide in my mode of intuition and not in the

objects in themselves it would be my own fault if out of that which i should

reckon as phenomenon i made mere illusory appearance12 but this will not

happen because of our principle of the ideality of all sensuous intuitions on

the contrary if we ascribe objective reality to these forms of representation

it becomes impossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance for if

we regard space and time as properties which must be found in objects as

things in themselves as sine quibus non of the possibility of their existence

and reflect on the absurdities in which we then find ourselves involved

inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existence of two infinite things

which are nevertheless not substances nor anything really inhering in

substances nay to admit that they are the necessary conditions of the

existence of all things and moreover that they must continue to exist

although all existing things were annihilatedwe cannot blame the good

berkeley for degrading bodies to mere illusory appearances nay even our own

existence which would in this case depend upon the selfexistent reality of

such a mere nonentity as time would necessarily be changed with it into mere

appearancean absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of



 12

the predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object itself in

relation to our sensuous faculty for example the red colour or the perfume to

the rose but illusory appearance never can be attributed as a predicate to

an object for this very reason that it attributes to this object in itself

that which belongs to it only in relation to our sensuous faculty or to the

subject in general eg the two handles which were formerly ascribed to

saturn that which is never to be found in the object itself but always in the

relation of the object to the subject and which moreover is inseparable from

our representation of the object we denominate phenomenon thus the predicates

of space and time are rightly attributed to objects of the senses as such and

in this there is no illusion on the contrary if i ascribe redness of the rose

as a thing in itself or to saturn his handles or extension to all external

objects considered as things in themselves without regarding the determinate

relation of these objects to the subject and without limiting my judgement to

that relationthen and then only arises illusion




iv in natural theology where we think of an objectgodwhich

never can be an object of intuition to us and even to himself can never be an

object of sensuous intuition we carefully avoid attributing to his intuition

the conditions of space and timeand intuition all his cognition must be

and not thought which always includes limitation but with what right can we

do this if we make them forms of objects as things in themselves and such

moreover as would continue to exist as  priori conditions of the existence of

things even though the things themselves were annihilated for as conditions

of all existence in general space and time must be conditions of the existence

of the supreme being also but if we do not thus make them objective forms of

all things there is no other way left than to make them subjective forms of

our mode of intuitionexternal and internal which is called sensuous

because it is not primitive that is is not such as gives in itself the

existence of the object of the intuition a mode of intuition which so far as

we can judge can belong only to the creator but is dependent on the

existence of the object is possible therefore only on condition that the

representative faculty of the subject is affected by the object




it is moreover not necessary that we should limit the mode of intuition in

space and time to the sensuous faculty of man it may well be that all finite

thinking beings must necessarily in this respect agree with man though as to

this we cannot decide but sensibility does not on account of this

universality cease to be sensibility for this very reason that it is a

deduced intuitus derivativus and not an original intuitus originarius

consequently not an intellectual intuition and this intuition as such for

reasons above mentioned seems to belong solely to the supreme being but never

to a being dependent quoad its existence as well as its intuition which its

existence determines and limits relatively to given objects this latter

remark however must be taken only as an illustration and not as any proof of

the truth of our sthetical theory


 10 conclusion of the transcendental sthetic


we have now completely before us one part of the solution of the grand general

problem of transcendental philosophy namely the question how are

synthetical propositions  priori possible that is to say we have

shown that we are in possession of pure  priori intuitions namely space and

time in which we find when in a judgement  priori we pass out beyond the

given conception something which is not discoverable in that conception but

is certainly found  priori in the intuition which corresponds to the

conception and can be united synthetically with it but the judgements which

these pure intuitions enable us to make never reach farther than to objects of

the senses and are valid only for objects of possible experience


second parttranscendental logic
introduction idea of a transcendental logic
i of logic in general


our knowledge springs from two main sources in the mind first of which is the

faculty or power of receiving representations receptivity for impressions

the second is the power of cognizing by means of these representations

spontaneity in the production of conceptions through the first an object is

given to us through the second it is in relation to the representation

which is a mere determination of the mind thought intuition and conceptions

constitute therefore the elements of all our knowledge so that neither

conceptions without an intuition in some way corresponding to them nor

intuition without conceptions can afford us a cognition both are either pure

or empirical they are empirical when sensation which presupposes the actual

presence of the object is contained in them and pure when no sensation is

mixed with the representation sensations we may call the matter of sensuous

cognition pure intuition consequently contains merely the form under which

something is intuited and pure conception only the form of the thought of an

object only pure intuitions and pure conceptions are possible  priori the

empirical only  posteriori




we apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind for impressions

in so far as it is in some way affected and on the other hand we call the

faculty of spontaneously producing representations or the spontaneity of

cognition understanding our nature is so constituted that intuition with us

never can be other than sensuous that is it contains only the mode in which

we are affected by objects on the other hand the faculty of thinking the

object of sensuous intuition is the understanding neither of these faculties

has a preference over the other without the sensuous faculty no object would

be given to us and without the understanding no object would be thought

thoughts without content are void intuitions without conceptions blind hence

it is as necessary for the mind to make its conceptions sensuous that is to

join to them the object in intuition as to make its intuitions intelligible

that is to bring them under conceptions neither of these faculties can

exchange its proper function understanding cannot intuite and the sensuous

faculty cannot think in no other way than from the united operation of both

can knowledge arise but no one ought on this account to overlook the

difference of the elements contributed by each we have rather great reason

carefully to separate and distinguish them we therefore distinguish the

science of the laws of sensibility that is sthetic from the science of the

laws of the understanding that is logic




now logic in its turn may be considered as twofoldnamely as logic of

the general or of the particular use of the understanding the first contains

the absolutely necessary laws of thought without which no use whatsoever of

the understanding is possible and gives laws therefore to the understanding

without regard to the difference of objects on which it may be employed the

logic of the particular use of the understanding contains the laws of correct

thinking upon a particular class of objects the former may be called elemental

logicthe latter the organon of this or that particular science the

latter is for the most part employed in the schools as a propdeutic to the

sciences although indeed according to the course of human reason it is the

last thing we arrive at when the science has been already matured and needs

only the finishing touches towards its correction and completion for our

knowledge of the objects of our attempted science must be tolerably extensive

and complete before we can indicate the laws by which a science of these

objects can be established




general logic is again either pure or applied in the former we abstract all

the empirical conditions under which the understanding is exercised for

example the influence of the senses the play of the fantasy or imagination

the laws of the memory the force of habit of inclination etc consequently

also the sources of prejudicein a word we abstract all causes from

which particular cognitions arise because these causes regard the

understanding under certain circumstances of its application and to the

knowledge of them experience is required pure general logic has to do

therefore merely with pure  priori principles and is a canon of

understanding and reason but only in respect of the formal part of their use

be the content what it may empirical or transcendental general logic is

called applied when it is directed to the laws of the use of the

understanding under the subjective empirical conditions which psychology

teaches us it has therefore empirical principles although at the same time

it is in so far general that it applies to the exercise of the understanding

without regard to the difference of objects on this account moreover it is

neither a canon of the understanding in general nor an organon of a particular

science but merely a cathartic of the human understanding




in general logic therefore that part which constitutes pure logic must be

carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied though still

general logic the former alone is properly science although short and dry

as the methodical exposition of an elemental doctrine of the understanding

ought to be in this therefore logicians must always bear in mind two rules




1 as general logic it makes abstraction of all content of the cognition of

the understanding and of the difference of objects and has to do with nothing

but the mere form of thought




2 as pure logic it has no empirical principles and consequently draws

nothing contrary to the common persuasion from psychology which therefore

has no influence on the canon of the understanding it is a demonstrated

doctrine and everything in it must be certain completely  priori




what i called applied logic contrary to the common acceptation of this term

according to which it should contain certain exercises for the scholar for

which pure logic gives the rules is a representation of the understanding

and of the rules of its necessary employment in concreto that is to say under

the accidental conditions of the subject which may either hinder or promote

this employment and which are all given only empirically thus applied logic

treats of attention its impediments and consequences of the origin of error

of the state of doubt hesitation conviction etc and to it is related pure

general logic in the same way that pure morality which contains only the

necessary moral laws of a free will is related to practical ethics which

considers these laws under all the impediments of feelings inclinations and

passions to which men are more or less subjected and which never can furnish

us with a true and demonstrated science because it as well as applied logic

requires empirical and psychological principles


ii of transcendental logic


general logic as we have seen makes abstraction of all content of cognition

that is of all relation of cognition to its object and regards only the

logical form in the relation of cognitions to each other that is the form of

thought in general but as we have both pure and empirical intuitions as

transcendental sthetic proves in like manner a distinction might be drawn

between pure and empirical thought of objects in this case there would

exist a kind of logic in which we should not make abstraction of all content

of cognition for or logic which should comprise merely the laws of pure

thought of an object would of course exclude all those cognitions which were

of empirical content this kind of logic would also examine the origin of our

cognitions of objects so far as that origin cannot be ascribed to the objects

themselves while on the contrary general logic has nothing to do with the

origin of our cognitions but contemplates our representations be they given

primitively  priori in ourselves or be they only of empirical origin solely

according to the laws which the understanding observes in employing them in the

process of thought in relation to each other consequently general logic

treats of the form of the understanding only which can be applied to

representations from whatever source they may have arisen




and here i shall make a remark which the reader must bear well in mind in the

course of the following considerations to wit that not every cognition 

priori but only those through which we cognize that and how certain

representations intuitions or conceptions are applied or are possible only 

priori that is to say the  priori possibility of cognition and the  priori

use of it are transcendental therefore neither is space nor any  priori

geometrical determination of space a transcendental representation but only

the knowledge that such a representation is not of empirical origin and the

possibility of its relating to objects of experience although itself  priori

can be called transcendental so also the application of space to objects in

general would be transcendental but if it be limited to objects of sense it is

empirical thus the distinction of the transcendental and empirical belongs

only to the critique of cognitions and does not concern the relation of these

to their object




accordingly in the expectation that there may perhaps be conceptions which

relate  priori to objects not as pure or sensuous intuitions but merely as

acts of pure thought which are therefore conceptions but neither of empirical

nor sthetical originin this expectation i say we form to ourselves

by anticipation the idea of a science of pure understanding and rational

cognition by means of which we may cogitate objects entirely  priori a

science of this kind which should determine the origin the extent and the

objective validity of such cognitions must be called transcendental logic

because it has not like general logic to do with the laws of understanding

and reason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitions without

distinction but concerns itself with these only in an  priori relation to

objects


iii of the division of general logic into analytic

and dialectic


the old question with which people sought to push logicians into a corner so

that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophisms or confess their

ignorance and consequently the vanity of their whole art is this what

is truth the definition of the word truth to wit the

accordance of the cognition with its object is presupposed in the

question but we desire to be told in the answer to it what is the universal

and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition




to know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strong evidence

of sagacity and intelligence for if a question be in itself absurd and

unsusceptible of a rational answer it is attended with the dangernot to

mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposes itof seducing

the unguarded listener into making absurd answers and we are presented with

the ridiculous spectacle of one as the ancients said milking the

hegoat and the other holding a sieve




if truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object this object

must be ipso facto distinguished from all others for a cognition is false if

it does not accord with the object to which it relates although it contains

something which may be affirmed of other objects now an universal criterion of

truth would be that which is valid for all cognitions without distinction of

their objects but it is evident that since in the case of such a criterion

we make abstraction of all the content of a cognition that is of all relation

to its object and truth relates precisely to this content it must be utterly

absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content of cognition and that

accordingly a sufficient and at the same time universal test of truth cannot

possibly be found as we have already termed the content of a cognition its

matter we shall say of the truth of our cognitions in respect of their

matter no universal test can be demanded because such a demand is

selfcontradictory




on the other hand with regard to our cognition in respect of its mere form

excluding all content it is equally manifest that logic in so far as it

exhibits the universal and necessary laws of the understanding must in these

very laws present us with criteria of truth whatever contradicts these rules

is false because thereby the understanding is made to contradict its own

universal laws of thought that is to contradict itself these criteria

however apply solely to the form of truth that is of thought in general and

in so far they are perfectly accurate yet not sufficient for although a

cognition may be perfectly accurate as to logical form that is not

selfcontradictory it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may not stand

in agreement with its object consequently the merely logical criterion of

truth namely the accordance of a cognition with the universal and formal laws

of understanding and reason is nothing more than the conditio sine qua non or

negative condition of all truth farther than this logic cannot go and the

error which depends not on the form but on the content of the cognition it

has no test to discover




general logic then resolves the whole formal business of understanding and

reason into its elements and exhibits them as principles of all logical

judging of our cognitions this part of logic may therefore be called

analytic and is at least the negative test of truth because all cognitions

must first of an be estimated and tried according to these laws before we

proceed to investigate them in respect of their content in order to discover

whether they contain positive truth in regard to their object because

however the mere form of a cognition accurately as it may accord with logical

laws is insufficient to supply us with material objective truth no one by

means of logic alone can venture to predicate anything of or decide concerning

objects unless he has obtained independently of logic wellgrounded

information about them in order afterwards to examine according to logical

laws into the use and connection in a cohering whole of that information

or what is still better merely to test it by them notwithstanding there

lies so seductive a charm in the possession of a specious art like

thisan art which gives to all our cognitions the form of the

understanding although with respect to the content thereof we may be sadly

deficientthat general logic which is merely a canon of judgement has

been employed as an organon for the actual production or rather for the

semblance of production of objective assertions and has thus been grossly

misapplied now general logic in its assumed character of organon is called

dialectic




different as are the significations in which the ancients used this term for a

science or an art we may safely infer from their actual employment of it

that with them it was nothing else than a logic of illusiona sophistical

art for giving ignorance nay even intentional sophistries the colouring of

truth in which the thoroughness of procedure which logic requires was

imitated and their topic employed to cloak the empty pretensions now it may

be taken as a safe and useful warning that general logic considered as an

organon must always be a logic of illusion that is be dialectical for as

it teaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions but

merely the formal conditions of their accordance with the understanding which

do not relate to and are quite indifferent in respect of objects any attempt

to employ it as an instrument organon in order to extend and enlarge the

range of our knowledge must end in mere prating any one being able to maintain

or oppose with some appearance of truth any single assertion whatever




such instruction is quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy for these

reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logic dialectic in the sense

of a critique of dialectical illusion and we wish the term to be so understood

in this place


iv of the division of transcendental logic into

transcendental analytic and dialectic


in transcendental logic we isolate the understanding as in transcendental

sthetic the sensibility and select from our cognition merely that part of

thought which has its origin in the understanding alone the exercise of this

pure cognition however depends upon this as its condition that objects to

which it may be applied be given to us in intuition for without intuition the

whole of our cognition is without objects and is therefore quite void that

part of transcendental logic then which treats of the elements of pure

cognition of the understanding and of the principles without which no object

at all can be thought is transcendental analytic and at the same time a logic

of truth for no cognition can contradict it without losing at the same time

all content that is losing all reference to an object and therefore all

truth but because we are very easily seduced into employing these pure

cognitions and principles of the understanding by themselves and that even

beyond the boundaries of experience which yet is the only source whence we can

obtain matter objects on which those pure conceptions may be

employedunderstanding runs the risk of making by means of empty

sophisms a material and objective use of the mere formal principles of the

pure understanding and of passing judgements on objects without

distinctionobjects which are not given to us nay perhaps cannot be

given to us in any way now as it ought properly to be only a canon for

judging of the empirical use of the understanding this kind of logic is

misused when we seek to employ it as an organon of the universal and unlimited

exercise of the understanding and attempt with the pure understanding alone to

judge synthetically affirm and determine respecting objects in general in

this case the exercise of the pure understanding becomes dialectical the

second part of our transcendental logic must therefore be a critique of

dialectical illusion and this critique we shall term transcendental

dialecticnot meaning it as an art of producing dogmatically such

illusion an art which is unfortunately too current among the practitioners of

metaphysical juggling but as a critique of understanding and reason in regard

to their hyperphysical use this critique will expose the groundless nature of

the pretensions of these two faculties and invalidate their claims to the

discovery and enlargement of our cognitions merely by means of transcendental

principles and show that the proper employment of these faculties is to test

the judgements made by the pure understanding and to guard it from sophistical

delusion


first division transcendental logic transcendental

analytic  1


transcendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our  priori

knowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding in

order to effect our purpose it is necessary 1 that the conceptions be pure

and not empirical 2 that they belong not to intuition and sensibility but

to thought and understanding 3 that they be elementary conceptions and as

such quite different from deduced or compound conceptions 4 that our table

of these elementary conceptions be complete and fill up the whole sphere of

the pure understanding now this completeness of a science cannot be accepted

with confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of its existence in an

aggregate formed only by means of repeated experiments and attempts the

completeness which we require is possible only by means of an idea of the

totality of the  priori cognition of the understanding and through the

thereby determined division of the conceptions which form the said whole

consequently only by means of their connection in a system pure understanding

distinguishes itself not merely from everything empirical but also completely

from all sensibility it is a unity selfsubsistent selfsufficient and not

to be enlarged by any additions from without hence the sum of its cognition

constitutes a system to be determined by and comprised under an idea and the

completeness and articulation of this system can at the same time serve as a

test of the correctness and genuineness of all the parts of cognition that

belong to it the whole of this part of transcendental logic consists of two

books of which the one contains the conceptions and the other the principles

of pure understanding


book i analytic of conceptions  2


by the term analytic of conceptions i do not understand the analysis of these

or the usual process in philosophical investigations of dissecting the

conceptions which present themselves according to their content and so making

them clear but i mean the hitherto little attempted dissection of the faculty

of understanding itself in order to investigate the possibility of conceptions

 priori by looking for them in the understanding alone as their birthplace

and analysing the pure use of this faculty for this is the proper duty of a

transcendental philosophy what remains is the logical treatment of the

conceptions in philosophy in general we shall therefore follow up the pure

conceptions even to their germs and beginnings in the human understanding in

which they lie until they are developed on occasions presented by experience

and freed by the same understanding from the empirical conditions attaching to

them are set forth in their unalloyed purity


chapter i of the transcendental clue to the discovery

of all pure  conceptions of the understanding
introductory  3


when we call into play a faculty of cognition different conceptions manifest

themselves according to the different circumstances and make known this

faculty and assemble themselves into a more or less extensive collection

according to the time or penetration that has been applied to the consideration

of them where this process conducted as it is mechanically so to speak will

end cannot be determined with certainty besides the conceptions which we

discover in this haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order and

systematic unity but are at last coupled together only according to

resemblances to each other and arranged in series according to the quantity

of their content from the simpler to the more complexseries which are

anything but systematic though not altogether without a certain kind of method

in their construction




transcendental philosophy has the advantage and moreover the duty of

searching for its conceptions according to a principle because these

conceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as an absolute

unity and therefore must be connected with each other according to one

conception or idea a connection of this kind however furnishes us with a

ready prepared rule by which its proper place may be assigned to every pure

conception of the understanding and the completeness of the system of all be

determined  prioriboth which would otherwise have been dependent on

mere choice or chance


section i of the logical use of the understanding in

general  4


the understanding was defined above only negatively as a nonsensuous faculty

of cognition now independently of sensibility we cannot possibly have any

intuition consequently the understanding is no faculty of intuition but

besides intuition there is no other mode of cognition except through

conceptions consequently the cognition of every at least of every human

understanding is a cognition through conceptionsnot intuitive but

discursive all intuitions as sensuous depend on affections conceptions

therefore upon functions by the word function i understand the unity of the

act of arranging diverse representations under one common representation

conceptions then are based on the spontaneity of thought as sensuous

intuitions are on the receptivity of impressions now the understanding cannot

make any other use of these conceptions than to judge by means of them as no

representation except an intuition relates immediately to its object a

conception never relates immediately to an object but only to some other

representation thereof be that an intuition or itself a conception a

judgement therefore is the mediate cognition of an object consequently the

representation of a representation of it in every judgement there is a

conception which applies to and is valid for many other conceptions and which

among these comprehends also a given representation this last being

immediately connected with an object for example in the

judgementall bodies are divisible our conception of

divisible applies to various other conceptions among these however it is

here particularly applied to the conception of body and this conception of

body relates to certain phenomena which occur to us these objects therefore

are mediately represented by the conception of divisibility all judgements

accordingly are functions of unity in our representations inasmuch as

instead of an immediate a higher representation which comprises this and

various others is used for our cognition of the object and thereby many

possible cognitions are collected into one but we can reduce all acts of the

understanding to judgements so that understanding may be represented as the

faculty of judging for it is according to what has been said above a faculty

of thought now thought is cognition by means of conceptions but conceptions

as predicates of possible judgements relate to some representation of a yet

undetermined object thus the conception of body indicates somethingfor

example metalwhich can be cognized by means of that conception it is

therefore a conception for the reason alone that other representations are

contained under it by means of which it can relate to objects it is therefore

the predicate to a possible judgement for example every metal is a

body all the functions of the understanding therefore can be

discovered when we can completely exhibit the functions of unity in

judgements and that this may be effected very easily the following section

will show


section ii of the logical function of the

understanding in judgements  5


if we abstract all the content of a judgement and consider only the

intellectual form thereof we find that the function of thought in a judgement

can be brought under four heads of which each contains three momenta these

may be conveniently represented in the following table

as this division appears to differ in some though not essential points from

the usual technique of logicians the following observations for the

prevention of otherwise possible misunderstanding will not be without their

use




1 logicians say with justice that in the use of judgements in syllogisms

singular judgements may be treated like universal ones for precisely because

a singular judgement has no extent at all its predicate cannot refer to a part

of that which is contained in the conception of the subject and be excluded

from the rest the predicate is valid for the whole conception just as if it

were a general conception and had extent to the whole of which the predicate

applied on the other hand let us compare a singular with a general judgement

merely as a cognition in regard to quantity the singular judgement relates to

the general one as unity to infinity and is therefore in itself essentially

different thus if we estimate a singular judgement judicium

singulare not merely according to its intrinsic validity as a judgement

but also as a cognition generally according to its quantity in comparison with

that of other cognitions it is then entirely different from a general

judgement judicium commune and in a complete table of the momenta of

thought deserves a separate placethough indeed this would not be

necessary in a logic limited merely to the consideration of the use of

judgements in reference to each other




2 in like manner in transcendental logic infinite must be distinguished from

affirmative judgements although in general logic they are rightly enough

classed under affirmative general logic abstracts all content of the predicate

though it be negative and only considers whether the said predicate be

affirmed or denied of the subject but transcendental logic considers also the

worth or content of this logical affirmationan affirmation by means of a

merely negative predicate and inquires how much the sum total of our cognition

gains by this affirmation for example if i say of the soul it is not

mortalby this negative judgement i should at least ward off

error now by the proposition the soul is not mortal i have

in respect of the logical form really affirmed inasmuch as i thereby place

the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings now because of the whole

sphere of possible existences the mortal occupies one part and the immortal

the other neither more nor less is affirmed by the proposition than that the

soul is one among the infinite multitude of things which remain over when i

take away the whole mortal part but by this proceeding we accomplish only this

much that the infinite sphere of all possible existences is in so far limited

that the mortal is excluded from it and the soul is placed in the remaining

part of the extent of this sphere but this part remains notwithstanding this

exception infinite and more and more parts may be taken away from the whole

sphere without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting or affirmatively

determining our conception of the soul these judgements therefore infinite

in respect of their logical extent are in respect of the content of their

cognition merely limitative and are consequently entitled to a place in our

transcendental table of all the momenta of thought in judgements because the

function of the understanding exercised by them may perhaps be of importance in

the field of its pure  priori cognition




3 all relations of thought in judgements are those a of the predicate to the

subject b of the principle to its consequence c of the divided cognition

and all the members of the division to each other in the first of these three

classes we consider only two conceptions in the second two judgements in

the third several judgements in relation to each other the hypothetical

proposition if perfect justice exists the obstinately wicked are

punished contains properly the relation to each other of two

propositions namely perfect justice exists and the

obstinately wicked are punished whether these propositions are in

themselves true is a question not here decided nothing is cogitated by means

of this judgement except a certain consequence finally the disjunctive

judgement contains a relation of two or more propositions to each othera

relation not of consequence but of logical opposition in so far as the sphere

of the one proposition excludes that of the other but it contains at the same

time a relation of community in so far as all the propositions taken together

fill up the sphere of the cognition the disjunctive judgement contains

therefore the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a cognition since

the sphere of each part is a complemental part of the sphere of the other each

contributing to form the sum total of the divided cognition take for example

the proposition the world exists either through blind chance or

through internal necessity or through an external cause each of these

propositions embraces a part of the sphere of our possible cognition as to the

existence of a world all of them taken together the whole sphere to take the

cognition out of one of these spheres is equivalent to placing it in one of

the others and on the other hand to place it in one sphere is equivalent to

taking it out of the rest there is therefore in a disjunctive judgement a

certain community of cognitions which consists in this that they mutually

exclude each other yet thereby determine as a whole the true cognition

inasmuch as taken together they make up the complete content of a particular

given cognition and this is all that i find necessary for the sake of what

follows to remark in this place




4 the modality of judgements is a quite peculiar function with this

distinguishing characteristic that it contributes nothing to the content of a

judgement for besides quantity quality and relation there is nothing more

that constitutes the content of a judgement but concerns itself only with the

value of the copula in relation to thought in general problematical judgements

are those in which the affirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible

ad libitum in the assertorical we regard the proposition as real true in

the apodeictical we look on it as necessary13 thus the two

judgements antecedens et consequens the relation of which constitutes a

hypothetical judgement likewise those the members of the division in whose

reciprocity the disjunctive consists are only problematical in the example

above given the proposition there exists perfect justice is not

stated assertorically but as an ad libitum judgement which someone may choose

to adopt and the consequence alone is assertorical hence such judgements may

be obviously false and yet taken problematically be conditions of our

cognition of the truth thus the proposition the world exists only by

blind chance is in the disjunctive judgement of problematical import

only that is to say one may accept it for the moment and it helps us like

the indication of the wrong road among all the roads that one can take to find

out the true proposition the problematical proposition is therefore that

which expresses only logical possibility which is not objective that is it

expresses a free choice to admit the validity of such a propositiona

merely arbitrary reception of it into the understanding the assertorical

speaks of logical reality or truth as for example in a hypothetical

syllogism the antecedens presents itself in a problematical form in the major

in an assertorical form in the minor and it shows that the proposition is in

harmony with the laws of the understanding the apodeictical proposition

cogitates the assertorical as determined by these very laws of the

understanding consequently as affirming  priori and in this manner it

expresses logical necessity now because all is here gradually incorporated

with the understandinginasmuch as in the first place we judge

problematically then accept assertorically our judgement as true lastly

affirm it as inseparably united with the understanding that is as necessary

and apodeicticalwe may safely reckon these three functions of modality

as so many momenta of thought



 13

just as if thought were in the first instance a function of the understanding

in the second of judgement in the third of reason a remark which will be

explained in the sequel


section iii of the pure conceptions of the

understanding or categories  6


general logic as has been repeatedly said makes abstraction of all content of

cognition and expects to receive representations from some other quarter in

order by means of analysis to convert them into conceptions on the contrary

transcendental logic has lying before it the manifold content of  priori

sensibility which transcendental sthetic presents to it in order to give

matter to the pure conceptions of the understanding without which

transcendental logic would have no content and be therefore utterly void now

space and time contain an infinite diversity of determinations of pure  priori

intuition but are nevertheless the condition of the minds receptivity

under which alone it can obtain representations of objects and which

consequently must always affect the conception of these objects but the

spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examined after a certain

manner received into the mind and connected in order afterwards to form a

cognition out of it this process i call synthesis




by the word synthesis in its most general signification i understand the

process of joining different representations to each other and of comprehending

their diversity in one cognition this synthesis is pure when the diversity is

not given empirically but  priori as that in space and time our

representations must be given previously to any analysis of them and no

conceptions can arise quoad their content analytically but the synthesis of

a diversity be it given  priori or empirically is the first requisite for

the production of a cognition which in its beginning indeed may be crude and

confused and therefore in need of analysisstill synthesis is that by

which alone the elements of our cognitions are collected and united into a

certain content consequently it is the first thing on which we must fix our

attention if we wish to investigate the origin of our knowledge




synthesis generally speaking is as we shall afterwards see the mere

operation of the imaginationa blind but indispensable function of the

soul without which we should have no cognition whatever but of the working of

which we are seldom even conscious but to reduce this synthesis to conceptions

is a function of the understanding by means of which we attain to cognition

in the proper meaning of the term




pure synthesis represented generally gives us the pure conception of the

understanding but by this pure synthesis i mean that which rests upon a basis

of  priori synthetical unity thus our numeration and this is more

observable in large numbers is a synthesis according to conceptions because

it takes place according to a common basis of unity for example the decade

by means of this conception therefore the unity in the synthesis of the

manifold becomes necessary




by means of analysis different representations are brought under one

conceptionan operation of which general logic treats on the other hand

the duty of transcendental logic is to reduce to conceptions not

representations but the pure synthesis of representations the first thing

which must be given to us for the sake of the  priori cognition of all

objects is the diversity of the pure intuition the synthesis of this

diversity by means of the imagination is the second but this gives as yet no

cognition the conceptions which give unity to this pure synthesis and which

consist solely in the representation of this necessary synthetical unity

furnish the third requisite for the cognition of an object and these

conceptions are given by the understanding




the same function which gives unity to the different representation in a

judgement gives also unity to the mere synthesis of different representations

in an intuition and this unity we call the pure conception of the

understanding thus the same understanding and by the same operations

whereby in conceptions by means of analytical unity it produced the logical

form of a judgement introduces by means of the synthetical unity of the

manifold in intuition a transcendental content into its representations on

which account they are called pure conceptions of the understanding and they

apply  priori to objects a result not within the power of general logic




in this manner there arise exactly so many pure conceptions of the

understanding applying  priori to objects of intuition in general as there

are logical functions in all possible judgements for there is no other

function or faculty existing in the understanding besides those enumerated in

that table these conceptions we shall with aristotle call categories our

purpose being originally identical with his notwithstanding the great

difference in the execution




                     table of the categories



                    1                         2

              existencenonexistence

              necessitycontingence




this then is a catalogue of all the originally pure conceptions of the

synthesis which the understanding contains  priori and these conceptions

alone entitle it to be called a pure understanding inasmuch as only by them it

can render the manifold of intuition conceivable in other words think an

object of intuition this division is made systematically from a common

principle namely the faculty of judgement which is just the same as the power

of thought and has not arisen rhapsodically from a search at haphazard after

pure conceptions respecting the full number of which we never could be

certain inasmuch as we employ induction alone in our search without

considering that in this way we can never understand wherefore precisely these

conceptions and none others abide in the pure understanding it was a design

worthy of an acute thinker like aristotle to search for these fundamental

conceptions destitute however of any guiding principle he picked them up

just as they occurred to him and at first hunted out ten which he called

categories predicaments afterwards be believed that he had discovered five

others which were added under the name of post predicaments but his catalogue

still remained defective besides there are to be found among them some of the

modes of pure sensibility quando ubi situs also prius simul and likewise

an empirical conception motuswhich can by no means belong to this

genealogical register of the pure understanding moreover there are deduced

conceptions actio passio enumerated among the original conceptions and of

the latter some are entirely wanting




with regard to these it is to be remarked that the categories as the true

primitive conceptions of the pure understanding have also their pure deduced

conceptions which in a complete system of transcendental philosophy must by

no means be passed over though in a merely critical essay we must be contented

with the simple mention of the fact




let it be allowed me to call these pure but deduced conceptions of the

understanding the predicables of the pure understanding in contradistinction

to predicaments if we are in possession of the original and primitive the

deduced and subsidiary conceptions can easily be added and the genealogical

tree of the understanding completely delineated as my present aim is not to

set forth a complete system but merely the principles of one i reserve this

task for another time it may be easily executed by any one who will refer to

the ontological manuals and subordinate to the category of causality for

example the predicables of force action passion to that of community those

of presence and resistance to the categories of modality those of

origination extinction change and so with the rest the categories combined

with the modes of pure sensibility or with one another afford a great number

of deduced  priori conceptions a complete enumeration of which would be a

useful and not unpleasant but in this place a perfectly dispensable

occupation




i purposely omit the definitions of the categories in this treatise i shall

analyse these conceptions only so far as is necessary for the doctrine of

method which is to form a part of this critique in a system of pure reason

definitions of them would be with justice demanded of me but to give them here

would only bide from our view the main aim of our investigation at the same

time raising doubts and objections the consideration of which without

injustice to our main purpose may be very well postponed till another

opportunity meanwhile it ought to be sufficiently clear from the little we

have already said on this subject that the formation of a complete vocabulary

of pure conceptions accompanied by all the requisite explanations is not only

a possible but an easy undertaking the compartments already exist it is only

necessary to fill them up and a systematic topic like the present indicates

with perfect precision the proper place to which each conception belongs while

it readily points out any that have not yet been filled up




 7




our table of the categories suggests considerations of some importance which

may perhaps have significant results in regard to the scientific form of all

rational cognitions for that this table is useful in the theoretical part of

philosophy nay indispensable for the sketching of the complete plan of a

science so far as that science rests upon conceptions  priori and for

dividing it mathematically according to fixed principles is most manifest

from the fact that it contains all the elementary conceptions of the

understanding nay even the form of a system of these in the understanding

itself and consequently indicates all the momenta and also the internal

arrangement of a projected speculative science as i have elsewhere shown14 here follow some of these observations



 14

in the metaphysical principles of natural science




i this table which contains four classes of conceptions of the understanding

may in the first instance be divided into two classes the first of which

relates to objects of intuitionpure as well as empirical the second to

the existence of these objects either in relation to one another or to the

understanding




the former of these classes of categories i would entitle the mathematical and

the latter the dynamical categories the former as we see has no correlates

these are only to be found in the second class this difference must have a

ground in the nature of the human understanding




ii the number of the categories in each class is always the same namely

threea fact which also demands some consideration because in all other

cases division  priori through conceptions is necessarily dichotomy it is to

be added that the third category in each triad always arises from the

combination of the second with the first




thus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity limitation

is merely reality conjoined with negation community is the causality of a

substance reciprocally determining and determined by other substances and

finally necessity is nothing but existence which is given through the

possibility itself let it not be supposed however that the third category is

merely a deduced and not a primitive conception of the pure understanding for

the conjunction of the first and second in order to produce the third

conception requires a particular function of the understanding which is by no

means identical with those which are exercised in the first and second thus

the conception of a number which belongs to the category of totality is not

always possible where the conceptions of multitude and unity exist for

example in the representation of the infinite or if i conjoin the

conception of a cause with that of a substance it does not follow that the

conception of influence that is how one substance can be the cause of

something in another substance will be understood from that thus it is

evident that a particular act of the understanding is here necessary and so in

the other instances




iii with respect to one category namely that of community which is found in

the third class it is not so easy as with the others to detect its accordance

with the form of the disjunctive judgement which corresponds to it in the table

of the logical functions




in order to assure ourselves of this accordance we must observe that in every

disjunctive judgement the sphere of the judgement that is the complex of all

that is contained in it is represented as a whole divided into parts and

since one part cannot be contained in the other they are cogitated as

coordinated with not subordinated to each other so that they do not

determine each other unilaterally as in a linear series but reciprocally as

in an aggregateif one member of the division is posited all the rest

are excluded and conversely




now a like connection is cogitated in a whole of things for one thing is not

subordinated as effect to another as cause of its existence but on the

contrary is coordinated contemporaneously and reciprocally as a cause in

relation to the determination of the others for example in a bodythe

parts of which mutually attract and repel each other and this is an entirely

different kind of connection from that which we find in the mere relation of

the cause to the effect the principle to the consequence for in such a

connection the consequence does not in its turn determine the principle and

therefore does not constitute with the latter a wholejust as the

creator does not with the world make up a whole the process of understanding

by which it represents to itself the sphere of a divided conception is

employed also when we think of a thing as divisible and in the same manner as

the members of the division in the former exclude one another and yet are

connected in one sphere so the understanding represents to itself the parts of

the latter as havingeach of theman existence as substances

independently of the others and yet as united in one whole




 8




in the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there exists one more leading

division which contains pure conceptions of the understanding and which

although not numbered among the categories ought according to them as

conceptions  priori to be valid of objects but in this case they would

augment the number of the categories which cannot be these are set forth in

the proposition so renowned among the schoolmenquodlibet ens

est unum verum bonum now though the inferences from this

principle were mere tautological propositions and though it is allowed only by

courtesy to retain a place in modern metaphysics yet a thought which

maintained itself for such a length of time however empty it seems to be

deserves an investigation of its origin and justifies the conjecture that it

must be grounded in some law of the understanding which as is often the case

has only been erroneously interpreted these pretended transcendental

predicates are in fact nothing but logical requisites and criteria of all

cognition of objects and they employ as the basis for this cognition the

categories of quantity namely unity plurality and totality but these

which must be taken as material conditions that is as belonging to the

possibility of things themselves they employed merely in a formal

signification as belonging to the logical requisites of all cognition and yet

most unguardedly changed these criteria of thought into properties of objects

as things in themselves now in every cognition of an object there is unity

of conception which may be called qualitative unity so far as by this term we

understand only the unity in our connection of the manifold for example unity

of the theme in a play an oration or a story secondly there is truth in

respect of the deductions from it the more true deductions we have from a

given conception the more criteria of its objective reality this we might

call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks which belong to a

conception as to a common foundation but are not cogitated as a quantity in

it thirdly there is perfectionwhich consists in this that the

plurality falls back upon the unity of the conception and accords completely

with that conception and with no other this we may denominate qualitative

completeness hence it is evident that these logical criteria of the

possibility of cognition are merely the three categories of quantity modified

and transformed to suit an unauthorized manner of applying them that is to

say the three categories in which the unity in the production of the quantum

must be homogeneous throughout are transformed solely with a view to the

connection of heterogeneous parts of cognition in one act of consciousness by

means of the quality of the cognition which is the principle of that

connection thus the criterion of the possibility of a conception not of its

object is the definition of it in which the unity of the conception the

truth of all that may be immediately deduced from it and finally the

completeness of what has been thus deduced constitute the requisites for the

reproduction of the whole conception thus also the criterion or test of an

hypothesis is the intelligibility of the received principle of explanation or

its unity without help from any subsidiary hypothesisthe truth of our

deductions from it consistency with each other and with experienceand

lastly the completeness of the principle of the explanation of these

deductions which refer to neither more nor less than what was admitted in the

hypothesis restoring analytically and  posteriori what was cogitated

synthetically and  priori by the conceptions therefore of unity truth and

perfection we have made no addition to the transcendental table of the

categories which is complete without them we have on the contrary merely

employed the three categories of quantity setting aside their application to

objects of experience as general logical laws of the consistency of cognition

with itself


chapter ii of the deduction of the pure conceptions

of the understanding
section i of the principles of a transcendental

deduction in general  9


teachers of jurisprudence when speaking of rights and claims distinguish in a

cause the question of right quid juris from the question of fact quid

facti and while they demand proof of both they give to the proof of the

former which goes to establish right or claim in law the name of deduction

now we make use of a great number of empirical conceptions without opposition

from any one and consider ourselves even without any attempt at deduction

justified in attaching to them a sense and a supposititious signification

because we have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objective

reality there exist also however usurped conceptions such as fortune fate

which circulate with almost universal indulgence and yet are occasionally

challenged by the question quid juris in such cases we have

great difficulty in discovering any deduction for these terms inasmuch as we

cannot produce any manifest ground of right either from experience or from

reason on which the claim to employ them can be founded




among the many conceptions which make up the very variegated web of human

cognition some are destined for pure use  priori independent of all

experience and their title to be so employed always requires a deduction

inasmuch as to justify such use of them proofs from experience are not

sufficient but it is necessary to know how these conceptions can apply to

objects without being derived from experience i term therefore an

examination of the manner in which conceptions can apply  priori to objects

the transcendental deduction of conceptions and i distinguish it from the

empirical deduction which indicates the mode in which conception is obtained

through experience and reflection thereon consequently does not concern

itself with the right but only with the fact of our obtaining conceptions in

such and such a manner we have already seen that we are in possession of two

perfectly different kinds of conceptions which nevertheless agree with each

other in this that they both apply to objects completely  priori these are

the conceptions of space and time as forms of sensibility and the categories

as pure conceptions of the understanding to attempt an empirical deduction of

either of these classes would be labour in vain because the distinguishing

characteristic of their nature consists in this that they apply to their

objects without having borrowed anything from experience towards the

representation of them consequently if a deduction of these conceptions is

necessary it must always be transcendental




meanwhile with respect to these conceptions as with respect to all our

cognition we certainly may discover in experience if not the principle of

their possibility yet the occasioning causes of their production it will be

found that the impressions of sense give the first occasion for bringing into

action the whole faculty of cognition and for the production of experience

which contains two very dissimilar elements namely a matter for cognition

given by the senses and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter

arising out of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought and these on

occasion given by sensuous impressions are called into exercise and produce

conceptions such an investigation into the first efforts of our faculty of

cognition to mount from particular perceptions to general conceptions is

undoubtedly of great utility and we have to thank the celebrated locke for

having first opened the way for this inquiry but a deduction of the pure 

priori conceptions of course never can be made in this way seeing that in

regard to their future employment which must be entirely independent of

experience they must have a far different certificate of birth to show from

that of a descent from experience this attempted physiological derivation

which cannot properly be called deduction because it relates merely to a

quaestio facti i shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a pure

cognition it is therefore manifest that there can only be a transcendental

deduction of these conceptions and by no means an empirical one also that all

attempts at an empirical deduction in regard to pure  priori conceptions are

vain and can only be made by one who does not understand the altogether

peculiar nature of these cognitions




but although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure  priori

cognition is a transcendental deduction it is not for that reason perfectly

manifest that such a deduction is absolutely necessary we have already traced

to their sources the conceptions of space and time by means of a

transcendental deduction and we have explained and determined their objective

validity  priori geometry nevertheless advances steadily and securely in

the province of pure  priori cognitions without needing to ask from

philosophy any certificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its

fundamental conception of space but the use of the conception in this science

extends only to the external world of sense the pure form of the intuition of

which is space and in this world therefore all geometrical cognition

because it is founded upon  priori intuition possesses immediate evidence

and the objects of this cognition are given  priori as regards their form in

intuition by and through the cognition itself with the pure conceptions of

understanding on the contrary commences the absolute necessity of seeking a

transcendental deduction not only of these conceptions themselves but

likewise of space because inasmuch as they make affirmations concerning

objects not by means of the predicates of intuition and sensibility but of

pure thought  priori they apply to objects without any of the conditions of

sensibility besides not being founded on experience they are not presented

with any object in  priori intuition upon which antecedently to experience

they might base their synthesis hence results not only doubt as to the

objective validity and proper limits of their use but that even our conception

of space is rendered equivocal inasmuch as we are very ready with the aid of

the categories to carry the use of this conception beyond the conditions of

sensuous intuitionand for this reason we have already found a

transcendental deduction of it needful the reader then must be quite

convinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction before

taking a single step in the field of pure reason because otherwise he goes to

work blindly and after he has wondered about in all directions returns to the

state of utter ignorance from which he started he ought moreover clearly to

recognize beforehand the unavoidable difficulties in his undertaking so that

he may not afterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself is

deeply involved or become too soon impatient of the obstacles in his path

because we have a choice of only two thingseither at once to give up all

pretensions to knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience or to bring

this critical investigation to completion




we have been able with very little trouble to make it comprehensible how the

conceptions of space and time although  priori cognitions must necessarily

apply to external objects and render a synthetical cognition of these

possible independently of all experience for inasmuch as only by means of

such pure form of sensibility an object can appear to us that is be an object

of empirical intuition space and time are pure intuitions which contain 

priori the condition of the possibility of objects as phenomena and an 

priori synthesis in these intuitions possesses objective validity




on the other hand the categories of the understanding do not represent the

conditions under which objects are given to us in intuition objects can

consequently appear to us without necessarily connecting themselves with these

and consequently without any necessity binding on the understanding to contain

 priori the conditions of these objects thus we find ourselves involved in a

difficulty which did not present itself in the sphere of sensibility that is

to say we cannot discover how the subjective conditions of thought can have

objective validity in other words can become conditions of the possibility of

all cognition of objects for phenomena may certainly be given to us in

intuition without any help from the functions of the understanding let us

take for example the conception of cause which indicates a peculiar kind of

synthesis namely that with something a something entirely different b is

connected according to a law it is not  priori manifest why phenomena should

contain anything of this kind we are of course debarred from appealing for

proof to experience for the objective validity of this conception must be

demonstrated  priori and it hence remains doubtful  priori whether such a

conception be not quite void and without any corresponding object among

phenomena for that objects of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formal

conditions of sensibility existing  priori in the mind is quite evident from

the fact that without these they could not be objects for us but that they

must also correspond to the conditions which understanding requires for the

synthetical unity of thought is an assertion the grounds for which are not so

easily to be discovered for phenomena might be so constituted as not to

correspond to the conditions of the unity of thought and all things might lie

in such confusion that for example nothing could be met with in the sphere of

phenomena to suggest a law of synthesis and so correspond to the conception of

cause and effect so that this conception would be quite void null and

without significance phenomena would nevertheless continue to present objects

to our intuition for mere intuition does not in any respect stand in need of

the functions of thought




if we thought to free ourselves from the labour of these investigations by

saying experience is constantly offering us examples of the relation of

cause and effect in phenomena and presents us with abundant opportunity of

abstracting the conception of cause and so at the same time of corroborating

the objective validity of this conception we should in this case be

overlooking the fact that the conception of cause cannot arise in this way at

all that on the contrary it must either have an  priori basis in the

understanding or be rejected as a mere chimera for this conception demands

that something a should be of such a nature that something else b should

follow from it necessarily and according to an absolutely universal law we

may certainly collect from phenomena a law according to which this or that

usually happens but the element of necessity is not to be found in it hence

it is evident that to the synthesis of cause and effect belongs a dignity

which is utterly wanting in any empirical synthesis for it is no mere

mechanical synthesis by means of addition but a dynamical one that is to

say the effect is not to be cogitated as merely annexed to the cause but as

posited by and through the cause and resulting from it the strict

universality of this law never can be a characteristic of empirical laws which

obtain through induction only a comparative universality that is an extended

range of practical application but the pure conceptions of the understanding

would entirely lose all their peculiar character if we treated them merely as

the productions of experience


transition to the transcendental deduction of the

categories  10


there are only two possible ways in which synthetical representation and its

objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other and as it

were meet together either the object alone makes the representation possible

or the representation alone makes the object possible in the former case the

relation between them is only empirical and an  priori representation is

impossible and this is the case with phenomena as regards that in them which

is referable to mere sensation in the latter casealthough

representation alone for of its causality by means of the will we do not

here speak does not produce the object as to its existence it must

nevertheless be  priori determinative in regard to the object if it is only

by means of the representation that we can cognize anything as an object now

there are only two conditions of the possibility of a cognition of objects

firstly intuition by means of which the object though only as phenomenon is

given secondly conception by means of which the object which corresponds to

this intuition is thought but it is evident from what has been said on

sthetic that the first condition under which alone objects can be intuited

must in fact exist as a formal basis for them  priori in the mind with this

formal condition of sensibility therefore all phenomena necessarily

correspond because it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all

that is can be empirically intuited and given now the question is whether

there do not exist  priori in the mind conceptions of understanding also as

conditions under which alone something if not intuited is yet thought as

object if this question be answered in the affirmative it follows that all

empirical cognition of objects is necessarily conformable to such conceptions

since if they are not presupposed it is impossible that anything can be an

object of experience now all experience contains besides the intuition of the

senses through which an object is given a conception also of an object that is

given in intuition accordingly conceptions of objects in general must lie as

 priori conditions at the foundation of all empirical cognition and

consequently the objective validity of the categories as  priori

conceptions will rest upon this that experience as far as regards the form

of thought is possible only by their means for in that case they apply

necessarily and  priori to objects of experience because only through them

can an object of experience be thought




the whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all  priori conceptions is to

show that these conceptions are  priori conditions of the possibility of all

experience conceptions which afford us the objective foundation of the

possibility of experience are for that very reason necessary but the analysis

of the experiences in which they are met with is not deduction but only an

illustration of them because from experience they could never derive the

attribute of necessity without their original applicability and relation to

all possible experience in which all objects of cognition present themselves

the relation of the categories to objects of whatever nature would be quite

incomprehensible




the celebrated locke for want of due reflection on these points and because

he met with pure conceptions of the understanding in experience sought also to

deduce them from experience and yet proceeded so inconsequently as to attempt

with their aid to arrive it cognitions which lie far beyond the limits of all

experience david hume perceived that to render this possible it was

necessary that the conceptions should have an  priori origin but as he could

not explain how it was possible that conceptions which are not connected with

each other in the understanding must nevertheless be thought as necessarily

connected in the objectand it never occurred to him that the

understanding itself might perhaps by means of these conceptions be the

author of the experience in which its objects were presented to ithe was

forced to drive these conceptions from experience that is from a subjective

necessity arising from repeated association of experiences erroneously

considered to be objectivein one word from habit but he proceeded with

perfect consequence and declared it to be impossible with such conceptions and

the principles arising from them to overstep the limits of experience the

empirical derivation however which both of these philosophers attributed to

these conceptions cannot possibly be reconciled with the fact that we do

possess scientific  priori cognitions namely those of pure mathematics and

general physics




the former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door to

extravagancefor if reason has once undoubted right on its side it will

not allow itself to be confined to set limits by vague recommendations of

moderation the latter gave himself up entirely to scepticisma natural

consequence after having discovered as he thought that the faculty of

cognition was not trustworthy we now intend to make a trial whether it be not

possible safely to conduct reason between these two rocks to assign her

determinate limits and yet leave open for her the entire sphere of her

legitimate activity




i shall merely premise an explanation of what the categories are they are

conceptions of an object in general by means of which its intuition is

contemplated as determined in relation to one of the logical functions of

judgement the following will make this plain the function of the categorical

judgement is that of the relation of subject to predicate for example in the

proposition all bodies are divisible but in regard to the

merely logical use of the understanding it still remains undetermined to which

of these two conceptions belongs the function of subject and to which that of

predicate for we could also say some divisible is a body but

the category of substance when the conception of a body is brought under it

determines that and its empirical intuition in experience must be contemplated

always as subject and never as mere predicate and so with all the other

categories


section ii transcendental deduction of the pure

conceptions of the understanding
of the possibility of a conjunction of the manifold

representations given by sense  11


the manifold content in our representations can be given in an intuition which

is merely sensuousin other words is nothing but susceptibility and the

form of this intuition can exist  priori in our faculty of representation

without being anything else but the mode in which the subject is affected but

the conjunction conjunctio of a manifold in intuition never can be given us

by the senses it cannot therefore be contained in the pure form of sensuous

intuition for it is a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation and as

we must to distinguish it from sensibility entitle this faculty

understanding so all conjunction whether conscious or unconscious be it of

the manifold in intuition sensuous or nonsensuous or of several

conceptionsis an act of the understanding to this act we shall give the

general appellation of synthesis thereby to indicate at the same time that

we cannot represent anything as conjoined in the object without having

previously conjoined it ourselves of all mental notions that of conjunction

is the only one which cannot be given through objects but can be originated

only by the subject itself because it is an act of its purely spontaneous

activity the reader will easily enough perceive that the possibility of

conjunction must be grounded in the very nature of this act and that it must

be equally valid for all conjunction and that analysis which appears to be

its contrary must nevertheless always presuppose it for where the

understanding has not previously conjoined it cannot dissect or analyse

because only as conjoined by it must that which is to be analysed have been

given to our faculty of representation




but the conception of conjunction includes besides the conception of the

manifold and of the synthesis of it that of the unity of it also conjunction

is the representation of the synthetical unity of the manifold15 this idea of unity therefore cannot

arise out of that of conjunction much rather does that idea by combining

itself with the representation of the manifold render the conception of

conjunction possible this unity which  priori precedes all conceptions of

conjunction is not the category of unity  6 for all the categories are

based upon logical functions of judgement and in these functions we already

have conjunction and consequently unity of given conceptions it is therefore

evident that the category of unity presupposes conjunction we must therefore

look still higher for this unity as qualitative  8 in that namely which

contains the ground of the unity of diverse conceptions in judgements the

ground consequently of the possibility of the existence of the understanding

even in regard to its logical use



 15

whether the representations are in themselves identical and consequently

whether one can be thought analytically by means of and through the other is a

question which we need not at present consider our consciousness of the one

when we speak of the manifold is always distinguishable from our consciousness

of the other and it is only respecting the synthesis of this possible

consciousness that we here treat


of the originally synthetical unity of apperception 

12


the i think must accompany all my representations for otherwise

something would be represented in me which could not be thought in other

words the representation would either be impossible or at least be in

relation to me nothing that representation which can be given previously to

all thought is called intuition all the diversity or manifold content of

intuition has therefore a necessary relation to the i think

in the subject in which this diversity is found but this representation

i think is an act of spontaneity that is to say it cannot be

regarded as belonging to mere sensibility i call it pure apperception in

order to distinguish it from empirical or primitive apperception because it

is selfconsciousness which whilst it gives birth to the representation

i think must necessarily be capable of accompanying all our

representations it is in all acts of consciousness one and the same and

unaccompanied by it no representation can exist for me the unity of this

apperception i call the transcendental unity of selfconsciousness in order to

indicate the possibility of  priori cognition arising from it for the

manifold representations which are given in an intuition would not all of them

be my representations if they did not all belong to one selfconsciousness

that is as my representations even although i am not conscious of them as

such they must conform to the condition under which alone they can exist

together in a common selfconsciousness because otherwise they would not all

without exception belong to me from this primitive conjunction follow many

important results




for example this universal identity of the apperception of the manifold given

in intuition contains a synthesis of representations and is possible only by

means of the consciousness of this synthesis for the empirical consciousness

which accompanies different representations is in itself fragmentary and

disunited and without relation to the identity of the subject this relation

then does not exist because i accompany every representation with

consciousness but because i join one representation to another and am

conscious of the synthesis of them consequently only because i can connect a

variety of given representations in one consciousness is it possible that i

can represent to myself the identity of consciousness in these representations

in other words the analytical unity of apperception is possible only under the

presupposition of a synthetical unity16 the thought

these representations given in intuition belong all of them to

me is accordingly just the same as i unite them in one

selfconsciousness or can at least so unite them and although this

thought is not itself the consciousness of the synthesis of representations it

presupposes the possibility of it that is to say for the reason alone that i

can comprehend the variety of my representations in one consciousness do i

call them my representations for otherwise i must have as manycoloured and

various a self as are the representations of which i am conscious synthetical

unity of the manifold in intuitions as given  priori is therefore the

foundation of the identity of apperception itself which antecedes  priori all

determinate thought but the conjunction of representations into a conception

is not to be found in objects themselves nor can it be as it were borrowed

from them and taken up into the understanding by perception but it is on the

contrary an operation of the understanding itself which is nothing more than

the faculty of conjoining  priori and of bringing the variety of given

representations under the unity of apperception this principle is the highest

in all human cognition



 16

all general conceptionsas suchdepend for their existence on the

analytical unity of consciousness for example when i think of red in general

i thereby think to myself a property which as a characteristic mark can be

discovered somewhere or can be united with other representations

consequently it is only by means of a forethought possible synthetical unity

that i can think to myself the analytical a representation which is cogitated

as common to different representations is regarded as belonging to such as

besides this common representation contain something different consequently

it must be previously thought in synthetical unity with other although only

possible representations before i can think in it the analytical unity of

consciousness which makes it a conceptas communis and thus the synthetical

unity of apperception is the highest point with which we must connect every

operation of the understanding even the whole of logic and after it our

transcendental philosophy indeed this faculty is the understanding itself




this fundamental principle of the necessary unity of apperception is indeed an

identical and therefore analytical proposition but it nevertheless explains

the necessity for a synthesis of the manifold given in an intuition without

which the identity of selfconsciousness would be incogitable for the ego as

a simple representation presents us with no manifold content only in

intuition which is quite different from the representation ego can it be

given us and by means of conjunction it is cogitated in one

selfconsciousness an understanding in which all the manifold should be given

by means of consciousness itself would be intuitive our understanding can

only think and must look for its intuition to sense i am therefore conscious

of my identical self in relation to all the variety of representations given

to me in an intuition because i call all of them my representations in other

words i am conscious myself of a necessary  priori synthesis of my

representations which is called the original synthetical unity of

apperception under which rank all the representations presented to me but

that only by means of a synthesis


the principle of the synthetical unity of apperception

is the highest principle of all exercise of the understanding  13


the supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation to

sensibility was according to our transcendental sthetic that all the

manifold in intuition be subject to the formal conditions of space and time

the supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation to the understanding

is that all the manifold in it be subject to conditions of the originally

synthetical unity or apperception17 to the former of these two principles

are subject all the various representations of intuition in so far as they are

given to us to the latter in so far as they must be capable of conjunction in

one consciousness for without this nothing can be thought or cognized because

the given representations would not have in common the act of the apperception

i think and therefore could not be connected in one

selfconsciousness



 17

space and time and all portions thereof are intuitions consequently are

with a manifold for their content single representations see the

transcendental sthetic consequently they are not pure conceptions by means

of which the same consciousness is found in a great number of representations

but on the contrary they are many representations contained in one the

consciousness of which is so to speak compounded the unity of consciousness

is nevertheless synthetical and therefore primitive from this peculiar

character of consciousness follow many important consequences see  21




understanding is to speak generally the faculty of cognitions these consist

in the determined relation of given representation to an object but an object

is that in the conception of which the manifold in a given intuition is

united now all union of representations requires unity of consciousness in the

synthesis of them consequently it is the unity of consciousness alone that

constitutes the possibility of representations relating to an object and

therefore of their objective validity and of their becoming cognitions and

consequently the possibility of the existence of the understanding itself




the first pure cognition of understanding then upon which is founded all its

other exercise and which is at the same time perfectly independent of all

conditions of mere sensuous intuition is the principle of the original

synthetical unity of apperception thus the mere form of external sensuous

intuition namely space affords us per se no cognition it merely

contributes the manifold in  priori intuition to a possible cognition but in

order to cognize something in space for example a line i must draw it and

thus produce synthetically a determined conjunction of the given manifold so

that the unity of this act is at the same time the unity of consciousness in

the conception of a line and by this means alone is an object a determinate

space cognized the synthetical unity of consciousness is therefore an

objective condition of all cognition which i do not merely require in order to

cognize an object but to which every intuition must necessarily be subject in

order to become an object for me because in any other way and without this

synthesis the manifold in intuition could not be united in one consciousness




this proposition is as already said itself analytical although it

constitutes the synthetical unity the condition of all thought for it states

nothing more than that all my representations in any given intuition must be

subject to the condition which alone enables me to connect them as my

representation with the identical self and so to unite them synthetically in

one apperception by means of the general expression i think




but this principle is not to be regarded as a principle for every possible

understanding but only for the understanding by means of whose pure

apperception in the thought i am no manifold content is given the

understanding or mind which contained the manifold in intuition in and through

the act itself of its own selfconsciousness in other words an understanding

by and in the representation of which the objects of the representation should

at the same time exist would not require a special act of synthesis of the

manifold as the condition of the unity of its consciousness an act of which

the human understanding which thinks only and cannot intuite has absolute

need but this principle is the first principle of all the operations of our

understanding so that we cannot form the least conception of any other

possible understanding either of one such as should be itself intuition or

possess a sensuous intuition but with forms different from those of space and

time


what objective unity of selfconsciousness is 

14


it is by means of the transcendental unity of apperception that all the

manifold given in an intuition is united into a conception of the object on

this account it is called objective and must be distinguished from the

subjective unity of consciousness which is a determination of the internal

sense by means of which the said manifold in intuition is given empirically to

be so united whether i can be empirically conscious of the manifold as

coexistent or as successive depends upon circumstances or empirical

conditions hence the empirical unity of consciousness by means of association

of representations itself relates to a phenomenal world and is wholly

contingent on the contrary the pure form of intuition in time merely as an

intuition which contains a given manifold is subject to the original unity of

consciousness and that solely by means of the necessary relation of the

manifold in intuition to the i think consequently by means of

the pure synthesis of the understanding which lies  priori at the foundation

of all empirical synthesis the transcendental unity of apperception is alone

objectively valid the empirical which we do not consider in this essay and

which is merely a unity deduced from the former under given conditions in

concreto possesses only subjective validity one person connects the notion

conveyed in a word with one thing another with another thing and the unity of

consciousness in that which is empirical is in relation to that which is

given by experience not necessarily and universally valid


the logical form of all judgements consists in the

objective unity of apperception of the conceptions contained therein  15


i could never satisfy myself with the definition which logicians give of a

judgement it is according to them the representation of a relation between

two conceptions i shall not dwell here on the faultiness of this definition

in that it suits only for categorical and not for hypothetical or disjunctive

judgements these latter containing a relation not of conceptions but of

judgements themselvesa blunder from which many evil results have

followed18 it is more important for our present

purpose to observe that this definition does not determine in what the said

relation consists



 18

the tedious doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns only categorical

syllogisms and although it is nothing more than an artifice by surreptitiously

introducing immediate conclusions consequentiae immediatae among the premises

of a pure syllogism to give ism give rise to an appearance of more modes of

drawing a conclusion than that in the first figure the artifice would not have

had much success had not its authors succeeded in bringing categorical

judgements into exclusive respect as those to which all others must be

referreda doctrine however which according to  5 is utterly false




but if i investigate more closely the relation of given cognitions in every

judgement and distinguish it as belonging to the understanding from the

relation which is produced according to laws of the reproductive imagination

which has only subjective validity i find that judgement is nothing but the

mode of bringing given cognitions under the objective unit of apperception

this is plain from our use of the term of relation is in judgements in order

to distinguish the objective unity of given representations from the subjective

unity for this term indicates the relation of these representations to the

original apperception and also their necessary unity even although the

judgement is empirical therefore contingent as in the judgement all

bodies are heavy i do not mean by this that these representations do

necessarily belong to each other in empirical intuition but that by means of

the necessary unity of appreciation they belong to each other in the synthesis

of intuitions that is to say they belong to each other according to

principles of the objective determination of all our representations in so far

as cognition can arise from them these principles being all deduced from the

main principle of the transcendental unity of apperception in this way alone

can there arise from this relation a judgement that is a relation which has

objective validity and is perfectly distinct from that relation of the very

same representations which has only subjective validitya relation to

wit which is produced according to laws of association according to these

laws i could only say when i hold in my hand or carry a body i feel

an impression of weight but i could not say it the body is

heavy for this is tantamount to saying both these representations are

conjoined in the object that is without distinction as to the condition of

the subject and do not merely stand together in my perception however

frequently the perceptive act may be repeated


all sensuous intuitions are subject to the categories

as conditions under which alone the manifold content of them can be united in

one consciousness  16


the manifold content given in a sensuous intuition comes necessarily under the

original synthetical unity of apperception because thereby alone is the unity

of intuition possible  13 but that act of the understanding by which the

manifold content of given representations whether intuitions or conceptions

is brought under one apperception is the logical function of judgements 

15 all the manifold therefore in so far as it is given in one empirical

intuition is determined in relation to one of the logical functions of

judgement by means of which it is brought into union in one consciousness now

the categories are nothing else than these functions of judgement so far as the

manifold in a given intuition is determined in relation to them  9

consequently the manifold in a given intuition is necessarily subject to the

categories of the understanding


observation  17


the manifold in an intuition which i call mine is represented by means of the

synthesis of the understanding as belonging to the necessary unity of

selfconsciousness and this takes place by means of the category19 the category indicates accordingly that

the empirical consciousness of a given manifold in an intuition is subject to a

pure selfconsciousness  priori in the same manner as an empirical intuition

is subject to a pure sensuous intuition which is also  priori in the above

proposition then lies the beginning of a deduction of the pure conceptions of

the understanding now as the categories have their origin in the

understanding alone independently of sensibility i must in my deduction make

abstraction of the mode in which the manifold of an empirical intuition is

given in order to fix my attention exclusively on the unity which is brought

by the understanding into the intuition by means of the category in what

follows  22 it will be shown from the mode in which the empirical

intuition is given in the faculty of sensibility that the unity which belongs

to it is no other than that which the category according to  16 imposes on

the manifold in a given intuition and thus its  priori validity in regard to

all objects of sense being established the purpose of our deduction will be

fully attained



 19

the proof of this rests on the represented unity of intuition by means of

which an object is given and which always includes in itself a synthesis of

the manifold to be intuited and also the relation of this latter to unity of

apperception




but there is one thing in the above demonstration of which i could not make

abstraction namely that the manifold to be intuited must be given previously

to the synthesis of the understanding and independently of it how this takes

place remains here undetermined for if i cogitate an understanding which was

itself intuitive as for example a divine understanding which should not

represent given objects but by whose representation the objects themselves

should be given or produced the categories would possess no significance in

relation to such a faculty of cognition they are merely rules for an

understanding whose whole power consists in thought that is in the act of

submitting the synthesis of the manifold which is presented to it in intuition

from a very different quarter to the unity of apperception a faculty

therefore which cognizes nothing per se but only connects and arranges the

material of cognition the intuition namely which must be presented to it by

means of the object but to show reasons for this peculiar character of our

understandings that it produces unity of apperception  priori only by means

of categories and a certain kind and number thereof is as impossible as to

explain why we are endowed with precisely so many functions of judgement and no

more or why time and space are the only forms of our intuition


in cognition its application to objects of experience

is the only legitimate use of the category  18


to think an object and to cognize an object are by no means the same thing in

cognition there are two elements firstly the conception whereby an object is

cogitated the category and secondly the intuition whereby the object is

given for supposing that to the conception a corresponding intuition could not

be given it would still be a thought as regards its form but without any

object and no cognition of anything would be possible by means of it inasmuch

as so far as i knew there existed and could exist nothing to which my thought

could be applied now all intuition possible to us is sensuous consequently

our thought of an object by means of a pure conception of the understanding

can become cognition for us only in so far as this conception is applied to

objects of the senses sensuous intuition is either pure intuition space and

time or empirical intuitionof that which is immediately represented in

space and time by means of sensation as real through the determination of pure

intuition we obtain  priori cognitions of objects as in mathematics but only

as regards their form as phenomena whether there can exist things which must

be intuited in this form is not thereby established all mathematical

conceptions therefore are not per se cognition except in so far as we

presuppose that there exist things which can only be represented conformably to

the form of our pure sensuous intuition but things in space and time are given

only in so far as they are perceptions representations accompanied with

sensation therefore only by empirical representation consequently the pure

conceptions of the understanding even when they are applied to intuitions 

priori as in mathematics produce cognition only in so far as these and

therefore the conceptions of the understanding by means of them can be applied

to empirical intuitions consequently the categories do not even by means of

pure intuition afford us any cognition of things they can only do so in so far

as they can be applied to empirical intuition that is to say the categories

serve only to render empirical cognition possible but this is what we call

experience consequently in cognition their application to objects of

experience is the only legitimate use of the categories




 19




the foregoing proposition is of the utmost importance for it determines the

limits of the exercise of the pure conceptions of the understanding in regard

to objects just as transcendental sthetic determined the limits of the

exercise of the pure form of our sensuous intuition space and time as

conditions of the possibility of the presentation of objects to us are valid

no further than for objects of sense consequently only for experience beyond

these limits they represent to us nothing for they belong only to sense and

have no reality apart from it the pure conceptions of the understanding are

free from this limitation and extend to objects of intuition in general be

the intuition like or unlike to ours provided only it be sensuous and not

intellectual but this extension of conceptions beyond the range of our

intuition is of no advantage for they are then mere empty conceptions of

objects as to the possibility or impossibility of the existence of which they

furnish us with no means of discovery they are mere forms of thought without

objective reality because we have no intuition to which the synthetical unity

of apperception which alone the categories contain could be applied for the

purpose of determining an object our sensuous and empirical intuition can

alone give them significance and meaning




if then we suppose an object of a nonsensuous intuition to be given we can

in that case represent it by all those predicates which are implied in the

presupposition that nothing appertaining to sensuous intuition belongs to it

for example that it is not extended or in space that its duration is not

time that in it no change the effect of the determinations in time is to be

met with and so on but it is no proper knowledge if i merely indicate what

the intuition of the object is not without being able to say what is contained

in it for i have not shown the possibility of an object to which my pure

conception of understanding could be applicable because i have not been able

to furnish any intuition corresponding to it but am only able to say that our

intuition is not valid for it but the most important point is this that to a

something of this kind not one category can be found applicable take for

example the conception of substance that is something that can exist as

subject but never as mere predicate in regard to this conception i am quite

ignorant whether there can really be anything to correspond to such a

determination of thought if empirical intuition did not afford me the occasion

for its application but of this more in the sequel


of the application of the categories to objects of the

senses in general  20


the pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuition in

general through the understanding alone whether the intuition be our own or

some other provided only it be sensuous but are for this very reason mere

forms of thought by means of which alone no determined object can be cognized

the synthesis or conjunction of the manifold in these conceptions relates we

have said only to the unity of apperception and is for this reason the ground

of the possibility of  priori cognition in so far as this cognition is

dependent on the understanding this synthesis is therefore not merely

transcendental but also purely intellectual but because a certain form of

sensuous intuition exists in the mind  priori which rests on the receptivity

of the representative faculty sensibility the understanding as a

spontaneity is able to determine the internal sense by means of the diversity

of given representations conformably to the synthetical unity of apperception

and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of the apperception of the manifold

of sensuous intuition  priori as the condition to which must necessarily be

submitted all objects of human intuition and in this manner the categories as

mere forms of thought receive objective reality that is application to

objects which are given to us in intuition but that only as phenomena for it

is only of phenomena that we are capable of  priori intuition




this synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition which is possible and

necessary  priori may be called figurative synthesis speciosa in

contradistinction to that which is cogitated in the mere category in regard to

the manifold of an intuition in general and is called connection or

conjunction of the understanding synthesis intellectualis both are

transcendental not merely because they themselves precede  priori all

experience but also because they form the basis for the possibility of other

cognition  priori




but the figurative synthesis when it has relation only to the originally

synthetical unity of apperception that is to the transcendental unity

cogitated in the categories must to be distinguished from the purely

intellectual conjunction be entitled the transcendental synthesis of

imagination imagination is the faculty of representing an object even without

its presence in intuition now as all our intuition is sensuous imagination

by reason of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a

corresponding intuition to the conceptions of the understanding belongs to

sensibility but in so far as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of

spontaneity which is determinative and not like sense merely determinable

and which is consequently able to determine sense  priori according to its

form conformably to the unity of apperception in so far is the imagination a

faculty of determining sensibility  priori and its synthesis of intuitions

according to the categories must be the transcendental synthesis of the

imagination it is an operation of the understanding on sensibility and the

first application of the understanding to objects of possible intuition and at

the same time the basis for the exercise of the other functions of that

faculty as figurative it is distinguished from the merely intellectual

synthesis which is produced by the understanding alone without the aid of

imagination now in so far as imagination is spontaneity i sometimes call it

also the productive imagination and distinguish it from the reproductive the

synthesis of which is subject entirely to empirical laws those of association

namely and which therefore contributes nothing to the explanation of the

possibility of  priori cognition and for this reason belongs not to

transcendental philosophy but to psychology




we have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradox which must

have struck every one in our exposition of the internal sense  6

namelyhow this sense represents us to our own consciousness only as we

appear to ourselves not as we are in ourselves because to wit we intuite

ourselves only as we are inwardly affected now this appears to be

contradictory inasmuch as we thus stand in a passive relation to ourselves

and therefore in the systems of psychology the internal sense is commonly held

to be one with the faculty of apperception while we on the contrary

carefully distinguish them




that which determines the internal sense is the understanding and its original

power of conjoining the manifold of intuition that is of bringing this under

an apperception upon which rests the possibility of the understanding itself

now as the human understanding is not in itself a faculty of intuition and is

unable to exercise such a power in order to conjoin as it were the manifold

of its own intuition the synthesis of understanding is considered per se

nothing but the unity of action of which as such it is selfconscious even

apart from sensibility by which moreover it is able to determine our

internal sense in respect of the manifold which may be presented to it

according to the form of sensuous intuition thus under the name of a

transcendental synthesis of imagination the understanding exercises an

activity upon the passive subject whose faculty it is and so we are right in

saying that the internal sense is affected thereby apperception and its

synthetical unity are by no means one and the same with the internal sense the

former as the source of all our synthetical conjunction applies under the

name of the categories to the manifold of intuition in general prior to all

sensuous intuition of objects the internal sense on the contrary contains

merely the form of intuition but without any synthetical conjunction of the

manifold therein and consequently does not contain any determined intuition

which is possible only through consciousness of the determination of the

manifold by the transcendental act of the imagination synthetical influence of

the understanding on the internal sense which i have named figurative

synthesis




this we can indeed always perceive in ourselves we cannot cogitate a

geometrical line without drawing it in thought nor a circle without describing

it nor represent the three dimensions of space without drawing three lines

from the same point perpendicular to one another we cannot even cogitate time

unless in drawing a straight line which is to serve as the external

figurative representation of time we fix our attention on the act of the

synthesis of the manifold whereby we determine successively the internal

sense and thus attend also to the succession of this determination motion as

an act of the subject not as a determination of an object20 consequently the synthesis of the

manifold in space if we make abstraction of space and attend merely to the act

by which we determine the internal sense according to its form is that which

produces the conception of succession the understanding therefore does by no

means find in the internal sense any such synthesis of the manifold but

produces it in that it affects this sense at the same time how i who

think is distinct from the i which intuites itself other

modes of intuition being cogitable as at least possible and yet one and the

same with this latter as the same subject how therefore i am able to say

i as an intelligence and thinking subject cognize myself as an object

thought so far as i am moreover given to myself in intuitiononly

like other phenomena not as i am in myself and as considered by the

understanding but merely as i appearis a question that has in it

neither more nor less difficulty than the questionhow can i be an

object to myself or thishow i can be an object of my own

intuition and internal perceptions but that such must be the fact if

we admit that space is merely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense

can be clearly proved by the consideration that we cannot represent time which

is not an object of external intuition in any other way than under the image

of a line which we draw in thought a mode of representation without which we

could not cognize the unity of its dimension and also that we are necessitated

to take our determination of periods of time or of points of time for all our

internal perceptions from the changes which we perceive in outward things it

follows that we must arrange the determinations of the internal sense as

phenomena in time exactly in the same manner as we arrange those of the

external senses in space and consequently if we grant respecting this

latter that by means of them we know objects only in so far as we are affected

externally we must also confess with regard to the internal sense that by

means of it we intuite ourselves only as we are internally affected by

ourselves in other words as regards internal intuition we cognize our own

subject only as phenomenon and not as it is in itself21


 20

motion of an object in space does not belong to a pure science consequently

not to geometry because that a thing is movable cannot be known  priori but

only from experience but motion considered as the description of a space is

a pure act of the successive synthesis of the manifold in external intuition by

means of productive imagination and belongs not only to geometry but even to

transcendental philosophy



 21

i do not see why so much difficulty should be found in admitting that our

internal sense is affected by ourselves every act of attention exemplifies it

in such an act the understanding determines the internal sense by the

synthetical conjunction which it cogitates conformably to the internal

intuition which corresponds to the manifold in the synthesis of the

understanding how much the mind is usually affected thereby every one will be

able to perceive in himself




 21




on the other hand in the transcendental synthesis of the manifold content of

representations consequently in the synthetical unity of apperception i am

conscious of myself not as i appear to myself nor as i am in myself but only

that i am this representation is a thought not an intuition

now as in order to cognize ourselves in addition to the act of thinking

which subjects the manifold of every possible intuition to the unity of

apperception there is necessary a determinate mode of intuition whereby this

manifold is given although my own existence is certainly not mere phenomenon

much less mere illusion the determination of my existence22 can only take place conformably to the

form of the internal sense according to the particular mode in which the

manifold which i conjoin is given in internal intuition and i have therefore

no knowledge of myself as i am but merely as i appear to myself the

consciousness of self is thus very far from a knowledge of self in which i do

not use the categories whereby i cogitate an object by means of the

conjunction of the manifold in one apperception in the same way as i require

for the sake of the cognition of an object distinct from myself not only the

thought of an object in general in the category but also an intuition by

which to determine that general conception in the same way do i require in

order to the cognition of myself not only the consciousness of myself or the

thought that i think myself but in addition an intuition of the manifold in

myself by which to determine this thought it is true that i exist as an

intelligence which is conscious only of its faculty of conjunction or

synthesis but subjected in relation to the manifold which this intelligence

has to conjoin to a limitative conjunction called the internal sense my

intelligence that is i can render that conjunction or synthesis perceptible

only according to the relations of time which are quite beyond the proper

sphere of the conceptions of the understanding and consequently cognize itself

in respect to an intuition which cannot possibly be intellectual nor given by

the understanding only as it appears to itself and not as it would cognize

itself if its intuition were intellectual



 22

the i think expresses the act of determining my own existence my

existence is thus already given by the act of consciousness but the mode in

which i must determine my existence that is the mode in which i must place

the manifold belonging to my existence is not thereby given for this purpose

intuition of self is required and this intuition possesses a form given 

priori namely time which is sensuous and belongs to our receptivity of the

determinable now as i do not possess another intuition of self which gives

the determining in me of the spontaneity of which i am conscious prior to

the act of determination in the same manner as time gives the determinable it

is clear that i am unable to determine my own existence as that of a

spontaneous being but i am only able to represent to myself the spontaneity of

my thought that is of my determination and my existence remains ever

determinable in a purely sensuous manner that is to say like the existence of

a phenomenon but it is because of this spontaneity that i call myself an

intelligence


transcendental deduction of the universally possible

employment in experience of the pure conceptions of the understanding  22


in the metaphysical deduction the  priori origin of categories was proved by

their complete accordance with the general logical of thought in the

transcendental deduction was exhibited the possibility of the categories as 

priori cognitions of objects of an intuition in general  16 and 17at

present we are about to explain the possibility of cognizing  priori by

means of the categories all objects which can possibly be presented to our

senses not indeed according to the form of their intuition but according to

the laws of their conjunction or synthesis and thus as it were of

prescribing laws to nature and even of rendering nature possible for if the

categories were inadequate to this task it would not be evident to us why

everything that is presented to our senses must be subject to those laws which

have an  priori origin in the understanding itself




i premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension i understand the

combination of the manifold in an empirical intuition whereby perception that

is empirical consciousness of the intuition as phenomenon is possible




we have  priori forms of the external and internal sensuous intuition in the

representations of space and time and to these must the synthesis of

apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always comformable because the

synthesis itself can only take place according to these forms but space and

time are not merely forms of sensuous intuition but intuitions themselves

which contain a manifold and therefore contain  priori the determination of

the unity of this manifold23 see the transcendent sthetic

therefore is unity of the synthesis of the manifold without or within us

consequently also a conjunction to which all that is to be represented as

determined in space or time must correspond given  priori along with not in

these intuitions as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension of

them but this synthetical unity can be no other than that of the conjunction

of the manifold of a given intuition in general in a primitive act of

consciousness according to the categories but applied to our sensuous

intuition consequently all synthesis whereby alone is even perception

possible is subject to the categories and as experience is cognition by

means of conjoined perceptions the categories are conditions of the

possibility of experience and are therefore valid  priori for all objects of

experience



 23

space represented as an object as geometry really requires it to be contains

more than the mere form of the intuition namely a combination of the manifold

given according to the form of sensibility into a representation that can be

intuited so that the form of the intuition gives us merely the manifold but

the formal intuition gives unity of representation in the sthetic i regarded

this unity as belonging entirely to sensibility for the purpose of indicating

that it antecedes all conceptions although it presupposes a synthesis which

does not belong to sense through which alone however all our conceptions of

space and time are possible for as by means of this unity alone the

understanding determining the sensibility space and time are given as

intuitions it follows that the unity of this intuition  priori belongs to

space and time and not to the conception of the understanding  20




when then for example i make the empirical intuition of a house by

apprehension of the manifold contained therein into a perception the necessary

unity of space and of my external sensuous intuition lies at the foundation of

this act and i as it were draw the form of the house conformably to this

synthetical unity of the manifold in space but this very synthetical unity

remains even when i abstract the form of space and has its seat in the

understanding and is in fact the category of the synthesis of the homogeneous

in an intuition that is to say the category of quantity to which the

aforesaid synthesis of apprehension that is the perception must be

completely conformable24


 24

in this manner it is proved that the synthesis of apprehension which is

empirical must necessarily be conformable to the synthesis of apperception

which is intellectual and contained  priori in the category it is one and

the same spontaneity which at one time under the name of imagination at

another under that of understanding produces conjunction in the manifold of

intuition




to take another example when i perceive the freezing of water i apprehend two

states fluidity and solidity which as such stand toward each other

mutually in a relation of time but in the time which i place as an internal

intuition at the foundation of this phenomenon i represent to myself

synthetical unity of the manifold without which the aforesaid relation could

not be given in an intuition as determined in regard to the succession of

time now this synthetical unity as the  priori condition under which i

conjoin the manifold of an intuition is if i make abstraction of the

permanent form of my internal intuition that is to say of time the category

of cause by means of which when applied to my sensibility i determine

everything that occurs according to relations of time consequently

apprehension in such an event and the event itself as far as regards the

possibility of its perception stands under the conception of the relation of

cause and effect and so in all other cases




categories are conceptions which prescribe laws  priori to phenomena

consequently to nature as the complex of all phenomena natura materialiter

spectata and now the question arisesinasmuch as these categories are

not derived from nature and do not regulate themselves according to her as

their model for in that case they would be empiricalhow it is

conceivable that nature must regulate herself according to them in other

words how the categories can determine  priori the synthesis of the manifold

of nature and yet not derive their origin from her the following is the

solution of this enigma




it is not in the least more difficult to conceive how the laws of the phenomena

of nature must harmonize with the understanding and with its  priori

formthat is its faculty of conjoining the manifoldthan it is to

understand how the phenomena themselves must correspond with the  priori form

of our sensuous intuition for laws do not exist in the phenomena any more than

the phenomena exist as things in themselves laws do not exist except by

relation to the subject in which the phenomena inhere in so far as it

possesses understanding just as phenomena have no existence except by relation

to the same existing subject in so far as it has senses to things as things in

themselves conformability to law must necessarily belong independently of an

understanding to cognize them but phenomena are only representations of things

which are utterly unknown in respect to what they are in themselves but as

mere representations they stand under no law of conjunction except that which

the conjoining faculty prescribes now that which conjoins the manifold of

sensuous intuition is imagination a mental act to which understanding

contributes unity of intellectual synthesis and sensibility manifoldness of

apprehension now as all possible perception depends on the synthesis of

apprehension and this empirical synthesis itself on the transcendental

consequently on the categories it is evident that all possible perceptions

and therefore everything that can attain to empirical consciousness that is

all phenomena of nature must as regards their conjunction be subject to the

categories and nature considered merely as nature in general is dependent on

them as the original ground of her necessary conformability to law as natura

formaliter spectata but the pure faculty of the understanding of

prescribing laws  priori to phenomena by means of mere categories is not

competent to enounce other or more laws than those on which a nature in

general as a conformability to law of phenomena of space and time depends

particular laws inasmuch as they concern empirically determined phenomena

cannot be entirely deduced from pure laws although they all stand under them

experience must be superadded in order to know these particular laws but in

regard to experience in general and everything that can be cognized as an

object thereof these  priori laws are our only rule and guide


result of this deduction of the conceptions of the

understanding  23


we cannot think any object except by means of the categories we cannot cognize

any thought except by means of intuitions corresponding to these conceptions

now all our intuitions are sensuous and our cognition in so far as the object

of it is given is empirical but empirical cognition is experience

consequently no  priori cognition is possible for us except of objects of

possible experience25


 25

lest my readers should stumble at this assertion and the conclusions that may

be too rashly drawn from it i must remind them that the categories in the act

of thought are by no means limited by the conditions of our sensuous intuition

but have an unbounded sphere of action it is only the cognition of the object

of thought the determining of the object which requires intuition in the

absence of intuition our thought of an object may still have true and useful

consequences in regard to the exercise of reason by the subject but as this

exercise of reason is not always directed on the determination of the object

in other words on cognition thereof but also on the determination of the

subject and its volition i do not intend to treat of it in this place




but this cognition which is limited to objects of experience is not for that

reason derived entirely from experience butand this is asserted of

the pure intuitions and the pure conceptions of the understandingthere

are unquestionably elements of cognition which exist in the mind  priori

now there are only two ways in which a necessary harmony of experience with the

conceptions of its objects can be cogitated either experience makes these

conceptions possible or the conceptions make experience possible the former

of these statements will not hold good with respect to the categories nor in

regard to pure sensuous intuition for they are  priori conceptions and

therefore independent of experience the assertion of an empirical origin would

attribute to them a sort of generatio aequivoca consequently nothing remains

but to adopt the second alternative which presents us with a system as it

were of the epigenesis of pure reason namely that on the part of the

understanding the categories do contain the grounds of the possibility of all

experience but with respect to the questions how they make experience

possible and what are the principles of the possibility thereof with which

they present us in their application to phenomena the following section on the

transcendental exercise of the faculty of judgement will inform the reader




it is quite possible that someone may propose a species of preformationsystem

of pure reasona middle way between the twoto wit that the

categories are neither innate and first  priori principles of cognition nor

derived from experience but are merely subjective aptitudes for thought

implanted in us contemporaneously with our existence which were so ordered and

disposed by our creator that their exercise perfectly harmonizes with the laws

of nature which regulate experience now not to mention that with such an

hypothesis it is impossible to say at what point we must stop in the employment

of predetermined aptitudes the fact that the categories would in this case

entirely lose that character of necessity which is essentially involved in the

very conception of them is a conclusive objection to it the conception of

cause for example which expresses the necessity of an effect under a

presupposed condition would be false if it rested only upon such an arbitrary

subjective necessity of uniting certain empirical representations according to

such a rule of relation i could not then saythe effect is

connected with its cause in the object that is necessarily but only

i am so constituted that i can think this representation as so

connected and not otherwise now this is just what the sceptic wants

for in this case all our knowledge depending on the supposed objective

validity of our judgement is nothing but mere illusion nor would there be

wanting people who would deny any such subjective necessity in respect to

themselves though they must feel it at all events we could not dispute with

any one on that which merely depends on the manner in which his subject is

organized




short view of the above deduction




the foregoing deduction is an exposition of the pure conceptions of the

understanding and with them of all theoretical  priori cognition as

principles of the possibility of experience but of experience as the

determination of all phenomena in space and time in generalof

experience finally from the principle of the original synthetical unity of

apperception as the form of the understanding in relation to time and space as

original forms of sensibility




i consider the division by paragraphs to be necessary only up to this point

because we had to treat of the elementary conceptions as we now proceed to the

exposition of the employment of these i shall not designate the chapters in

this manner any further


book ii analytic of principles


general logic is constructed upon a plan which coincides exactly with the

division of the higher faculties of cognition these are understanding

judgement and reason this science accordingly treats in its analytic of

conceptions judgements and conclusions in exact correspondence with the

functions and order of those mental powers which we include generally under the

generic denomination of understanding




as this merely formal logic makes abstraction of all content of cognition

whether pure or empirical and occupies itself with the mere form of thought

discursive cognition it must contain in its analytic a canon for reason for

the form of reason has its law which without taking into consideration the

particular nature of the cognition about which it is employed can be

discovered  priori by the simple analysis of the action of reason into its

momenta




transcendental logic limited as it is to a determinate content that of pure 

priori cognitions to wit cannot imitate general logic in this division for

it is evident that the transcendental employment of reason is not objectively

valid and therefore does not belong to the logic of truth that is to

analytic but as a logic of illusion occupies a particular department in the

scholastic system under the name of transcendental dialectic




understanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logic a canon

of objectively valid and therefore true exercise and are comprehended in the

analytical department of that logic but reason in her endeavours to arrive by

 priori means at some true statement concerning objects and to extend

cognition beyond the bounds of possible experience is altogether dialectic

and her illusory assertions cannot be constructed into a canon such as an

analytic ought to contain




accordingly the analytic of principles will be merely a canon for the faculty

of judgement for the instruction of this faculty in its application to

phenomena of the pure conceptions of the understanding which contain the

necessary condition for the establishment of  priori laws on this account

although the subject of the following chapters is the especial principles of

understanding i shall make use of the term doctrine of the faculty of

judgement in order to define more particularly my present purpose


introduction of the transcendental faculty of

judgement in general


if understanding in general be defined as the faculty of laws or rules the

faculty of judgement may be termed the faculty of subsumption under these

rules that is of distinguishing whether this or that does or does not stand

under a given rule casus datae legis general logic contains no directions or

precepts for the faculty of judgement nor can it contain any such for as it

makes abstraction of all content of cognition no duty is left for it except

that of exposing analytically the mere form of cognition in conceptions

judgements and conclusions and of thereby establishing formal rules for all

exercise of the understanding now if this logic wished to give some general

direction how we should subsume under these rules that is how we should

distinguish whether this or that did or did not stand under them this again

could not be done otherwise than by means of a rule but this rule precisely

because it is a rule requires for itself direction from the faculty of

judgement thus it is evident that the understanding is capable of being

instructed by rules but that the judgement is a peculiar talent which does

not and cannot require tuition but only exercise this faculty is therefore

the specific quality of the socalled mother wit the want of which no

scholastic discipline can compensate




for although education may furnish and as it were engraft upon a limited

understanding rules borrowed from other minds yet the power of employing these

rules correctly must belong to the pupil himself and no rule which we can

prescribe to him with this purpose is in the absence or deficiency of this

gift of nature secure from misuse26 a physician therefore a judge or a

statesman may have in his head many admirable pathological juridical or

political rules in a degree that may enable him to be a profound teacher in

his particular science and yet in the application of these rules he may very

possibly blundereither because he is wanting in natural judgement

though not in understanding and whilst he can comprehend the general in

abstracto cannot distinguish whether a particular case in concreto ought to

rank under the former or because his faculty of judgement has not been

sufficiently exercised by examples and real practice indeed the grand and

only use of examples is to sharpen the judgement for as regards the

correctness and precision of the insight of the understanding examples are

commonly injurious rather than otherwise because as casus in terminis they

seldom adequately fulfil the conditions of the rule besides they often weaken

the power of our understanding to apprehend rules or laws in their

universality independently of particular circumstances of experience and

hence accustom us to employ them more as formulae than as principles examples

are thus the gocart of the judgement which he who is naturally deficient in

that faculty cannot afford to dispense with



 26

deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called stupidity and for

such a failing we know no remedy a dull or narrowminded person to whom

nothing is wanting but a proper degree of understanding may be improved by

tuition even so far as to deserve the epithet of learned but as such persons

frequently labour under a deficiency in the faculty of judgement it is not

uncommon to find men extremely learned who in the application of their science

betray a lamentable degree this irremediable want




but although general logic cannot give directions to the faculty of judgement

the case is very different as regards transcendental logic insomuch that it

appears to be the especial duty of the latter to secure and direct by means of

determinate rules the faculty of judgement in the employment of the pure

understanding for as a doctrine that is as an endeavour to enlarge the

sphere of the understanding in regard to pure  priori cognitions philosophy

is worse than useless since from all the attempts hitherto made little or no

ground has been gained but as a critique in order to guard against the

mistakes of the faculty of judgement lapsus judicii in the employment of the

few pure conceptions of the understanding which we possess although its use is

in this case purely negative philosophy is called upon to apply all its

acuteness and penetration




but transcendental philosophy has this peculiarity that besides indicating the

rule or rather the general condition for rules which is given in the pure

conception of the understanding it can at the same time indicate  priori

the case to which the rule must be applied the cause of the superiority which

in this respect transcendental philosophy possesses above all other sciences

except mathematics lies in this it treats of conceptions which must relate 

priori to their objects whose objective validity consequently cannot be

demonstrated  posteriori and is at the same time under the obligation of

presenting in general but sufficient tests the conditions under which objects

can be given in harmony with those conceptions otherwise they would be mere

logical forms without content and not pure conceptions of the understanding




our transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement will contain two

chapters the first will treat of the sensuous condition under which alone pure

conceptions of the understanding can be employedthat is of the

schematism of the pure understanding the second will treat of those

synthetical judgements which are derived  priori from pure conceptions of the

understanding under those conditions and which lie  priori at the foundation

of all other cognitions that is to say it will treat of the principles of the

pure understanding


transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement

or analytic of principles
chapter i of the schematism at of the pure

conceptions of the understanding


in all subsumptions of an object under a conception the representation of the

object must be homogeneous with the conception in other words the conception

must contain that which is represented in the object to be subsumed under it

for this is the meaning of the expression an object is contained under

a conception thus the empirical conception of a plate is homogeneous

with the pure geometrical conception of a circle inasmuch as the roundness

which is cogitated in the former is intuited in the latter




but pure conceptions of the understanding when compared with empirical

intuitions or even with sensuous intuitions in general are quite

heterogeneous and never can be discovered in any intuition how then is the

subsumption of the latter under the former and consequently the application of

the categories to phenomena possiblefor it is impossible to say for

example causality can be intuited through the senses and is contained

in the phenomenonthis natural and important question forms the

real cause of the necessity of a transcendental doctrine of the faculty of

judgement with the purpose to wit of showing how pure conceptions of the

understanding can be applied to phenomena in all other sciences where the

conceptions by which the object is thought in the general are not so different

and heterogeneous from those which represent the object in concretoas it

is given it is quite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning

the application of the former to the latter




now it is quite clear that there must be some third thing which on the one

side is homogeneous with the category and with the phenomenon on the other

and so makes the application of the former to the latter possible this

mediating representation must be pure without any empirical content and yet

must on the one side be intellectual on the other sensuous such a

representation is the transcendental schema




the conception of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity of the

manifold in general time as the formal condition of the manifold of the

internal sense consequently of the conjunction of all representations

contains  priori a manifold in the pure intuition now a transcendental

determination of time is so far homogeneous with the category which

constitutes the unity thereof that it is universal and rests upon a rule 

priori on the other hand it is so far homogeneous with the phenomenon

inasmuch as time is contained in every empirical representation of the

manifold thus an application of the category to phenomena becomes possible by

means of the transcendental determination of time which as the schema of the

conceptions of the understanding mediates the subsumption of the latter under

the former




after what has been proved in our deduction of the categories no one it is to

be hoped can hesitate as to the proper decision of the question whether the

employment of these pure conceptions of the understanding ought to be merely

empirical or also transcendental in other words whether the categories as

conditions of a possible experience relate  priori solely to phenomena or

whether as conditions of the possibility of things in general their

application can be extended to objects as things in themselves for we have

there seen that conceptions are quite impossible and utterly without

signification unless either to them or at least to the elements of which they

consist an object be given and that consequently they cannot possibly apply

to objects as things in themselves without regard to the question whether and

how these may be given to us and further that the only manner in which

objects can be given to us is by means of the modification of our sensibility

and finally that pure  priori conceptions in addition to the function of

the understanding in the category must contain  priori formal conditions of

sensibility of the internal sense namely which again contain the general

condition under which alone the category can be applied to any object this

formal and pure condition of sensibility to which the conception of the

understanding is restricted in its employment we shall name the schema of the

conception of the understanding and the procedure of the understanding with

these schemata we shall call the schematism of the pure understanding




the schema is in itself always a mere product of the imagination but as the

synthesis of imagination has for its aim no single intuition but merely unity

in the determination of sensibility the schema is clearly distinguishable from

the image thus if i place five points one after another this is an image

of the number five on the other hand if i only think a number in general

which may be either five or a hundred this thought is rather the

representation of a method of representing in an image a sum eg a thousand

in conformity with a conception than the image itself an image which i should

find some little difficulty in reviewing and comparing with the conception

now this representation of a general procedure of the imagination to present

its image to a conception i call the schema of this conception




in truth it is not images of objects but schemata which lie at the

foundation of our pure sensuous conceptions no image could ever be adequate to

our conception of a triangle in general for the generalness of the conception

it never could attain to as this includes under itself all triangles whether

rightangled acuteangled etc whilst the image would always be limited to a

single part of this sphere the schema of the triangle can exist nowhere else

than in thought and it indicates a rule of the synthesis of the imagination in

regard to pure figures in space still less is an object of experience or an

image of the object ever to the empirical conception on the contrary the

conception always relates immediately to the schema of the imagination as a

rule for the determination of our intuition in conformity with a certain

general conception the conception of a dog indicates a rule according to

which my imagination can delineate the figure of a fourfooted animal in

general without being limited to any particular individual form which

experience presents to me or indeed to any possible image that i can represent

to myself in concreto this schematism of our understanding in regard to

phenomena and their mere form is an art hidden in the depths of the human

soul whose true modes of action we shall only with difficulty discover and

unveil thus much only can we say the image is a product of the

empirical faculty of the productive imaginationthe schema of sensuous

conceptions of figures in space for example is a product and as it were a

monogram of the pure imagination  priori whereby and according to which

images first become possible which however can be connected with the

conception only mediately by means of the schema which they indicate and are

in themselves never fully adequate to it on the other hand the schema

of a pure conception of the understanding is something that cannot be reduced

into any imageit is nothing else than the pure synthesis expressed by

the category conformably to a rule of unity according to conceptions it is a

transcendental product of the imagination a product which concerns the

determination of the internal sense according to conditions of its form time

in respect to all representations in so far as these representations must be

conjoined  priori in one conception conformably to the unity of apperception




without entering upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essential requisites of

transcendental schemata of the pure conceptions of the understanding we shall

rather proceed at once to give an explanation of them according to the order of

the categories and in connection therewith




for the external sense the pure image of all quantities quantorum is space

the pure image of all objects of sense in general is time but the pure schema

of quantity quantitatis as a conception of the understanding is number a

representation which comprehends the successive addition of one to one

homogeneous quantities thus number is nothing else than the unity of the

synthesis of the manifold in a homogeneous intuition by means of my generating

time itself in my apprehension of the intuition




reality in the pure conception of the understanding is that which corresponds

to a sensation in general that consequently the conception of which

indicates a being in time negation is that the conception of which

represents a notbeing in time the opposition of these two consists

therefore in the difference of one and the same time as a time filled or a

time empty now as time is only the form of intuition consequently of objects

as phenomena that which in objects corresponds to sensation is the

transcendental matter of all objects as things in themselves sachheit

reality now every sensation has a degree or quantity by which it can fill

time that is to say the internal sense in respect of the representation of an

object more or less until it vanishes into nothing  0  negatio thus

there is a relation and connection between reality and negation or rather a

transition from the former to the latter which makes every reality

representable to us as a quantum and the schema of a reality as the quantity

of something in so far as it fills time is exactly this continuous and uniform

generation of the reality in time as we descend in time from the sensation

which has a certain degree down to the vanishing thereof or gradually ascend

from negation to the quantity thereof




the schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time that is the

representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determination of time a

substratum which therefore remains whilst all else changes time passes not

but in it passes the existence of the changeable to time therefore which is

itself unchangeable and permanent corresponds that which in the phenomenon is

unchangeable in existence that is substance and it is only by it that the

succession and coexistence of phenomena can be determined in regard to time




the schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which when

posited is always followed by something else it consists therefore in the

succession of the manifold in so far as that succession is subjected to a

rule




the schema of community reciprocity of action and reaction or the reciprocal

causality of substances in respect of their accidents is the coexistence of

the determinations of the one with those of the other according to a general

rule




the schema of possibility is the accordance of the synthesis of different

representations with the conditions of time in general as for example

opposites cannot exist together at the same time in the same thing but only

after each other and is therefore the determination of the representation of

a thing at any time




the schema of reality is existence in a determined time




the schema of necessity is the existence of an object in all time




it is clear from all this that the schema of the category of quantity

contains and represents the generation synthesis of time itself in the

successive apprehension of an object the schema of quality the synthesis of

sensation with the representation of time or the filling up of time the

schema of relation the relation of perceptions to each other in all time that

is according to a rule of the determination of time and finally the schema

of modality and its categories time itself as the correlative of the

determination of an objectwhether it does belong to time and how the

schemata therefore are nothing but  priori determinations of time according

to rules and these in regard to all possible objects following the

arrangement of the categories relate to the series in time the content in

time the order in time and finally to the complex or totality in time




hence it is apparent that the schematism of the understanding by means of the

transcendental synthesis of the imagination amounts to nothing else than the

unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense and thus indirectly

to the unity of apperception as a function corresponding to the internal sense

a receptivity thus the schemata of the pure conceptions of the

understanding are the true and only conditions whereby our understanding

receives an application to objects and consequently significance finally

therefore the categories are only capable of empirical use inasmuch as they

serve merely to subject phenomena to the universal rules of synthesis by means

of an  priori necessary unity on account of the necessary union of all

consciousness in one original apperception and so to render them susceptible

of a complete connection in one experience but within this whole of possible

experience lie all our cognitions and in the universal relation to this

experience consists transcendental truth which antecedes all empirical truth

and renders the latter possible




it is however evident at first sight that although the schemata of

sensibility are the sole agents in realizing the categories they do

nevertheless also restrict them that is they limit the categories by

conditions which lie beyond the sphere of understandingnamely in

sensibility hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon or the sensuous

conception of an object in harmony with the category numerus est quantitas

phaenomenonsensatio realitas phaenomenon constans et perdurabile rerum

substantia phaenomenonaeternitas necessitas phaenomena etc now if

we remove a restrictive condition we thereby amplify it appears the formerly

limited conception in this way the categories in their pure signification

free from all conditions of sensibility ought to be valid of things as they

are and not as the schemata represent them merely as they appear and

consequently the categories must have a significance far more extended and

wholly independent of all schemata in truth there does always remain to the

pure conceptions of the understanding after abstracting every sensuous

condition a value and significance which is however merely logical but in

this case no object is given them and therefore they have no meaning

sufficient to afford us a conception of an object the notion of substance for

example if we leave out the sensuous determination of permanence would mean

nothing more than a something which can be cogitated as subject without the

possibility of becoming a predicate to anything else of this representation i

can make nothing inasmuch as it does not indicate to me what determinations

the thing possesses which must thus be valid as premier subject consequently

the categories without schemata are merely functions of the understanding for

the production of conceptions but do not represent any object this

significance they derive from sensibility which at the same time realizes the

understanding and restricts it


chapter ii system of all principles of the pure

understanding


in the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the general conditions under

which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement is justified in using the

pure conceptions of the understanding for synthetical judgements our duty at

present is to exhibit in systematic connection those judgements which the

understanding really produces  priori for this purpose our table of the

categories will certainly afford us the natural and safe guidance for it is

precisely the categories whose application to possible experience must

constitute all pure  priori cognition of the understanding and the relation

of which to sensibility will on that very account present us with a complete

and systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principles of the use of the

understanding




principles  priori are so called not merely because they contain in

themselves the grounds of other judgements but also because they themselves

are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions this peculiarity

however does not raise them altogether above the need of a proof for although

there could be found no higher cognition and therefore no objective proof and

although such a principle rather serves as the foundation for all cognition of

the object this by no means hinders us from drawing a proof from the

subjective sources of the possibility of the cognition of an object such a

proof is necessary moreover because without it the principle might be liable

to the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion




in the second place we shall limit our investigations to those principles

which relate to the categories for as to the principles of transcendental

sthetic according to which space and time are the conditions of the

possibility of things as phenomena as also the restriction of these

principles namely that they cannot be applied to objects as things in

themselvesthese of course do not fall within the scope of our present

inquiry in like manner the principles of mathematical science form no part of

this system because they are all drawn from intuition and not from the pure

conception of the understanding the possibility of these principles however

will necessarily be considered here inasmuch as they are synthetical

judgements  priori not indeed for the purpose of proving their accuracy and

apodeictic certainty which is unnecessary but merely to render conceivable

and deduce the possibility of such evident  priori cognitions




but we shall have also to speak of the principle of analytical judgements in

opposition to synthetical judgements which is the proper subject of our

inquiries because this very opposition will free the theory of the latter from

all ambiguity and place it clearly before our eyes in its true nature






system of the principles of the pure understanding


section i of the supreme principle of all analytical

judgements


whatever may be the content of our cognition and in whatever manner our

cognition may be related to its object the universal although only negative

conditions of all our judgements is that they do not contradict themselves

otherwise these judgements are in themselves even without respect to the

object nothing but although there may exist no contradiction in our

judgement it may nevertheless connect conceptions in such a manner that they

do not correspond to the object or without any grounds either  priori or 

posteriori for arriving at such a judgement and thus without being

selfcontradictory a judgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless




now the proposition no subject can have a predicate that contradicts

it is called the principle of contradiction and is a universal but

purely negative criterion of all truth but it belongs to logic alone because

it is valid of cognitions merely as cognitions and without respect to their

content and declares that the contradiction entirely nullifies them we can

also however make a positive use of this principle that is not merely to

banish falsehood and error in so far as it rests upon contradiction but also

for the cognition of truth for if the judgement is analytical be it

affirmative or negative its truth must always be recognizable by means of the

principle of contradiction for the contrary of that which lies and is

cogitated as conception in the cognition of the object will be always properly

negatived but the conception itself must always be affirmed of the object

inasmuch as the contrary thereof would be in contradiction to the object




we must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the universal and

fully sufficient principle of all analytical cognition but as a sufficient

criterion of truth it has no further utility or authority for the fact that

no cognition can be at variance with this principle without nullifying itself

constitutes this principle the sine qua non but not the determining ground of

the truth of our cognition as our business at present is properly with the

synthetical part of our knowledge only we shall always be on our guard not to

transgress this inviolable principle but at the same time not to expect from

it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truth of any synthetical

proposition




there exists however a formula of this celebrated principlea principle

merely formal and entirely without contentwhich contains a synthesis

that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up with it it is

this it is impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same

time not to mention the superfluousness of the addition of the word

impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty which ought to be selfevident

from the proposition itself the proposition is affected by the condition of

time and as it were says a thing  a which is something  b cannot

at the same time be nonb but both b as well as nonb may quite well

exist in succession for example a man who is young cannot at the same time be

old but the same man can very well be at one time young and at another not

young that is old now the principle of contradiction as a merely logical

proposition must not by any means limit its application merely to relations of

time and consequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its

true purpose the misunderstanding arises in this way we first of all separate

a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing and afterwards connect

with this predicate its opposite and hence do not establish any contradiction

with the subject but only with its predicate which has been conjoined with

the subject syntheticallya contradiction moreover which obtains only

when the first and second predicate are affirmed in the same time if i say

a man who is ignorant is not learned the condition at the

same time must be added for he who is at one time ignorant may at

another be learned but if i say no ignorant man is a learned

man the proposition is analytical because the characteristic ignorance

is now a constituent part of the conception of the subject and in this case

the negative proposition is evident immediately from the proposition of

contradiction without the necessity of adding the condition the same

time this is the reason why i have altered the formula of this

principlean alteration which shows very clearly the nature of an

analytical proposition


section ii of the supreme principle of all

synthetical judgements


the explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a task with

which general logic has nothing to do indeed she needs not even be acquainted

with its name but in transcendental logic it is the most important matter to

be dealt withindeed the only one if the question is of the possibility

of synthetical judgements  priori the conditions and extent of their

validity for when this question is fully decided it can reach its aim with

perfect ease the determination to wit of the extent and limits of the pure

understanding




in an analytical judgement i do not go beyond the given conception in order to

arrive at some decision respecting it if the judgement is affirmative i

predicate of the conception only that which was already cogitated in it if

negative i merely exclude from the conception its contrary but in synthetical

judgements i must go beyond the given conception in order to cogitate in

relation with it something quite different from that which was cogitated in

it a relation which is consequently never one either of identity or

contradiction and by means of which the truth or error of the judgement cannot

be discerned merely from the judgement itself




granted then that we must go out beyond a given conception in order to

compare it synthetically with another a third thing is necessary in which

alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate now what is this tertium

quid that is to be the medium of all synthetical judgements it is only a

complex in which all our representations are contained the internal sense to

wit and its form  priori time




the synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination their

synthetical unity which is requisite to a judgement upon the unity of

apperception in this therefore is to be sought the possibility of

synthetical judgements and as all three contain the sources of  priori

representations the possibility of pure synthetical judgements also nay they

are necessary upon these grounds if we are to possess a knowledge of objects

which rests solely upon the synthesis of representations




if a cognition is to have objective reality that is to relate to an object

and possess sense and meaning in respect to it it is necessary that the object

be given in some way or another without this our conceptions are empty and

we may indeed have thought by means of them but by such thinking we have not

in fact cognized anything we have merely played with representation to give

an object if this expression be understood in the sense of to

present the object not mediately but immediately in intuition means

nothing else than to apply the representation of it to experience be that

experience real or only possible space and time themselves pure as these

conceptions are from all that is empirical and certain as it is that they are

represented fully  priori in the mind would be completely without objective

validity and without sense and significance if their necessary use in the

objects of experience were not shown nay the representation of them is a mere

schema that always relates to the reproductive imagination which calls up the

objects of experience without which they have no meaning and so it is with

all conceptions without distinction




the possibility of experience is then that which gives objective reality to

all our  priori cognitions now experience depends upon the synthetical unity

of phenomena that is upon a synthesis according to conceptions of the object

of phenomena in general a synthesis without which experience never could

become knowledge but would be merely a rhapsody of perceptions never fitting

together into any connected text according to rules of a thoroughly united

possible consciousness and therefore never subjected to the transcendental

and necessary unity of apperception experience has therefore for a foundation

 priori principles of its form that is to say general rules of unity in the

synthesis of phenomena the objective reality of which rules as necessary

conditions even of the possibility of experience can which rules as necessary

conditionseven of the possibility of experiencecan always be

shown in experience but apart from this relation  priori synthetical

propositions are absolutely impossible because they have no third term that

is no pure object in which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective

reality of its conceptions




although then respecting space or the forms which productive imagination

describes therein we do cognize much  priori in synthetical judgements and

are really in no need of experience for this purpose such knowledge would

nevertheless amount to nothing but a busy trifling with a mere chimera were

not space to be considered as the condition of the phenomena which constitute

the material of external experience hence those pure synthetical judgements do

relate though but mediately to possible experience or rather to the

possibility of experience and upon that alone is founded the objective

validity of their synthesis




while then on the one hand experience as empirical synthesis is the only

possible mode of cognition which gives reality to all other synthesis on the

other hand this latter synthesis as cognition  priori possesses truth that

is accordance with its object only in so far as it contains nothing more than

what is necessary to the synthetical unity of experience




accordingly the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements is

every object is subject to the necessary conditions of the synthetical

unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience




 priori synthetical judgements are possible when we apply the formal

conditions of the  priori intuition the synthesis of the imagination and the

necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendental apperception to a

possible cognition of experience and say the conditions of the

possibility of experience in general are at the same time conditions of the

possibility of the objects of experience and have for that reason objective

validity in an  priori synthetical judgement


section iii systematic representation of all

synthetical principles of the pure understanding


that principles exist at all is to be ascribed solely to the pure

understanding which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to that which

happens but is even the source of principles according to which everything

that can be presented to us as an object is necessarily subject to rules

because without such rules we never could attain to cognition of an object

even the laws of nature if they are contemplated as principles of the

empirical use of the understanding possess also a characteristic of necessity

and we may therefore at least expect them to be determined upon grounds which

are valid  priori and antecedent to all experience but all laws of nature

without distinction are subject to higher principles of the understanding

inasmuch as the former are merely applications of the latter to particular

cases of experience these higher principles alone therefore give the

conception which contains the necessary condition and as it were the

exponent of a rule experience on the other hand gives the case which comes

under the rule




there is no danger of our mistaking merely empirical principles for principles

of the pure understanding or conversely for the character of necessity

according to conceptions which distinguish the latter and the absence of this

in every empirical proposition how extensively valid soever it may be is a

perfect safeguard against confounding them there are however pure principles

 priori which nevertheless i should not ascribe to the pure

understandingfor this reason that they are not derived from pure

conceptions but although by the mediation of the understanding from pure

intuitions but understanding is the faculty of conceptions such principles

mathematical science possesses but their application to experience

consequently their objective validity nay the possibility of such  priori

synthetical cognitions the deduction thereof rests entirely upon the pure

understanding




on this account i shall not reckon among my principles those of mathematics

though i shall include those upon the possibility and objective validity 

priori of principles of the mathematical science which consequently are to

be looked upon as the principle of these and which proceed from conceptions to

intuition and not from intuition to conceptions




in the application of the pure conceptions of the understanding to possible

experience the employment of their synthesis is either mathematical or

dynamical for it is directed partly on the intuition alone partly on the

existence of a phenomenon but the  priori conditions of intuition are in

relation to a possible experience absolutely necessary those of the existence

of objects of a possible empirical intuition are in themselves contingent

hence the principles of the mathematical use of the categories will possess a

character of absolute necessity that is will be apodeictic those on the

other hand of the dynamical use the character of an  priori necessity

indeed but only under the condition of empirical thought in an experience

therefore only mediately and indirectly consequently they will not possess

that immediate evidence which is peculiar to the former although their

application to experience does not for that reason lose its truth and

certitude but of this point we shall be better able to judge at the conclusion

of this system of principles




the table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table of principles

because these are nothing else than rules for the objective employment of the

former accordingly all principles of the pure understanding are




                                1

                              axioms

                           of intuition



               2                                    3

          anticipations                          analogies

          of perception                        of experience

                                4

                          postulates of

                        empirical thought

                           in general




these appellations i have chosen advisedly in order that we might not lose

sight of the distinctions in respect of the evidence and the employment of

these principles it will however soon appear thata fact which

concerns both the evidence of these principles and the  priori determination

of phenomenaaccording to the categories of quantity and quality if we

attend merely to the form of these the principles of these categories are

distinguishable from those of the two others in as much as the former are

possessed of an intuitive but the latter of a merely discursive though in

both instances a complete certitude i shall therefore call the former

mathematical and the latter dynamical principles27 it must be

observed however that by these terms i mean just as little in the one case

the principles of mathematics as those of general physical dynamics in the

other i have here in view merely the principles of the pure understanding in

their application to the internal sense without distinction of the

representations given therein by means of which the sciences of mathematics

and dynamics become possible accordingly i have named these principles rather

with reference to their application than their content and i shall now proceed

to consider them in the order in which they stand in the table



 27

all combination conjunctio is either composition compositio or connection

nexus the former is the synthesis of a manifold the parts of which do not

necessarily belong to each other for example the two triangles into which a

square is divided by a diagonal do not necessarily belong to each other and

of this kind is the synthesis of the homogeneous in everything that can be

mathematically considered this synthesis can be divided into those of

aggregation and coalition the former of which is applied to extensive the

latter to intensive quantities the second sort of combination nexus is the

synthesis of a manifold in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each

other for example the accident to a substance or the effect to the cause

consequently it is a synthesis of that which though heterogeneous is

represented as connected  priori this combinationnot an arbitrary

onei entitle dynamical because it concerns the connection of the

existence of the manifold this again may be divided into the physical

synthesis of the phenomena divided among each other and the metaphysical

synthesis or the connection of phenomena  priori in the faculty of cognition




1 axioms of intuition




the principle of these is all intuitions are extensive quantities




proof




all phenomena contain as regards their form an intuition in space and time

which lies  priori at the foundation of all without exception phenomena

therefore cannot be apprehended that is received into empirical

consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of a manifold through which

the representations of a determinate space or time are generated that is to

say through the composition of the homogeneous and the consciousness of the

synthetical unity of this manifold homogeneous now the consciousness of a

homogeneous manifold in intuition in so far as thereby the representation of

an object is rendered possible is the conception of a quantity quanti

consequently even the perception of an object as phenomenon is possible only

through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the given sensuous

intuition through which the unity of the composition of the homogeneous

manifold in the conception of a quantity is cogitated that is to say all

phenomena are quantities and extensive quantities because as intuitions in

space or time they must be represented by means of the same synthesis through

which space and time themselves are determined




an extensive quantity i call that wherein the representation of the parts

renders possible and therefore necessarily antecedes the representation of

the whole i cannot represent to myself any line however small without

drawing it in thought that is without generating from a point all its parts

one after another and in this way alone producing this intuition precisely

the same is the case with every even the smallest portion of time i cogitate

therein only the successive progress from one moment to another and hence by

means of the different portions of time and the addition of them a determinate

quantity of time is produced as the pure intuition in all phenomena is either

time or space so is every phenomenon in its character of intuition an

extensive quantity inasmuch as it can only be cognized in our apprehension by

successive synthesis from part to part all phenomena are accordingly to be

considered as aggregates that is as a collection of previously given parts

which is not the case with every sort of quantities but only with those which

are represented and apprehended by us as extensive




on this successive synthesis of the productive imagination in the generation

of figures is founded the mathematics of extension or geometry with its

axioms which express the conditions of sensuous intuition  priori under

which alone the schema of a pure conception of external intuition can exist

for example be tween two points only one straight line is

possible two straight lines cannot enclose a space etc

these are the axioms which properly relate only to quantities quanta as such




but as regards the quantity of a thing quantitas that is to say the answer

to the question how large is this or that object although in

respect to this question we have various propositions synthetical and

immediately certain indemonstrabilia we have in the proper sense of the

term no axioms for example the propositions if equals be added to

equals the wholes are equal if equals be taken from equals the

remainders are equal are analytical because i am immediately conscious

of the identity of the production of the one quantity with the production of

the other whereas axioms must be  priori synthetical propositions on the

other hand the selfevident propositions as to the relation of numbers are

certainly synthetical but not universal like those of geometry and for this

reason cannot be called axioms but numerical formulae that 7  5  12 is not

an analytical proposition for neither in the representation of seven nor of

five nor of the composition of the two numbers do i cogitate the number

twelve whether i cogitate the number in the addition of both is not at

present the question for in the case of an analytical proposition the only

point is whether i really cogitate the predicate in the representation of the

subject but although the proposition is synthetical it is nevertheless only

a singular proposition in so far as regard is here had merely to the synthesis

of the homogeneous the units it cannot take place except in one manner

although our use of these numbers is afterwards general if i say a

triangle can be constructed with three lines any two of which taken together

are greater than the third i exercise merely the pure function of the

productive imagination which may draw the lines longer or shorter and

construct the angles at its pleasure on the contrary the number seven is

possible only in one manner and so is likewise the number twelve which

results from the synthesis of seven and five such propositions then cannot

be termed axioms for in that case we should have an infinity of these but

numerical formulae




this transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatly enlarges

our  priori cognition for it is by this principle alone that pure mathematics

is rendered applicable in all its precision to objects of experience and

without it the validity of this application would not be so selfevident on

the contrary contradictions and confusions have often arisen on this very

point phenomena are not things in themselves empirical intuition is possible

only through pure intuition of space and time consequently what geometry

affirms of the latter is indisputably valid of the former all evasions such

as the statement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules of

construction in space for example to the rule of the infinite divisibility of

lines or angles must fall to the ground for if these objections hold good

we deny to space and with it to all mathematics objective validity and no

longer know wherefore and how far mathematics can be applied to phenomena

the synthesis of spaces and times as the essential form of all intuition is

that which renders possible the apprehension of a phenomenon and therefore

every external experience consequently all cognition of the objects of

experience and whatever mathematics in its pure use proves of the former must

necessarily hold good of the latter all objections are but the chicaneries of

an illinstructed reason which erroneously thinks to liberate the objects of

sense from the formal conditions of our sensibility and represents these

although mere phenomena as things in themselves presented as such to our

understanding but in this case no  priori synthetical cognition of them

could be possible consequently not through pure conceptions of space and the

science which determines these conceptions that is to say geometry would

itself be impossible




2 anticipations of perception




the principle of these is in all phenomena the real that which is an object

of sensation has intensive quantity that is has a degree




proof




perception is empirical consciousness that is to say a consciousness which

contains an element of sensation phenomena as objects of perception are not

pure that is merely formal intuitions like space and time for they cannot

be perceived in themselves28 they contain then over and above the

intuition the materials for an object through which is represented something

existing in space or time that is to say they contain the real of sensation

as a representation merely subjective which gives us merely the consciousness

that the subject is affected and which we refer to some external object now

a gradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousness is

possible inasmuch as the real in this consciousness entirely vanishes and

there remains a merely formal consciousness  priori of the manifold in time

and space consequently there is possible a synthesis also of the production of

the quantity of a sensation from its commencement that is from the pure

intuition  0 onwards up to a certain quantity of the sensation now as

sensation in itself is not an objective representation and in it is to be

found neither the intuition of space nor of time it cannot possess any

extensive quantity and yet there does belong to it a quantity and that by

means of its apprehension in which empirical consciousness can within a

certain time rise from nothing  0 up to its given amount consequently an

intensive quantity and thus we must ascribe intensive quantity that is a

degree of influence on sense to all objects of perception in so far as this

perception contains sensation



 28

they can be perceived only as phenomena and some part of them must always

belong to the nonego whereas pure intuitions are entirely the products of the

mind itself and as such are cognized in themselvestr



all cognition by means of which i am enabled to cognize and determine  priori

what belongs to empirical cognition may be called an anticipation and without

doubt this is the sense in which epicurus employed his expression prholepsis

but as there is in phenomena something which is never cognized  priori which

on this account constitutes the proper difference between pure and empirical

cognition that is to say sensation as the matter of perception it follows

that sensation is just that element in cognition which cannot be at all

anticipated on the other hand we might very well term the pure determinations

in space and time as well in regard to figure as to quantity anticipations of

phenomena because they represent  priori that which may always be given 

posteriori in experience but suppose that in every sensation as sensation in

general without any particular sensation being thought of there existed

something which could be cognized  priori this would deserve to be called

anticipation in a special sensespecial because it may seem surprising

to forestall experience in that which concerns the matter of experience and

which we can only derive from itself yet such really is the case here




apprehension29 by means of sensation alone fills

only one moment that is if i do not take into consideration a succession of

many sensations as that in the phenomenon the apprehension of which is not a

successive synthesis advancing from parts to an entire representation

sensation has therefore no extensive quantity the want of sensation in a

moment of time would represent it as empty consequently  0 that which in the

empirical intuition corresponds to sensation is reality realitas phaenomenon

that which corresponds to the absence of it negation  0 now every sensation

is capable of a diminution so that it can decrease and thus gradually

disappear therefore between reality in a phenomenon and negation there

exists a continuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensations the

difference of which from each other is always smaller than that between the

given sensation and zero or complete negation that is to say the real in a

phenomenon has always a quantity which however is not discoverable in

apprehension inasmuch as apprehension take place by means of mere sensation in

one instant and not by the successive synthesis of many sensations and

therefore does not progress from parts to the whole consequently it has a

quantity but not an extensive quantity



 29

apprehension is the kantian word for preception in the largest sense in which

we employ that term it is the genus which includes under i as species

perception proper and sensation propertr




now that quantity which is apprehended only as unity and in which plurality

can be represented only by approximation to negation  o i term intensive

quantity consequently reality in a phenomenon has intensive quantity that

is a degree if we consider this reality as cause be it of sensation or of

another reality in the phenomenon for example a change we call the degree

of reality in its character of cause a momentum for example the momentum of

weight and for this reason that the degree only indicates that quantity the

apprehension of which is not successive but instantaneous this however i

touch upon only in passing for with causality i have at present nothing to do




accordingly every sensation consequently every reality in phenomena however

small it may be has a degree that is an intensive quantity which may always

be lessened and between reality and negation there exists a continuous

connection of possible realities and possible smaller perceptions every

colourfor example redhas a degree which be it ever so small

is never the smallest and so is it always with heat the momentum of weight

etc




this property of quantities according to which no part of them is the smallest

possible no part simple is called their continuity space and time are

quanta continua because no part of them can be given without enclosing it

within boundaries points and moments consequently this given part is itself

a space or a time space therefore consists only of spaces and time of

times points and moments are only boundaries that is the mere places or

positions of their limitation but places always presuppose intuitions which

are to limit or determine them and we cannot conceive either space or time

composed of constituent parts which are given before space or time such

quantities may also be called flowing because synthesis of the productive

imagination in the production of these quantities is a progression in time

the continuity of which we are accustomed to indicate by the expression

flowing




all phenomena then are continuous quantities in respect both to intuition

and mere perception sensation and with it reality in the former case they

are extensive quantities in the latter intensive when the synthesis of the

manifold of a phenomenon is interrupted there results merely an aggregate of

several phenomena and not properly a phenomenon as a quantity which is not

produced by the mere continuation of the productive synthesis of a certain

kind but by the repetition of a synthesis always ceasing for example if i

call thirteen dollars a sum or quantity of money i employ the term quite

correctly inasmuch as i understand by thirteen dollars the value of a mark in

standard silver which is to be sure a continuous quantity in which no part

is the smallest but every part might constitute a piece of money which would

contain material for still smaller pieces if however by the words thirteen

dollars i understand so many coins be their value in silver what it may it

would be quite erroneous to use the expression a quantity of dollars on the

contrary i must call them aggregate that is a number of coins and as in

every number we must have unity as the foundation so a phenomenon taken as

unity is a quantity and as such always a continuous quantity quantum

continuum




now seeing all phenomena whether considered as extensive or intensive are

continuous quantities the proposition all change transition of a

thing from one state into another is continuous might be proved here

easily and with mathematical evidence were it not that the causality of a

change lies entirely beyond the bounds of a transcendental philosophy and

presupposes empirical principles for of the possibility of a cause which

changes the condition of things that is which determines them to the contrary

to a certain given state the understanding gives us  priori no knowledge not

merely because it has no insight into the possibility of it for such insight

is absent in several  priori cognitions but because the notion of change

concerns only certain determinations of phenomena which experience alone can

acquaint us with while their cause lies in the unchangeable but seeing that

we have nothing which we could here employ but the pure fundamental conceptions

of all possible experience among which of course nothing empirical can be

admitted we dare not without injuring the unity of our system anticipate

general physical science which is built upon certain fundamental experiences




nevertheless we are in no want of proofs of the great influence which the

principle above developed exercises in the anticipation of perceptions and

even in supplying the want of them so far as to shield us against the false

conclusions which otherwise we might rashly draw




if all reality in perception has a degree between which and negation there is

an endless sequence of ever smaller degrees and if nevertheless every sense

must have a determinate degree of receptivity for sensations no perception

and consequently no experience is possible which can prove either immediately

or mediately an entire absence of all reality in a phenomenon in other words

it is impossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of empty

space or of empty time for in the first place an entire absence of reality in

a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object of perception secondly

such absence cannot be deduced from the contemplation of any single phenomenon

and the difference of the degrees in its reality nor ought it ever to be

admitted in explanation of any phenomenon for if even the complete intuition

of a determinate space or time is thoroughly real that is if no part thereof

is empty yet because every reality has its degree which with the extensive

quantity of the phenomenon unchanged can diminish through endless gradations

down to nothing the void there must be infinitely graduated degrees with

which space or time is filled and the intensive quantity in different

phenomena may be smaller or greater although the extensive quantity of the

intuition remains equal and unaltered




we shall give an example of this almost all natural philosophers remarking a

great difference in the quantity of the matter of different kinds in bodies

with the same volume partly on account of the momentum of gravity or weight

partly on account of the momentum of resistance to other bodies in motion

conclude unanimously that this volume extensive quantity of the phenomenon

must be void in all bodies although in different proportion but who would

suspect that these for the most part mathematical and mechanical inquirers into

nature should ground this conclusion solely on a metaphysical

hypothesisa sort of hypothesis which they profess to disparage and

avoid yet this they do in assuming that the real in space i must not here

call it impenetrability or weight because these are empirical conceptions is

always identical and can only be distinguished according to its extensive

quantity that is multiplicity now to this presupposition for which they can

have no ground in experience and which consequently is merely metaphysical i

oppose a transcendental demonstration which it is true will not explain the

difference in the filling up of spaces but which nevertheless completely does

away with the supposed necessity of the abovementioned presupposition that we

cannot explain the said difference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty

spaces this demonstration moreover has the merit of setting the

understanding at liberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner if

the explanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis for we perceive that

although two equal spaces may be completely filled by matters altogether

different so that in neither of them is there left a single point wherein

matter is not present nevertheless every reality has its degree of

resistance or of weight which without diminution of the extensive quantity

can become less and less ad infinitum before it passes into nothingness and

disappears thus an expansion which fills a spacefor example caloric

or any other reality in the phenomenal worldcan decrease in its degrees

to infinity yet without leaving the smallest part of the space empty on the

contrary filling it with those lesser degrees as completely as another

phenomenon could with greater my intention here is by no means to maintain

that this is really the case with the difference of matters in regard to their

specific gravity i wish only to prove from a principle of the pure

understanding that the nature of our perceptions makes such a mode of

explanation possible and that it is erroneous to regard the real in a

phenomenon as equal quoad its degree and different only quoad its aggregation

and extensive quantity and this too on the pretended authority of an 

priori principle of the understanding




nevertheless this principle of the anticipation of perception must somewhat

startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental philosophy has rendered

cautious we must naturally entertain some doubt whether or not the

understanding can enounce any such synthetical proposition as that respecting

the degree of all reality in phenomena and consequently the possibility of the

internal difference of sensation itselfabstraction being made of its

empirical quality thus it is a question not unworthy of solution how

the understanding can pronounce synthetically and  priori respecting

phenomena and thus anticipate these even in that which is peculiarly and

merely empirical that namely which concerns sensation itself




the quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical and cannot be

represented  priori for example colours taste etc but the

realthat which corresponds to sensationin opposition to negation

 0 only represents something the conception of which in itself contains a

being ein seyn and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical

consciousness that is to say the empirical consciousness in the internal

sense can be raised from 0 to every higher degree so that the very same

extensive quantity of intuition an illuminated surface for example excites

as great a sensation as an aggregate of many other surfaces less illuminated

we can therefore make complete abstraction of the extensive quantity of a

phenomenon and represent to ourselves in the mere sensation in a certain

momentum a synthesis of homogeneous ascension from 0 up to the given empirical

consciousness all sensations therefore as such are given only  posteriori

but this property thereof namely that they have a degree can be known 

priori it is worthy of remark that in respect to quantities in general we

can cognize  priori only a single quality namely continuity but in respect

to all quality the real in phenomena we cannot cognize  priori anything

more than the intensive quantity thereof namely that they have a degree all

else is left to experience




3 analogies of experience




the principle of these is experience is possible only through the

representation of a necessary connection of perceptions




proof




experience is an empirical cognition that is to say a cognition which

determines an object by means of perceptions it is therefore a synthesis of

perceptions a synthesis which is not itself contained in perception but which

contains the synthetical unity of the manifold of perception in a

consciousness and this unity constitutes the essential of our cognition of

objects of the senses that is of experience not merely of intuition or

sensation now in experience our perceptions come together contingently so

that no character of necessity in their connection appears or can appear from

the perceptions themselves because apprehension is only a placing together of

the manifold of empirical intuition and no representation of a necessity in

the connected existence of the phenomena which apprehension brings together is

to be discovered therein but as experience is a cognition of objects by means

of perceptions it follows that the relation of the existence of the existence

of the manifold must be represented in experience not as it is put together in

time but as it is objectively in time and as time itself cannot be perceived

the determination of the existence of objects in time can only take place by

means of their connection in time in general consequently only by means of 

priori connecting conceptions now as these conceptions always possess the

character of necessity experience is possible only by means of a

representation of the necessary connection of perception




the three modi of time are permanence succession and coexistence

accordingly there are three rules of all relations of time in phenomena

according to which the existence of every phenomenon is determined in respect

of the unity of all time and these antecede all experience and render it

possible




the general principle of all three analogies rests on the necessary unity of

apperception in relation to all possible empirical consciousness perception

at every time consequently as this unity lies  priori at the foundation of

all mental operations the principle rests on the synthetical unity of all

phenomena according to their relation in time for the original apperception

relates to our internal sense the complex of all representations and indeed

relates  priori to its form that is to say the relation of the manifold

empirical consciousness in time now this manifold must be combined in original

apperception according to relations of timea necessity imposed by the 

priori transcendental unity of apperception to which is subjected all that can

belong to my ie my own cognition and therefore all that can become an

object for me this synthetical and  priori determined unity in relation of

perceptions in time is therefore the rule all empirical determinations

of time must be subject to rules of the general determination of time

and the analogies of experience of which we are now about to treat must be

rules of this nature




these principles have this peculiarity that they do not concern phenomena and

the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof but merely the existence of

phenomena and their relation to each other in regard to this existence now the

mode in which we apprehend a thing in a phenomenon can be determined  priori

in such a manner that the rule of its synthesis can give that is to say can

produce this  priori intuition in every empirical example but the existence

of phenomena cannot be known  priori and although we could arrive by this

path at a conclusion of the fact of some existence we could not cognize that

existence determinately that is to say we should be incapable of anticipating

in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be distinguishable from

that of others




the two principles above mentioned which i called mathematical in

consideration of the fact of their authorizing the application of mathematic

phenomena relate to these phenomena only in regard to their possibility and

instruct us how phenomena as far as regards their intuition or the real in

their perception can be generated according to the rules of a mathematical

synthesis consequently numerical quantities and with them the determination

of a phenomenon as a quantity can be employed in the one case as well as in

the other thus for example out of 200000 illuminations by the moon i might

compose and give  priori that is construct the degree of our sensations of

the sunlight30 we may therefore entitle these two

principles constitutive



 30

kants meaning is the two principles enunciated under the heads of

axioms of intuition and anticipations of

perception authorize the application to phenomena of determinations of

size and number that is of mathematic for example i may compute the light of

the sun and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater than

that of the moon in the same way heat is measured by the comparison of its

different effects on water c and on mercury in a thermometertr




the case is very different with those principles whose province it is to

subject the existence of phenomena to rules  priori for as existence does not

admit of being constructed it is clear that they must only concern the

relations of existence and be merely regulative principles in this case

therefore neither axioms nor anticipations are to be thought of thus if a

perception is given us in a certain relation of time to other although

undetermined perceptions we cannot then say  priori what and how great in

quantity the other perception necessarily connected with the former is but

only how it is connected quoad its existence in this given modus of time

analogies in philosophy mean something very different from that which they

represent in mathematics in the latter they are formulae which enounce the

equality of two relations of quantity and are always constitutive so that if

two terms of the proportion are given the third is also given that is can be

constructed by the aid of these formulae but in philosophy analogy is not the

equality of two quantitative but of two qualitative relations in this case

from three given terms i can give  priori and cognize the relation to a

fourth member but not this fourth term itself although i certainly possess a

rule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience and a mark

to assist me in discovering it an analogy of experience is therefore only a

rule according to which unity of experience must arise out of perceptions in

respect to objects phenomena not as a constitutive but merely as a

regulative principle the same holds good also of the postulates of empirical

thought in general which relate to the synthesis of mere intuition which

concerns the form of phenomena the synthesis of perception which concerns

the matter of phenomena and the synthesis of experience which concerns the

relation of these perceptions for they are only regulative principles and

clearly distinguishable from the mathematical which are constitutive not

indeed in regard to the certainty which both possess  priori but in the mode

of evidence thereof consequently also in the manner of demonstration




but what has been observed of all synthetical propositions and must be

particularly remarked in this place is this that these analogies possess

significance and validity not as principles of the transcendental but only as

principles of the empirical use of the understanding and their truth can

therefore be proved only as such and that consequently the phenomena must not

be subjoined directly under the categories but only under their schemata for

if the objects to which those principles must be applied were things in

themselves it would be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them

synthetically  priori but they are nothing but phenomena a complete

knowledge of whicha knowledge to which all principles  priori must at

last relateis the only possible experience it follows that these

principles can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of the

empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena but this synthesis

is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception of the understanding of

whose unity as that of a synthesis in general the category contains the

function unrestricted by any sensuous condition these principles will

therefore authorize us to connect phenomena according to an analogy with the

logical and universal unity of conceptions and consequently to employ the

categories in the principles themselves but in the application of them to

experience we shall use only their schemata as the key to their proper

application instead of the categories or rather the latter as restricting

conditions under the title of formulae of the former




a first analogy




principle of the permanence of substance




in all changes of phenomena substance is permanent and the quantum thereof in

nature is neither increased nor diminished




proof




all phenomena exist in time wherein alone as substratum that is as the

permanent form of the internal intuition coexistence and succession can be

represented consequently time in which all changes of phenomena must be

cogitated remains and changes not because it is that in which succession and

coexistence can be represented only as determinations thereof now time in

itself cannot be an object of perception it follows that in objects of

perception that is in phenomena there must be found a substratum which

represents time in general and in which all change or coexistence can be

perceived by means of the relation of phenomena to it but the substratum of

all reality that is of all that pertains to the existence of things is

substance all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as a

determination of substance consequently the permanent in relation to which

alone can all relations of time in phenomena be determined is substance in the

world of phenomena that is the real in phenomena that which as the

substratum of all change remains ever the same accordingly as this cannot

change in existence its quantity in nature can neither be increased nor

diminished




our apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive is

consequently always changing by it alone we could therefore never determine

whether this manifold as an object of experience is coexistent or successive

unless it had for a foundation something fixed and permanent of the existence

of which all succession and coexistence are nothing but so many modes modi of

time only in the permanent then are relations of time possible for

simultaneity and succession are the only relations in time that is to say

the permanent is the substratum of our empirical representation of time itself

in which alone all determination of time is possible permanence is in fact

just another expression for time as the abiding correlate of all existence of

phenomena and of all change and of all coexistence for change does not

affect time itself but only the phenomena in time just as coexistence cannot

be regarded as a modus of time itself seeing that in time no parts are

coexistent but all successive if we were to attribute succession to time

itself we should be obliged to cogitate another time in which this succession

would be possible it is only by means of the permanent that existence in

different parts of the successive series of time receives a quantity which we

entitle duration for in mere succession existence is perpetually vanishing

and recommencing and therefore never has even the least quantity without the

permanent then no relation in time is possible now time in itself is not an

object of perception consequently the permanent in phenomena must be regarded

as the substratum of all determination of time and consequently also as the

condition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions that is

of experience and all existence and all change in time can only be regarded as

a mode in the existence of that which abides unchangeably therefore in all

phenomena the permanent is the object in itself that is the substance

phenomenon but all that changes or can change belongs only to the mode of

the existence of this substance or substances consequently to its

determinations




i find that in all ages not only the philosopher but even the common

understanding has preposited this permanence as a substratum of all change in

phenomena indeed i am compelled to believe that they will always accept this

as an indubitable fact only the philosopher expresses himself in a more

precise and definite manner when he says in all changes in the world

the substance remains and the accidents alone are changeable but of

this decidedly synthetical proposition i nowhere meet with even an attempt at

proof nay it very rarely has the good fortune to stand as it deserves to do

at the head of the pure and entirely  priori laws of nature in truth the

statement that substance is permanent is tautological for this very

permanence is the ground on which we apply the category of substance to the

phenomenon and we should have been obliged to prove that in all phenomena

there is something permanent of the existence of which the changeable is

nothing but a determination but because a proof of this nature cannot be

dogmatical that is cannot be drawn from conceptions inasmuch as it concerns

a synthetical proposition  priori and as philosophers never reflected that

such propositions are valid only in relation to possible experience and

therefore cannot be proved except by means of a deduction of the possibility of

experience it is no wonder that while it has served as the foundation of all

experience for we feel the need of it in empirical cognition it has never

been supported by proof




a philosopher was asked what is the weight of smoke he

answered subtract from the weight of the burnt wood the weight of the

remaining ashes and you will have the weight of the smoke thus he

presumed it to be incontrovertible that even in fire the matter substance

does not perish but that only the form of it undergoes a change in like

manner was the saying from nothing comes nothing only another

inference from the principle or permanence or rather of the everabiding

existence of the true subject in phenomena for if that in the phenomenon which

we call substance is to be the proper substratum of all determination of time

it follows that all existence in past as well as in future time must be

determinable by means of it alone hence we are entitled to apply the term

substance to a phenomenon only because we suppose its existence in all time a

notion which the word permanence does not fully express as it seems rather to

be referable to future time however the internal necessity perpetually to be

is inseparably connected with the necessity always to have been and so the

expression may stand as it is gigni de nihilo nihil in nihilum nil

posse reverti31 are two propositions which the ancients

never parted and which people nowadays sometimes mistakenly disjoin because

they imagine that the propositions apply to objects as things in themselves

and that the former might be inimical to the dependence even in respect of its

substance also of the world upon a supreme cause but this apprehension is

entirely needless for the question in this case is only of phenomena in the

sphere of experience the unity of which never could be possible if we

admitted the possibility that new things in respect of their substance should

arise for in that case we should lose altogether that which alone can

represent the unity of time to wit the identity of the substratum as that

through which alone all change possesses complete and thorough unity this

permanence is however nothing but the manner in which we represent to

ourselves the existence of things in the phenomenal world



 31

persius satirae iii8384




the determinations of a substance which are only particular modes of its

existence are called accidents they are always real because they concern the

existence of substance negations are only determinations which express the

nonexistence of something in the substance now if to this real in the

substance we ascribe a particular existence for example to motion as an

accident of matter this existence is called inherence in contradistinction

to the existence of substance which we call subsistence but hence arise many

misconceptions and it would be a more accurate and just mode of expression to

designate the accident only as the mode in which the existence of a substance

is positively determined meanwhile by reason of the conditions of the logical

exercise of our understanding it is impossible to avoid separating as it

were that which in the existence of a substance is subject to change whilst

the substance remains and regarding it in relation to that which is properly

permanent and radical on this account this category of substance stands under

the title of relation rather because it is the condition thereof than because

it contains in itself any relation




now upon this notion of permanence rests the proper notion of the conception

change origin and extinction are not changes of that which originates or

becomes extinct change is but a mode of existence which follows on another

mode of existence of the same object hence all that changes is permanent and

only the condition thereof changes now since this mutation affects only

determinations which can have a beginning or an end we may say employing an

expression which seems somewhat paradoxical only the permanent

substance is subject to change the mutable suffers no change but rather

alternation that is when certain determinations cease others begin




change when cannot be perceived by us except in substances and origin or

extinction in an absolute sense that does not concern merely a determination

of the permanent cannot be a possible perception for it is this very notion

of the permanent which renders possible the representation of a transition from

one state into another and from nonbeing to being which consequently can

be empirically cognized only as alternating determinations of that which is

permanent grant that a thing absolutely begins to be we must then have a

point of time in which it was not but how and by what can we fix and determine

this point of time unless by that which already exists for a void

timeprecedingis not an object of perception but if we connect

this beginning with objects which existed previously and which continue to

exist till the object in question in question begins to be then the latter can

only be a determination of the former as the permanent the same holds good of

the notion of extinction for this presupposes the empirical representation of

a time in which a phenomenon no longer exists




substances in the world of phenomena are the substratum of all determinations

of time the beginning of some and the ceasing to be of other substances

would utterly do away with the only condition of the empirical unity of time

and in that case phenomena would relate to two different times in which side

by side existence would pass which is absurd for there is only one time in

which all different times must be placed not as coexistent but as successive




accordingly permanence is a necessary condition under which alone phenomena

as things or objects are determinable in a possible experience but as regards

the empirical criterion of this necessary permanence and with it of the

substantiality of phenomena we shall find sufficient opportunity to speak in

the sequel




b second analogy




principle of the succession of time according to the law of causality all

changes take place according to the law of the connection of cause and effect




proof




that all phenomena in the succession of time are only changes that is a

successive being and nonbeing of the determinations of substance which is

permanent consequently that a being of substance itself which follows on the

nonbeing thereof or a nonbeing of substance which follows on the being

thereof in other words that the origin or extinction of substance itself is

impossibleall this has been fully established in treating of the

foregoing principle this principle might have been expressed as follows

all alteration succession of phenomena is merely change for

the changes of substance are not origin or extinction because the conception

of change presupposes the same subject as existing with two opposite

determinations and consequently as permanent after this premonition we shall

proceed to the proof




i perceive that phenomena succeed one another that is to say a state of

things exists at one time the opposite of which existed in a former state in

this case then i really connect together two perceptions in time now

connection is not an operation of mere sense and intuition but is the product

of a synthetical faculty of imagination which determines the internal sense in

respect of a relation of time but imagination can connect these two states in

two ways so that either the one or the other may antecede in time for time in

itself cannot be an object of perception and what in an object precedes and

what follows cannot be empirically determined in relation to it i am only

conscious then that my imagination places one state before and the other

after not that the one state antecedes the other in the object in other

words the objective relation of the successive phenomena remains quite

undetermined by means of mere perception now in order that this relation may

be cognized as determined the relation between the two states must be so

cogitated that it is thereby determined as necessary which of them must be

placed before and which after and not conversely but the conception which

carries with it a necessity of synthetical unity can be none other than a pure

conception of the understanding which does not lie in mere perception and in

this case it is the conception of the relation of cause and

effect the former of which determines the latter in time as its

necessary consequence and not as something which might possibly antecede or

which might in some cases not be perceived to follow it follows that it is

only because we subject the sequence of phenomena and consequently all change

to the law of causality that experience itself that is empirical cognition

of phenomena becomes possible and consequently that phenomena themselves as

objects of experience are possible only by virtue of this law




our apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive the

representations of parts succeed one another whether they succeed one another

in the object also is a second point for reflection which was not contained

in the former now we may certainly give the name of object to everything even

to every representation so far as we are conscious thereof but what this word

may mean in the case of phenomena not merely in so far as they as

representations are objects but only in so far as they indicate an object is

a question requiring deeper consideration in so far as they regarded merely

as representations are at the same time objects of consciousness they are not

to be distinguished from apprehension that is reception into the synthesis of

imagination and we must therefore say the manifold of phenomena is

always produced successively in the mind if phenomena were things in

themselves no man would be able to conjecture from the succession of our

representations how this manifold is connected in the object for we have to do

only with our representations how things may be in themselves without regard

to the representations through which they affect us is utterly beyond the

sphere of our cognition now although phenomena are not things in themselves

and are nevertheless the only thing given to us to be cognized it is my duty

to show what sort of connection in time belongs to the manifold in phenomena

themselves while the representation of this manifold in apprehension is always

successive for example the apprehension of the manifold in the phenomenon of

a house which stands before me is successive now comes the question whether

the manifold of this house is in itself successivewhich no one will be

at all willing to grant but so soon as i raise my conception of an object to

the transcendental signification thereof i find that the house is not a thing

in itself but only a phenomenon that is a representation the transcendental

object of which remains utterly unknown what then am i to understand by the

question how can the manifold be connected in the phenomenon

itselfnot considered as a thing in itself but merely as a

phenomenon here that which lies in my successive apprehension is

regarded as representation whilst the phenomenon which is given me

notwithstanding that it is nothing more than a complex of these

representations is regarded as the object thereof with which my conception

drawn from the representations of apprehension must harmonize it is very soon

seen that as accordance of the cognition with its object constitutes truth

the question now before us can only relate to the formal conditions of

empirical truth and that the phenomenon in opposition to the representations

of apprehension can only be distinguished therefrom as the object of them if

it is subject to a rule which distinguishes it from every other apprehension

and which renders necessary a mode of connection of the manifold that in the

phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule of apprehension

is the object




let us now proceed to our task that something happens that is to say that

something or some state exists which before was not cannot be empirically

perceived unless a phenomenon precedes which does not contain in itself this

state for a reality which should follow upon a void time in other words a

beginning which no state of things precedes can just as little be apprehended

as the void time itself every apprehension of an event is therefore a

perception which follows upon another perception but as this is the case with

all synthesis of apprehension as i have shown above in the example of a house

my apprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished from other

apprehensions but i remark also that if in a phenomenon which contains an

occurrence i call the antecedent state of my perception a and the following

state b the perception b can only follow a in apprehension and the

perception a cannot follow b but only precede it for example i see a ship

float down the stream of a river my perception of its place lower down follows

upon my perception of its place higher up the course of the river and it is

impossible that in the apprehension of this phenomenon the vessel should be

perceived first below and afterwards higher up the stream here therefore the

order in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined and by this

order apprehension is regulated in the former example my perceptions in the

apprehension of a house might begin at the roof and end at the foundation or

vice versa or i might apprehend the manifold in this empirical intuition by

going from left to right and from right to left accordingly in the series of

these perceptions there was no determined order which necessitated my

beginning at a certain point in order empirically to connect the manifold but

this rule is always to be met with in the perception of that which happens and

it makes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of such a

phenomenon necessary




i must therefore in the present case deduce the subjective sequence of

apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena for otherwise the former

is quite undetermined and one phenomenon is not distinguishable from another

the former alone proves nothing as to the connection of the manifold in an

object for it is quite arbitrary the latter must consist in the order of the

manifold in a phenomenon according to which order the apprehension of one

thing that which happens follows that of another thing which precedes in

conformity with a rule in this way alone can i be authorized to say of the

phenomenon itself and not merely of my own apprehension that a certain order

or sequence is to be found therein that is in other words i cannot arrange

my apprehension otherwise than in this order




in conformity with this rule then it is necessary that in that which

antecedes an event there be found the condition of a rule according to which

in this event follows always and necessarily but i cannot reverse this and go

back from the event and determine by apprehension that which antecedes it

for no phenomenon goes back from the succeeding point of time to the preceding

point although it does certainly relate to a preceding point of time from a

given time on the other hand there is always a necessary progression to the

determined succeeding time therefore because there certainly is something

that follows i must of necessity connect it with something else which

antecedes and upon which it follows in conformity with a rule that is

necessarily so that the event as conditioned affords certain indication of a

condition and this condition determines the event




let us suppose that nothing precedes an event upon which this event must

follow in conformity with a rule all sequence of perception would then exist

only in apprehension that is to say would be merely subjective and it could

not thereby be objectively determined what thing ought to precede and what

ought to follow in perception in such a case we should have nothing but a

play of representations which would possess no application to any object that

is to say it would not be possible through perception to distinguish one

phenomenon from another as regards relations of time because the succession

in the act of apprehension would always be of the same sort and therefore

there would be nothing in the phenomenon to determine the succession and to

render a certain sequence objectively necessary and in this case i cannot

say that two states in a phenomenon follow one upon the other but only that

one apprehension follows upon another but this is merely subjective and does

not determine an object and consequently cannot be held to be cognition of an

objectnot even in the phenomenal world




accordingly when we know in experience that something happens we always

presuppose that something precedes whereupon it follows in conformity with a

rule for otherwise i could not say of the object that it follows because the

mere succession in my apprehension if it be not determined by a rule in

relation to something preceding does not authorize succession in the object

only therefore in reference to a rule according to which phenomena are

determined in their sequence that is as they happen by the preceding state

can i make my subjective synthesis of apprehension objective and it is only

under this presupposition that even the experience of an event is possible




no doubt it appears as if this were in thorough contradiction to all the

notions which people have hitherto entertained in regard to the procedure of

the human understanding according to these opinions it is by means of the

perception and comparison of similar consequences following upon certain

antecedent phenomena that the understanding is led to the discovery of a rule

according to which certain events always follow certain phenomena and it is

only by this process that we attain to the conception of cause upon such a

basis it is clear that this conception must be merely empirical and the rule

which it furnishes us witheverything that happens must have a

causewould be just as contingent as experience itself the

universality and necessity of the rule or law would be perfectly spurious

attributes of it indeed it could not possess universal validity inasmuch as

it would not in this case be  priori but founded on deduction but the same

is the case with this law as with other pure  priori representations eg

space and time which we can draw in perfect clearness and completeness from

experience only because we had already placed them therein and by that means

and by that alone had rendered experience possible indeed the logical

clearness of this representation of a rule determining the series of events

is possible only when we have made use thereof in experience nevertheless the

recognition of this rule as a condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena

in time was the ground of experience itself and consequently preceded it 

priori




it is now our duty to show by an example that we never even in experience

attribute to an object the notion of succession or effect of an

eventthat is the happening of something that did not exist before and

distinguish it from the subjective succession of apprehension unless when a

rule lies at the foundation which compels us to observe this order of

perception in preference to any other and that indeed it is this necessity

which first renders possible the representation of a succession in the object




we have representations within us of which also we can be conscious but

however widely extended however accurate and thoroughgoing this consciousness

may be these representations are still nothing more than representations that

is internal determinations of the mind in this or that relation of time now

how happens it that to these representations we should set an object or that

in addition to their subjective reality as modifications we should still

further attribute to them a certain unknown objective reality it is clear that

objective significancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation

of that which we desire to term object for in that case the question again

arises how does this other representation go out of itself and obtain

objective significancy over and above the subjective which is proper to it as

a determination of a state of mind if we try to discover what sort of

new property the relation to an object gives to our subjective representations

and what new importance they thereby receive we shall find that this relation

has no other effect than that of rendering necessary the connection of our

representations in a certain manner and of subjecting them to a rule and that

conversely it is only because a certain order is necessary in the relations of

time of our representations that objective significancy is ascribed to them




in the synthesis of phenomena the manifold of our representations is always

successive now hereby is not represented an object for by means of this

succession which is common to all apprehension no one thing is distinguished

from another but so soon as i perceive or assume that in this succession there

is a relation to a state antecedent from which the representation follows in

accordance with a rule so soon do i represent something as an event or as a

thing that happens in other words i cognize an object to which i must assign

a certain determinate position in time which cannot be altered because of the

preceding state in the object when therefore i perceive that something

happens there is contained in this representation in the first place the

fact that something antecedes because it is only in relation to this that

the phenomenon obtains its proper relation of time in other words exists

after an antecedent time in which it did not exist but it can receive its

determined place in time only by the presupposition that something existed in

the foregoing state upon which it follows inevitably and always that is in

conformity with a rule from all this it is evident that in the first place i

cannot reverse the order of succession and make that which happens precede

that upon which it follows and that in the second place if the antecedent

state be posited a certain determinate event inevitably and necessarily

follows hence it follows that there exists a certain order in our

representations whereby the present gives a sure indication of some previously

existing state as a correlate though still undetermined of the existing

event which is givena correlate which itself relates to the event as its

consequence conditions it and connects it necessarily with itself in the

series of time




if then it be admitted as a necessary law of sensibility and consequently a

formal condition of all perception that the preceding necessarily determines

the succeeding time inasmuch as i cannot arrive at the succeeding except

through the preceding it must likewise be an indispensable law of empirical

representation of the series of time that the phenomena of the past determine

all phenomena in the succeeding time and that the latter as events cannot

take place except in so far as the former determine their existence in time

that is to say establish it according to a rule for it is of course only in

phenomena that we can empirically cognize this continuity in the connection of

times




for all experience and for the possibility of experience understanding is

indispensable and the first step which it takes in this sphere is not to

render the representation of objects clear but to render the representation of

an object in general possible it does this by applying the order of time to

phenomena and their existence in other words it assigns to each phenomenon

as a consequence a place in relation to preceding phenomena determined 

priori in time without which it could not harmonize with time itself which

determines a place  priori to all its parts this determination of place

cannot be derived from the relation of phenomena to absolute time for it is

not an object of perception but on the contrary phenomena must reciprocally

determine the places in time of one another and render these necessary in the

order of time in other words whatever follows or happens must follow in

conformity with a universal rule upon that which was contained in the foregoing

state hence arises a series of phenomena which by means of the

understanding produces and renders necessary exactly the same order and

continuous connection in the series of our possible perceptions as is found 

priori in the form of internal intuition time in which all our perceptions

must have place




that something happens then is a perception which belongs to a possible

experience which becomes real only because i look upon the phenomenon as

determined in regard to its place in time consequently as an object which can

always be found by means of a rule in the connected series of my perceptions

but this rule of the determination of a thing according to succession in time

is as follows in what precedes may be found the condition under which

an event always that is necessarily follows from all this it is

obvious that the principle of cause and effect is the principle of possible

experience that is of objective cognition of phenomena in regard to their

relations in the succession of time




the proof of this fundamental proposition rests entirely on the following

momenta of argument to all empirical cognition belongs the synthesis of the

manifold by the imagination a synthesis which is always successive that is

in which the representations therein always follow one another but the order

of succession in imagination is not determined and the series of successive

representations may be taken retrogressively as well as progressively but if

this synthesis is a synthesis of apprehension of the manifold of a given

phenomenon then the order is determined in the object or to speak more

accurately there is therein an order of successive synthesis which determines

an object and according to which something necessarily precedes and when this

is posited something else necessarily follows if then my perception is to

contain the cognition of an event that is of something which really happens

it must be an empirical judgement wherein we think that the succession is

determined that is it presupposes another phenomenon upon which this event

follows necessarily or in conformity with a rule if on the contrary when i

posited the antecedent the event did not necessarily follow i should be

obliged to consider it merely as a subjective play of my imagination and if in

this i represented to myself anything as objective i must look upon it as a

mere dream thus the relation of phenomena as possible perceptions

according to which that which happens is as to its existence necessarily

determined in time by something which antecedes in conformity with a

rulein other words the relation of cause and effectis the

condition of the objective validity of our empirical judgements in regard to

the sequence of perceptions consequently of their empirical truth and

therefore of experience the principle of the relation of causality in the

succession of phenomena is therefore valid for all objects of experience

because it is itself the ground of the possibility of experience




here however a difficulty arises which must be resolved the principle of

the connection of causality among phenomena is limited in our formula to the

succession thereof although in practice we find that the principle applies

also when the phenomena exist together in the same time and that cause and

effect may be simultaneous for example there is heat in a room which does

not exist in the open air i look about for the cause and find it to be the

fire now the fire as the cause is simultaneous with its effect the heat of

the room in this case then there is no succession as regards time between

cause and effect but they are simultaneous and still the law holds good the

greater part of operating causes in nature are simultaneous with their effects

and the succession in time of the latter is produced only because the cause

cannot achieve the total of its effect in one moment but at the moment when

the effect first arises it is always simultaneous with the causality of its

cause because if the cause had but a moment before ceased to be the effect

could not have arisen here it must be specially remembered that we must

consider the order of time and not the lapse thereof the relation remains

even though no time has elapsed the time between the causality of the cause

and its immediate effect may entirely vanish and the cause and effect be thus

simultaneous but the relation of the one to the other remains always

determinable according to time if for example i consider a leaden ball

which lies upon a cushion and makes a hollow in it as a cause then it is

simultaneous with the effect but i distinguish the two through the relation of

time of the dynamical connection of both for if i lay the ball upon the

cushion then the hollow follows upon the before smooth surface but supposing

the cushion has from some cause or another a hollow there does not thereupon

follow a leaden ball




thus the law of succession of time is in all instances the only empirical

criterion of effect in relation to the causality of the antecedent cause the

glass is the cause of the rising of the water above its horizontal surface

although the two phenomena are contemporaneous for as soon as i draw some

water with the glass from a larger vessel an effect follows thereupon namely

the change of the horizontal state which the water had in the large vessel into

a concave which it assumes in the glass




this conception of causality leads us to the conception of action that of

action to the conception of force and through it to the conception of

substance as i do not wish this critical essay the sole purpose of which is

to treat of the sources of our synthetical cognition  priori to be crowded

with analyses which merely explain but do not enlarge the sphere of our

conceptions i reserve the detailed explanation of the above conceptions for a

future system of pure reason such an analysis indeed executed with great

particularity may already be found in wellknown works on this subject but i

cannot at present refrain from making a few remarks on the empirical criterion

of a substance in so far as it seems to be more evident and more easily

recognized through the conception of action than through that of the permanence

of a phenomenon




where action consequently activity and force exists substance also must

exist and in it alone must be sought the seat of that fruitful source of

phenomena very well but if we are called upon to explain what we mean by

substance and wish to avoid the vice of reasoning in a circle the answer is

by no means so easy how shall we conclude immediately from the action to the

permanence of that which acts this being nevertheless an essential and

peculiar criterion of substance phenomenon but after what has been said

above the solution of this question becomes easy enough although by the

common mode of proceduremerely analysing our conceptionsit would

be quite impossible the conception of action indicates the relation of the

subject of causality to the effect now because all effect consists in that

which happens therefore in the changeable the last subject thereof is the

permanent as the substratum of all that changes that is substance for

according to the principle of causality actions are always the first ground of

all change in phenomena and consequently cannot be a property of a subject

which itself changes because if this were the case other actions and another

subject would be necessary to determine this change from all this it results

that action alone as an empirical criterion is a sufficient proof of the

presence of substantiality without any necessity on my part of endeavouring to

discover the permanence of substance by a comparison besides by this mode of

induction we could not attain to the completeness which the magnitude and

strict universality of the conception requires for that the primary subject of

the causality of all arising and passing away all origin and extinction

cannot itself in the sphere of phenomena arise and pass away is a sound and

safe conclusion a conclusion which leads us to the conception of empirical

necessity and permanence in existence and consequently to the conception of a

substance as phenomenon




when something happens the mere fact of the occurrence without regard to that

which occurs is an object requiring investigation the transition from the

nonbeing of a state into the existence of it supposing that this state

contains no quality which previously existed in the phenomenon is a fact of

itself demanding inquiry such an event as has been shown in no a does not

concern substance for substance does not thus originate but its condition or

state it is therefore only change and not origin from nothing if this origin

be regarded as the effect of a foreign cause it is termed creation which

cannot be admitted as an event among phenomena because the very possibility of

it would annihilate the unity of experience if however i regard all things

not as phenomena but as things in themselves and objects of understanding

alone they although substances may be considered as dependent in respect of

their existence on a foreign cause but this would require a very different

meaning in the words a meaning which could not apply to phenomena as objects

of possible experience




how a thing can be changed how it is possible that upon one state existing in

one point of time an opposite state should follow in another point of

timeof this we have not the smallest conception  priori there is

requisite for this the knowledge of real powers which can only be given

empirically for example knowledge of moving forces or in other words of

certain successive phenomena as movements which indicate the presence of such

forces but the form of every change the condition under which alone it can

take place as the coming into existence of another state be the content of the

change that is the state which is changed what it may and consequently the

succession of the states themselves can very well be considered  priori in

relation to the law of causality and the conditions of time32


 32

it must be remarked that i do not speak of the change of certain relations but

of the change of the state thus when a body moves in a uniform manner it

does not change its state of motion but only when all motion increases or

decreases




when a substance passes from one state a into another state b the point of

time in which the latter exists is different from and subsequent to that in

which the former existed in like manner the second state as reality in the

phenomenon differs from the first in which the reality of the second did not

exist as b from zero that is to say if the state b differs from the state

a only in respect to quantity the change is a coming into existence of b a

which in the former state did not exist and in relation to which that state is

 o




now the question arises how a thing passes from one state  a into another

state  b between two moments there is always a certain time and between two

states existing in these moments there is always a difference having a certain

quantity for all parts of phenomena are in their turn quantities

consequently every transition from one state into another is always effected

in a time contained between two moments of which the first determines the

state which leaves and the second determines the state into the thing passes

the thing leaves and the second determines the state into which the thing both

moments then are limitations of the time of a change consequently of the

intermediate state between both and as such they belong to the total of the

change now every change has a cause which evidences its causality in the

whole time during which the charge takes place the cause therefore does not

produce the change all at once or in one moment but in a time so that as the

time gradually increases from the commencing instant a to its completion at

b in like manner also the quantity of the reality b  a is generated

through the lesser degrees which are contained between the first and last all

change is therefore possible only through a continuous action of the causality

which in so far as it is uniform we call a momentum the change does not

consist of these momenta but is generated or produced by them as their effect




such is the law of the continuity of all change the ground of which is that

neither time itself nor any phenomenon in time consists of parts which are the

smallest possible but that notwithstanding the state of a thing passes in

the process of a change through all these parts as elements to its second

state there is no smallest degree of reality in a phenomenon just as there is

no smallest degree in the quantity of time and so the new state of reality

grows up out of the former state through all the infinite degrees thereof the

differences of which one from another taken all together are less than the

difference between o and a




it is not our business to inquire here into the utility of this principle in

the investigation of nature but how such a proposition which appears so

greatly to extend our knowledge of nature is possible completely  priori is

indeed a question which deserves investigation although the first view seems

to demonstrate the truth and reality of the principle and the question how it

is possible may be considered superfluous for there are so many groundless

pretensions to the enlargement of our knowledge by pure reason that we must

take it as a general rule to be mistrustful of all such and without a

thoroughgoing and radical deduction to believe nothing of the sort even on the

clearest dogmatical evidence




every addition to our empirical knowledge and every advance made in the

exercise of our perception is nothing more than an extension of the

determination of the internal sense that is to say a progression in time be

objects themselves what they may phenomena or pure intuitions this

progression in time determines everything and is itself determined by nothing

else that is to say the parts of the progression exist only in time and by

means of the synthesis thereof and are not given antecedently to it for this

reason every transition in perception to anything which follows upon another

in time is a determination of time by means of the production of this

perception and as this determination of time is always and in all its parts

a quantity the perception produced is to be considered as a quantity which

proceeds through all its degreesno one of which is the smallest

possiblefrom zero up to its determined degree from this we perceive the

possibility of cognizing  priori a law of changesa law however which

concerns their form merely we merely anticipate our own apprehension the

formal condition of which inasmuch as it is itself to be found in the mind

antecedently to all given phenomena must certainly be capable of being

cognized  priori




thus as time contains the sensuous condition  priori of the possibility of a

continuous progression of that which exists to that which follows it the

understanding by virtue of the unity of apperception contains the condition 

priori of the possibility of a continuous determination of the position in time

of all phenomena and this by means of the series of causes and effects the

former of which necessitate the sequence of the latter and thereby render

universally and for all time and by consequence objectively valid the

empirical cognition of the relations of time




c third analogy




principle of coexistence according to the law of reciprocity or community




all substances in so far as they can be perceived in space at the same time

exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action




proof




things are coexistent when in empirical intuition the perception of the one

can follow upon the perception of the other and vice versawhich cannot

occur in the succession of phenomena as we have shown in the explanation of

the second principle thus i can perceive the moon and then the earth or

conversely first the earth and then the moon and for the reason that my

perceptions of these objects can reciprocally follow each other i say they

exist contemporaneously now coexistence is the existence of the manifold in

the same time but time itself is not an object of perception and therefore we

cannot conclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time the

other fact that the perception of these things can follow each other

reciprocally the synthesis of the imagination in apprehension would only

present to us each of these perceptions as present in the subject when the

other is not present and contrariwise but would not show that the objects are

coexistent that is to say that if the one exists the other also exists in

the same time and that this is necessarily so in order that the perceptions

may be capable of following each other reciprocally it follows that a

conception of the understanding or category of the reciprocal sequence of the

determinations of phenomena existing as they do apart from each other and

yet contemporaneously is requisite to justify us in saying that the

reciprocal succession of perceptions has its foundation in the object and to

enable us to represent coexistence as objective but that relation of

substances in which the one contains determinations the ground of which is in

the other substance is the relation of influence and when this influence is

reciprocal it is the relation of community or reciprocity consequently the

coexistence of substances in space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise

than under the precondition of their reciprocal action this is therefore the

condition of the possibility of things themselves as objects of experience




things are coexistent in so far as they exist in one and the same time but

how can we know that they exist in one and the same time only by observing

that the order in the synthesis of apprehension of the manifold is arbitrary

and a matter of indifference that is to say that it can proceed from a

through b c d to e or contrariwise from e to a for if they were successive

in time and in the order let us suppose which begins with a it is quite

impossible for the apprehension in perception to begin with e and go backwards

to a inasmuch as a belongs to past time and therefore cannot be an object of

apprehension




let us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomena each is

completely isolated that is that no one acts upon another then i say that

the coexistence of these cannot be an object of possible perception and that

the existence of one cannot by any mode of empirical synthesis lead us to the

existence of another for we imagine them in this case to be separated by a

completely void space and thus perception which proceeds from the one to the

other in time would indeed determine their existence by means of a following

perception but would be quite unable to distinguish whether the one phenomenon

follows objectively upon the first or is coexistent with it




besides the mere fact of existence then there must be something by means of

which a determines the position of b in time and conversely b the position of

a because only under this condition can substances be empirically represented

as existing contemporaneously now that alone determines the position of

another thing in time which is the cause of it or of its determinations

consequently every substance inasmuch as it can have succession predicated of

it only in respect of its determinations must contain the causality of certain

determinations in another substance and at the same time the effects of the

causality of the other in itself that is to say substances must stand

mediately or immediately in dynamical community with each other if

coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience but in regard to

objects of experience that is absolutely necessary without which the

experience of these objects would itself be impossible consequently it is

absolutely necessary that all substances in the world of phenomena in so far

as they are coexistent stand in a relation of complete community of reciprocal

action to each other




the word community has in our language33 two meanings and

contains the two notions conveyed in the latin communio and commercium we

employ it in this place in the latter sensethat of a dynamical

community without which even the community of place communio spatii could

not be empirically cognized in our experiences it is easy to observe that it

is only the continuous influences in all parts of space that can conduct our

senses from one object to another that the light which plays between our eyes

and the heavenly bodies produces a mediating community between them and us and

thereby evidences their coexistence with us that we cannot empirically change

our position perceive this change unless the existence of matter throughout

the whole of space rendered possible the perception of the positions we occupy

and that this perception can prove the contemporaneous existence of these

places only through their reciprocal influence and thereby also the

coexistence of even the most remote objectsalthough in this case the

proof is only mediate without community every perception of a phenomenon in

space is separated from every other and isolated and the chain of empirical

representations that is of experience must with the appearance of a new

object begin entirely de novo without the least connection with preceding

representations and without standing towards these even in the relation of

time my intention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space for

it may exist where our perceptions cannot exist inasmuch as they cannot reach

thereto and where therefore no empirical perception of coexistence takes

place but in this case it is not an object of possible experience

the following remarks may be useful in the way of explanation in the mind all

phenomena as contents of a possible experience must exist in community

communio of apperception or consciousness and in so far as it is requisite

that objects be represented as coexistent and connected in so far must they

reciprocally determine the position in time of each other and thereby

constitute a whole if this subjective community is to rest upon an objective

basis or to be applied to substances as phenomena the perception of one

substance must render possible the perception of another and conversely for

otherwise succession which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions

would be predicated of external objects and their representation of their

coexistence be thus impossible but this is a reciprocal influence that is to

say a real community commercium of substances without which therefore the

empirical relation of coexistence would be a notion beyond the reach of our

minds by virtue of this commercium phenomena in so far as they are apart

from and nevertheless in connection with each other constitute a compositum

reale such composita are possible in many different ways the three dynamical

relations then from which all others spring are those of inherence

consequence and composition




these then are the three analogies of experience they are nothing more than

principles of the determination of the existence of phenomena in time

according to the three modi of this determination to wit the relation to time

itself as a quantity the quantity of existence that is duration the

relation in time as a series or succession finally the relation in time as

the complex of all existence simultaneity this unity of determination in

regard to time is thoroughly dynamical that is to say time is not considered

as that in which experience determines immediately to every existence its

position for this is impossible inasmuch as absolute time is not an object of

perception by means of which phenomena can be connected with each other on

the contrary the rule of the understanding through which alone the existence

of phenomena can receive synthetical unity as regards relations of time

determines for every phenomenon its position in time and consequently 

priori and with validity for all and every time




by nature in the empirical sense of the word we understand the totality of

phenomena connected in respect of their existence according to necessary

rules that is laws there are therefore certain laws which are moreover 

priori which make nature possible and all empirical laws can exist only by

means of experience and by virtue of those primitive laws through which

experience itself becomes possible the purpose of the analogies is therefore

to represent to us the unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under

certain exponents the only business of which is to express the relation of

time in so far as it contains all existence in itself to the unity of

apperception which can exist in synthesis only according to rules the

combined expression of all is this all phenomena exist in one nature

and must so exist inasmuch as without this  priori unity no unity of

experience and consequently no determination of objects in experience is

possible




as regards the mode of proof which we have employed in treating of these

transcendental laws of nature and the peculiar character of we must make one

remark which will at the same time be important as a guide in every other

attempt to demonstrate the truth of intellectual and likewise synthetical

propositions  priori had we endeavoured to prove these analogies

dogmatically that is from conceptions that is to say had we employed this

method in attempting to show that everything which exists exists only in that

which is permanentthat every thing or event presupposes the existence of

something in a preceding state upon which it follows in conformity with a

rulelastly that in the manifold which is coexistent the states

coexist in connection with each other according to a rule all our labour would

have been utterly in vain for more conceptions of things analyse them as we

may cannot enable us to conclude from the existence of one object to the

existence of another what other course was left for us to pursue this only

to demonstrate the possibility of experience as a cognition in which at last

all objects must be capable of being presented to us if the representation of

them is to possess any objective reality now in this third this mediating

term the essential form of which consists in the synthetical unity of the

apperception of all phenomena we found  priori conditions of the universal

and necessary determination as to time of all existences in the world of

phenomena without which the empirical determination thereof as to time would

itself be impossible and we also discovered rules of synthetical unity 

priori by means of which we could anticipate experience for want of this

method and from the fancy that it was possible to discover a dogmatical proof

of the synthetical propositions which are requisite in the empirical employment

of the understanding has it happened that a proof of the principle of

sufficient reason has been so often attempted and always in vain the other

two analogies nobody has ever thought of although they have always been

silently employed by the mind34 because the guiding thread furnished by

the categories was wanting the guide which alone can enable us to discover

every hiatus both in the system of conceptions and of principles



 34

the unity of the universe in which all phenomena to be connected is evidently

a mere consequence of the admitted principle of the community of all substances

which are coexistent for were substances isolated they could not as parts

constitute a whole and were their connection reciprocal action of the

manifold not necessary from the very fact of coexistence we could not

conclude from the fact of the latter as a merely ideal relation to the former

as a real one we have however shown in its place that community is the

proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of coexistence and

that we may therefore properly reason from the latter to the former as its

condition




4 the postulates of empirical thought




1 that which agrees with the formal conditions intuition and conception of

experience is possible




2 that which coheres with the material conditions of experience sensation

is real




3 that whose coherence with the real is determined according to universal

conditions of experience is exists necessary




explanation




the categories of modality possess this peculiarity that they do not in the

least determine the object or enlarge the conception to which they are annexed

as predicates but only express its relation to the faculty of cognition

though my conception of a thing is in itself complete i am still entitled to

ask whether the object of it is merely possible or whether it is also real

or if the latter whether it is also necessary but hereby the object itself

is not more definitely determined in thought but the question is only in what

relation it including all its determinations stands to the understanding and

its employment in experience to the empirical faculty of judgement and to the

reason of its application to experience




for this very reason too the categories of modality are nothing more than

explanations of the conceptions of possibility reality and necessity as

employed in experience and at the same time restrictions of all the

categories to empirical use alone not authorizing the transcendental

employment of them for if they are to have something more than a merely

logical significance and to be something more than a mere analytical

expression of the form of thought and to have a relation to things and their

possibility reality or necessity they must concern possible experience and

its synthetical unity in which alone objects of cognition can be given




the postulate of the possibility of things requires also that the conception

of the things agree with the formal conditions of our experience in general

but this that is to say the objective form of experience contains all the

kinds of synthesis which are requisite for the cognition of objects a

conception which contains a synthesis must be regarded as empty and without

reference to an object if its synthesis does not belong to

experienceeither as borrowed from it and in this case it is called an

empirical conception or such as is the ground and  priori condition of

experience its form and in this case it is a pure conception a conception

which nevertheless belongs to experience inasmuch as its object can be found

in this alone for where shall we find the criterion or character of the

possibility of an object which is cogitated by means of an  priori synthetical

conception if not in the synthesis which constitutes the form of empirical

cognition of objects that in such a conception no contradiction exists is

indeed a necessary logical condition but very far from being sufficient to

establish the objective reality of the conception that is the possibility of

such an object as is thought in the conception thus in the conception of a

figure which is contained within two straight lines there is no contradiction

for the conceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain no

negation of a figure the impossibility in such a case does not rest upon the

conception in itself but upon the construction of it in space that is to say

upon the conditions of space and its determinations but these have themselves

objective reality that is they apply to possible things because they contain

 priori the form of experience in general




and now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility and influence of

this postulate of possibility when i represent to myself a thing that is

permanent so that everything in it which changes belongs merely to its state

or condition from such a conception alone i never can cognize that such a

thing is possible or if i represent to myself something which is so

constituted that when it is posited something else follows always and

infallibly my thought contains no selfcontradiction but whether such a

property as causality is to be found in any possible thing my thought alone

affords no means of judging finally i can represent to myself different

things substances which are so constituted that the state or condition of one

causes a change in the state of the other and reciprocally but whether such a

relation is a property of things cannot be perceived from these conceptions

which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis only from the fact therefore that

these conceptions express  priori the relations of perceptions in every

experience do we know that they possess objective reality that is

transcendental truth and that independent of experience though not

independent of all relation to form of an experience in general and its

synthetical unity in which alone objects can be empirically cognized




but when we fashion to ourselves new conceptions of substances forces action

and reaction from the material presented to us by perception without

following the example of experience in their connection we create mere

chimeras of the possibility of which we cannot discover any criterion because

we have not taken experience for our instructress though we have borrowed the

conceptions from her such fictitious conceptions derive their character of

possibility not like the categories  priori as conceptions on which all

experience depends but only  posteriori as conceptions given by means of

experience itself and their possibility must either be cognized  posteriori

and empirically or it cannot be cognized at all a substance which is

permanently present in space yet without filling it like that tertium quid

between matter and the thinking subject which some have tried to introduce into

metaphysics or a peculiar fundamental power of the mind of intuiting the

future by anticipation instead of merely inferring from past and present

events or finally a power of the mind to place itself in community of

thought with other men however distant they may bethese are conceptions

the possibility of which has no ground to rest upon for they are not based

upon experience and its known laws and without experience they are a merely

arbitrary conjunction of thoughts which though containing no internal

contradiction has no claim to objective reality neither consequently to the

possibility of such an object as is thought in these conceptions as far as

concerns reality it is selfevident that we cannot cogitate such a possibility

in concreto without the aid of experience because reality is concerned only

with sensation as the matter of experience and not with the form of thought

with which we can no doubt indulge in shaping fancies




but i pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality in

experience and i purpose treating here merely of the possibility of things by

means of  priori conceptions i maintain then that the possibility of things

is not derived from such conceptions per se but only when considered as formal

and objective conditions of an experience in general




it seems indeed as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognized from

the conception of it alone which is certainly independent of experience for

we can certainly give to the conception a corresponding object completely 

priori that is to say we can construct it but as a triangle is only the form

of an object it must remain a mere product of the imagination and the

possibility of the existence of an object corresponding to it must remain

doubtful unless we can discover some other ground unless we know that the

figure can be cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of

experience rest now the facts that space is a formal condition  priori of

external experience that the formative synthesis by which we construct a

triangle in imagination is the very same as that we employ in the apprehension

of a phenomenon for the purpose of making an empirical conception of it are

what alone connect the notion of the possibility of such a thing with the

conception of it in the same manner the possibility of continuous quantities

indeed of quantities in general for the conceptions of them are without

exception synthetical is never evident from the conceptions in themselves but

only when they are considered as the formal conditions of the determination of

objects in experience and where indeed should we look for objects to

correspond to our conceptions if not in experience by which alone objects are

presented to us it is however true that without antecedent experience we can

cognize and characterize the possibility of things relatively to the formal

conditions under which something is determined in experience as an object

consequently completely  priori but still this is possible only in relation

to experience and within its limits




the postulate concerning the cognition of the reality of things requires

perception consequently conscious sensation not indeed immediately that is

of the object itself whose existence is to be cognized but still that the

object have some connection with a real perception in accordance with the

analogies of experience which exhibit all kinds of real connection in

experience




from the mere conception of a thing it is impossible to conclude its existence

for let the conception be ever so complete and containing a statement of all

the determinations of the thing the existence of it has nothing to do with all

this but only with thew question whether such a thing is given so that the

perception of it can in every case precede the conception for the fact that

the conception of it precedes the perception merely indicates the possibility

of its existence it is perception which presents matter to the conception

that is the sole criterion of reality prior to the perception of the thing

however and therefore comparatively  priori we are able to cognize its

existence provided it stands in connection with some perceptions according to

the principles of the empirical conjunction of these that is in conformity

with the analogies of perception for in this case the existence of the

supposed thing is connected with our perception in a possible experience and

we are able with the guidance of these analogies to reason in the series of

possible perceptions from a thing which we do really perceive to the thing we

do not perceive thus we cognize the existence of a magnetic matter

penetrating all bodies from the perception of the attraction of the

steelfilings by the magnet although the constitution of our organs renders an

immediate perception of this matter impossible for us for according to the

laws of sensibility and the connected context of our perceptions we should in

an experience come also on an immediate empirical intuition of this matter if

our senses were more acutebut this obtuseness has no influence upon and

cannot alter the form of possible experience in general our knowledge of the

existence of things reaches as far as our perceptions and what may be inferred

from them according to empirical laws extend if we do not set out from

experience or do not proceed according to the laws of the empirical connection

of phenomena our pretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do

not immediately perceive are vain idealism however brings forward powerful

objections to these rules for proving existence mediately this is therefore

the proper place for its refutation




refutation of idealism




idealismi mean material idealismis the theory which declares the

existence of objects in space without us to be either  doubtful and

indemonstrable or 2 false and impossible the first is the problematical

idealism of descartes who admits the undoubted certainty of only one empirical

assertion assertio to wit i am the second is the dogmatical

idealism of berkeley who maintains that space together with all the objects

of which it is the inseparable condition is a thing which is in itself

impossible and that consequently the objects in space are mere products of the

imagination the dogmatical theory of idealism is unavoidable if we regard

space as a property of things in themselves for in that case it is with all

to which it serves as condition a nonentity but the foundation for this kind

of idealism we have already destroyed in the transcendental sthetic

problematical idealism which makes no such assertion but only alleges our

incapacity to prove the existence of anything besides ourselves by means of

immediate experience is a theory rational and evidencing a thorough and

philosophical mode of thinking for it observes the rule not to form a decisive

judgement before sufficient proof be shown the desired proof must therefore

demonstrate that we have experience of external things and not mere fancies

for this purpose we must prove that our internal and to descartes

indubitable experience is itself possible only under the previous assumption of

external experience




theorem




the simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence proves

the existence of external objects in space




proof




i am conscious of my own existence as determined in time all determination in

regard to time presupposes the existence of something permanent in perception

but this permanent something cannot be something in me for the very reason

that my existence in time is itself determined by this permanent something it

follows that the perception of this permanent existence is possible only

through a thing without me and not through the mere representation of a thing

without me consequently the determination of my existence in time is possible

only through the existence of real things external to me now consciousness in

time is necessarily connected with the consciousness of the possibility of this

determination in time hence it follows that consciousness in time is

necessarily connected also with the existence of things without me inasmuch as

the existence of these things is the condition of determination in time that

is to say the consciousness of my own existence is at the same time an

immediate consciousness of the existence of other things without me




remark i the reader will observe that in the foregoing proof the game which

idealism plays is retorted upon itself and with more justice it assumed that

the only immediate experience is internal and that from this we can only infer

the existence of external things but as always happens when we reason from

given effects to determined causes idealism has reasoned with too much haste

and uncertainty for it is quite possible that the cause of our representations

may lie in ourselves and that we ascribe it falsely to external things but

our proof shows that external experience is properly immediate35 that only by virtue of itnot

indeed the consciousness of our own existence but certainly the determination

of our existence in time that is internal experienceis possible it is

true that the representation i am which is the expression of

the consciousness which can accompany all my thoughts is that which

immediately includes the existence of a subject but in this representation we

cannot find any knowledge of the subject and therefore also no empirical

knowledge that is experience for experience contains in addition to the

thought of something existing intuition and in this case it must be internal

intuition that is time in relation to which the subject must be determined

but the existence of external things is absolutely requisite for this purpose

so that it follows that internal experience is itself possible only mediately

and through external experience



 35

the immediate consciousness of the existence of external things is in the

preceding theorem not presupposed but proved by the possibility of this

consciousness understood by us or not the question as to the possibility of it

would stand thus have we an internal sense but no external sense and

is our belief in external perception a mere delusion but it is evident

that in order merely to fancy to ourselves anything as external that is to

present it to the sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense

and must thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an external

intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act of imagination

for merely to imagine also an external sense would annihilate the faculty of

intuition itself which is to be determined by the imagination




remark ii now with this view all empirical use of our faculty of cognition in

the determination of time is in perfect accordance its truth is supported by

the fact that it is possible to perceive a determination of time only by means

of a change in external relations motion to the permanent in space for

example we become aware of the suns motion by observing the changes of

his relation to the objects of this earth but this is not all we find that

we possess nothing permanent that can correspond and be submitted to the

conception of a substance as intuition except matter this idea of permanence

is not itself derived from external experience but is an  priori necessary

condition of all determination of time consequently also of the internal sense

in reference to our own existence and that through the existence of external

things in the representation i the consciousness of myself is

not an intuition but a merely intellectual representation produced by the

spontaneous activity of a thinking subject it follows that this

i has not any predicate of intuition which in its character of

permanence could serve as correlate to the determination of time in the

internal sensein the same way as impenetrability is the correlate of

matter as an empirical intuition




remark iii from the fact that the existence of external things is a necessary

condition of the possibility of a determined consciousness of ourselves it

does not follow that every intuitive representation of external things involves

the existence of these things for their representations may very well be the

mere products of the imagination in dreams as well as in madness though

indeed these are themselves created by the reproduction of previous external

perceptions which as has been shown are possible only through the reality of

external objects the sole aim of our remarks has however been to prove that

internal experience in general is possible only through external experience in

general whether this or that supposed experience be purely imaginary must be

discovered from its particular determinations and by comparing these with the

criteria of all real experience




finally as regards the third postulate it applies to material necessity in

existence and not to merely formal and logical necessity in the connection of

conceptions now as we cannot cognize completely  priori the existence of any

object of sense though we can do so comparatively  priori that is

relatively to some other previously given existencea cognition however

which can only be of such an existence as must be contained in the complex of

experience of which the previously given perception is a partthe

necessity of existence can never be cognized from conceptions but always on

the contrary from its connection with that which is an object of perception

but the only existence cognized under the condition of other given phenomena

as necessary is the existence of effects from given causes in conformity with

the laws of causality it is consequently not the necessity of the existence of

things as substances but the necessity of the state of things that we

cognize and that not immediately but by means of the existence of other

states given in perception according to empirical laws of causality hence it

follows that the criterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of

possible experiencethat everything which happens is determined  priori

in the phenomenon by its cause thus we cognize only the necessity of effects

in nature the causes of which are given us moreover the criterion of

necessity in existence possesses no application beyond the field of possible

experience and even in this it is not valid of the existence of things as

substances because these can never be considered as empirical effects or as

something that happens and has a beginning necessity therefore regards only

the relations of phenomena according to the dynamical law of causality and the

possibility grounded thereon of reasoning from some given existence of a

cause  priori to another existence of an effect everything that

happens is hypothetically necessary is a principle which subjects the

changes that take place in the world to a law that is to a rule of necessary

existence without which nature herself could not possibly exist hence the

proposition nothing happens by blind chance in mundo non datur

casus is an  priori law of nature the case is the same with the

proposition necessity in nature is not blind that is it is

conditioned consequently intelligible necessity non datur fatum both laws

subject the play of change to a nature of things as phenomena

or which is the same thing to the unity of the understanding and through the

understanding alone can changes belong to an experience as the synthetical

unity of phenomena both belong to the class of dynamical principles the

former is properly a consequence of the principle of causalityone of the

analogies of experience the latter belongs to the principles of modality

which to the determination of causality adds the conception of necessity which

is itself however subject to a rule of the understanding the principle of

continuity forbids any leap in the series of phenomena regarded as changes in

mundo non datur saltus and likewise in the complex of all empirical

intuitions in space any break or hiatus between two phenomena non datur

hiatusfor we can so express the principle that experience can admit

nothing which proves the existence of a vacuum or which even admits it as a

part of an empirical synthesis for as regards a vacuum or void which we may

cogitate as out and beyond the field of possible experience the world such a

question cannot come before the tribunal of mere understanding which decides

only upon questions that concern the employment of given phenomena for the

construction of empirical cognition it is rather a problem for ideal reason

which passes beyond the sphere of a possible experience and aims at forming a

judgement of that which surrounds and circumscribes it and the proper place

for the consideration of it is the transcendental dialectic these four

propositions in mundo non datur hiatus non datur saltus non datur

casus non datur fatum as well as all principles of transcendental

origin we could very easily exhibit in their proper order that is in

conformity with the order of the categories and assign to each its proper

place but the already practised reader will do this for himself or discover

the clue to such an arrangement but the combined result of all is simply this

to admit into the empirical synthesis nothing which might cause a break in or

be foreign to the understanding and the continuous connection of all phenomena

that is the unity of the conceptions of the understanding for in the

understanding alone is the unity of experience in which all perceptions must

have their assigned place possible




whether the field of possibility be greater than that of reality and whether

the field of the latter be itself greater than that of necessity are

interesting enough questions and quite capable of synthetic solution

questions however which come under the jurisdiction of reason alone for they

are tantamount to asking whether all things as phenomena do without exception

belong to the complex and connected whole of a single experience of which

every given perception is a part which therefore cannot be conjoined with any

other phenomenaor whether my perceptions can belong to more than one

possible experience the understanding gives to experience according to the

subjective and formal conditions of sensibility as well as of apperception

the rules which alone make this experience possible other forms of intuition

besides those of space and time other forms of understanding besides the

discursive forms of thought or of cognition by means of conceptions we can

neither imagine nor make intelligible to ourselves and even if we could they

would still not belong to experience which is the only mode of cognition by

which objects are presented to us whether other perceptions besides those

which belong to the total of our possible experience and consequently whether

some other sphere of matter exists the understanding has no power to decide

its proper occupation being with the synthesis of that which is given

moreover the poverty of the usual arguments which go to prove the existence of

a vast sphere of possibility of which all that is real every object of

experience is but a small part is very remarkable all real is

possible from this follows naturally according to the logical laws of

conversion the particular proposition some possible is real

now this seems to be equivalent to much is possible that is not

real no doubt it does seem as if we ought to consider the sum of the

possible to be greater than that of the real from the fact that something must

be added to the former to constitute the latter but this notion of adding to

the possible is absurd for that which is not in the sum of the possible and

consequently requires to be added to it is manifestly impossible in addition

to accordance with the formal conditions of experience the understanding

requires a connection with some perception but that which is connected with

this perception is real even although it is not immediately perceived but

that another series of phenomena in complete coherence with that which is

given in perception consequently more than one allembracing experience is

possible is an inference which cannot be concluded from the data given us by

experience and still less without any data at all that which is possible only

under conditions which are themselves merely possible is not possible in any

respect and yet we can find no more certain ground on which to base the

discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility is wider than that

of experience




i have merely mentioned these questions that in treating of the conception of

the understanding there might be no omission of anything that in the common

opinion belongs to them in reality however the notion of absolute

possibility possibility which is valid in every respect is not a mere

conception of the understanding which can be employed empirically but belongs

to reason alone which passes the bounds of all empirical use of the

understanding we have therefore contented ourselves with a merely critical

remark leaving the subject to be explained in the sequel




before concluding this fourth section and at the same time the system of all

principles of the pure understanding it seems proper to mention the reasons

which induced me to term the principles of modality postulates this expression

i do not here use in the sense which some more recent philosophers contrary to

its meaning with mathematicians to whom the word properly belongs attach to

itthat of a proposition namely immediately certain requiring neither

deduction nor proof for if in the case of synthetical propositions however

evident they may be we accord to them without deduction and merely on the

strength of their own pretensions unqualified belief all critique of the

understanding is entirely lost and as there is no want of bold pretensions

which the common belief though for the philosopher this is no credential does

not reject the understanding lies exposed to every delusion and conceit

without the power of refusing its assent to those assertions which though

illegitimate demand acceptance as veritable axioms when therefore to the

conception of a thing an  priori determination is synthetically added such a

proposition must obtain if not a proof at least a deduction of the legitimacy

of its assertion




the principles of modality are however not objectively synthetical for the

predicates of possibility reality and necessity do not in the least augment

the conception of that of which they are affirmed inasmuch as they contribute

nothing to the representation of the object but as they are nevertheless

always synthetical they are so merely subjectively that is to say they have

a reflective power and apply to the conception of a thing of which in other

respects they affirm nothing the faculty of cognition in which the conception

originates and has its seat so that if the conception merely agree with the

formal conditions of experience its object is called possible if it is in

connection with perception and determined thereby the object is real if it

is determined according to conceptions by means of the connection of

perceptions the object is called necessary the principles of modality

therefore predicate of a conception nothing more than the procedure of the

faculty of cognition which generated it now a postulate in mathematics is a

practical proposition which contains nothing but the synthesis by which we

present an object to ourselves and produce the conception of it for

examplewith a given line to describe a circle upon a plane from

a given point and such a proposition does not admit of proof because

the procedure which it requires is exactly that by which alone it is possible

to generate the conception of such a figure with the same right accordingly

can we postulate the principles of modality because they do not augment36 the conception of a thing but merely

indicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty of cognition



 36

when i think the reality of a thing i do really think more than the

possibility but not in the thing for that can never contain more in reality

than was contained in its complete possibility but while the notion of

possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing in relation to the

understanding its empirical use reality is the conjunction of the thing with

perception




general remark on the system of principles




it is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of a thing from

the category alone but must always have an intuition by which to make evident

the objective reality of the pure conception of the understanding take for

example the categories of relation how 1 a thing can exist only as a

subject and not as a mere determination of other things that is can be

substance or how 2 because something exists some other thing must exist

consequently how a thing can be a cause or how 3 when several things exist

from the fact that one of these things exists some consequence to the others

follows and reciprocally and in this way a community of substances can be

possibleare questions whose solution cannot be obtained from mere

conceptions the very same is the case with the other categories for example

how a thing can be of the same sort with many others that is can be a

quantity and so on so long as we have not intuition we cannot know whether we

do really think an object by the categories and where an object can anywhere

be found to cohere with them and thus the truth is established that the

categories are not in themselves cognitions but mere forms of thought for the

construction of cognitions from given intuitions for the same reason is it

true that from categories alone no synthetical proposition can be made for

example in every existence there is substance that is

something that can exist only as a subject and not as mere predicate or

everything is a quantityto construct propositions such as

these we require something to enable us to go out beyond the given conception

and connect another with it for the same reason the attempt to prove a

synthetical proposition by means of mere conceptions for example

everything that exists contingently has a cause has never

succeeded we could never get further than proving that without this relation

to conceptions we could not conceive the existence of the contingent that is

could not  priori through the understanding cognize the existence of such a

thing but it does not hence follow that this is also the condition of the

possibility of the thing itself that is said to be contingent if accordingly

we look back to our proof of the principle of causality we shall find that we

were able to prove it as valid only of objects of possible experience and

indeed only as itself the principle of the possibility of experience

consequently of the cognition of an object given in empirical intuition and

not from mere conceptions that however the proposition everything

that is contingent must have a cause is evident to every one merely

from conceptions is not to be denied but in this case the conception of the

contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality as that the

nonexistence of which can be conceived but that of relation as that which

can exist only as the consequence of something else and so it is really an

identical proposition that which can exist only as a consequence has a

cause in fact when we have to give examples of contingent existence

we always refer to changes and not merely to the possibility of conceiving the

opposite37 but change is an event which as such

is possible only through a cause and considered per se its nonexistence is

therefore possible and we become cognizant of its contingency from the fact

that it can exist only as the effect of a cause hence if a thing is assumed

to be contingent it is an analytical proposition to say it has a cause



 37

we can easily conceive the nonexistence of matter but the ancients did not

thence infer its contingency but even the alternation of the existence and

nonexistence of a given state in a thing in which all change consists by no

means proves the contingency of that statethe ground of proof being the

reality of its opposite for example a body is in a state of rest after

motion but we cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that

the former is the opposite of the latter for this opposite is merely a logical

and not a real opposite to the other if we wish to demonstrate the contingency

of the motion what we ought to prove is that instead of the motion which took

place in the preceding point of time it was possible for the body to have been

then in rest not that it is afterwards in rest for in this case both

opposites are perfectly consistent with each other




but it is still more remarkable that to understand the possibility of things

according to the categories and thus to demonstrate the objective reality of

the latter we require not merely intuitions but external intuitions if for

example we take the pure conceptions of relation we find that 1 for the

purpose of presenting to the conception of substance something permanent in

intuition corresponding thereto and thus of demonstrating the objective reality

of this conception we require an intuition of matter in space because space

alone is permanent and determines things as such while time and with it all

that is in the internal sense is in a state of continual flow 2 in order to

represent change as the intuition corresponding to the conception of causality

we require the representation of motion as change in space in fact it is

through it alone that changes the possibility of which no pure understanding

can perceive are capable of being intuited change is the connection of

determinations contradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one

and the same thing now how it is possible that out of a given state one quite

opposite to it in the same thing should follow reason without an example can

not only not conceive but cannot even make intelligible without intuition and

this intuition is the motion of a point in space the existence of which in

different spaces as a consequence of opposite determinations alone makes the

intuition of change possible for in order to make even internal change

cognitable we require to represent time as the form of the internal sense

figuratively by a line and the internal change by the drawing of that line

motion and consequently are obliged to employ external intuition to be able

to represent the successive existence of ourselves in different states the

proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived as change

presupposes something permanent in intuition while in the internal sense no

permanent intuition is to be found lastly the objective possibility of the

category of community cannot be conceived by mere reason and consequently its

objective reality cannot be demonstrated without an intuition and that

external in space for how can we conceive the possibility of community that

is when several substances exist that some effect on the existence of the one

follows from the existence of the other and reciprocally and therefore that

because something exists in the latter something else must exist in the

former which could not be understood from its own existence alone for this is

the very essence of communitywhich is inconceivable as a property of

things which are perfectly isolated hence leibnitz in attributing to the

substances of the worldas cogitated by the understanding alonea

community required the mediating aid of a divinity for from their existence

such a property seemed to him with justice inconceivable but we can very

easily conceive the possibility of community of substances as phenomena if we

represent them to ourselves as in space consequently in external intuition

for external intuition contains in itself  priori formal external relations

as the conditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and

reaction and therefore of the possibility of community with the same ease can

it be demonstrated that the possibility of things as quantities and

consequently the objective reality of the category of quantity can be grounded

only in external intuition and that by its means alone is the notion of

quantity appropriated by the internal sense but i must avoid prolixity and

leave the task of illustrating this by examples to the readers own

reflection




the above remarks are of the greatest importance not only for the confirmation

of our previous confutation of idealism but still more when the subject of

selfcognition by mere internal consciousness and the determination of our own

nature without the aid of external empirical intuitions is under discussion

for the indication of the grounds of the possibility of such a cognition




the result of the whole of this part of the analytic of principles is

therefore all principles of the pure understanding are nothing more

than  priori principles of the possibility of experience and to experience

alone do all  priori synthetical propositions apply and relate indeed

their possibility itself rests entirely on this relation


chapter iii of the ground of the division of all

objects into phenomena and noumena


we have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding and

carefully surveyed every part of it but we have also measured it and assigned

to everything therein its proper place but this land is an island and

enclosed by nature herself within unchangeable limits it is the land of truth

an attractive word surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean the region of

illusion where many a fogbank many an iceberg seems to the mariner on his

voyage of discovery a new country and while constantly deluding him with

vain hopes engages him in dangerous adventures from which he never can

desist and which yet he never can bring to a termination but before venturing

upon this sea in order to explore it in its whole extent and to arrive at a

certainty whether anything is to be discovered there it will not be without

advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the land that we are about to

leave and to ask ourselves firstly whether we cannot rest perfectly

contented with what it contains or whether we must not of necessity be

contented with it if we can find nowhere else a solid foundation to build

upon and secondly by what title we possess this land itself and how we hold

it secure against all hostile claims although in the course of our analytic

we have already given sufficient answers to these questions yet a summary

recapitulation of these solutions may be useful in strengthening our

conviction by uniting in one point the momenta of the arguments




we have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself without

borrowing from experience it nevertheless possesses only for the behoof and

use of experience the principles of the pure understanding whether

constitutive  priori as the mathematical principles or merely regulative

as the dynamical contain nothing but the pure schema as it were of

possible experience for experience possesses its unity from the synthetical

unity which the understanding originally and from itself imparts to the

synthesis of the imagination in relation to apperception and in  priori

relation to and agreement with which phenomena as data for a possible

cognition must stand but although these rules of the understanding are not

only  priori true but the very source of all truth that is of the

accordance of our cognition with objects and on this ground that they contain

the basis of the possibility of experience as the ensemble of all cognition

it seems to us not enough to propound what is truewe desire also to be

told what we want to know if then we learn nothing more by this critical

examination than what we should have practised in the merely empirical use of

the understanding without any such subtle inquiry the presumption is that the

advantage we reap from it is not worth the labour bestowed upon it it may

certainly be answered that no rash curiosity is more prejudicial to the

enlargement of our knowledge than that which must know beforehand the utility

of this or that piece of information which we seek before we have entered on

the needful investigations and before one could form the least conception of

its utility even though it were placed before our eyes but there is one

advantage in such transcendental inquiries which can be made comprehensible to

the dullest and most reluctant learnerthis namely that the

understanding which is occupied merely with empirical exercise and does not

reflect on the sources of its own cognition may exercise its functions very

well and very successfully but is quite unable to do one thing and that of

very great importance to determine namely the bounds that limit its

employment and to know what lies within or without its own sphere this

purpose can be obtained only by such profound investigations as we have

instituted but if it cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within

its horizon or not it can never be sure either as to its claims or

possessions but must lay its account with many humiliating corrections when

it transgresses as it unavoidably will the limits of its own territory and

loses itself in fanciful opinions and blinding illusions




that the understanding therefore cannot make of its  priori principles or

even of its conceptions other than an empirical use is a proposition which

leads to the most important results a transcendental use is made of a

conception in a fundamental proposition or principle when it is referred to

things in general and considered as things in themselves an empirical use

when it is referred merely to phenomena that is to objects of a possible

experience that the latter use of a conception is the only admissible one is

evident from the reasons following for every conception are requisite

firstly the logical form of a conception of thought general and secondly

the possibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply failing

this latter it has no sense and utterly void of content although it may

contain the logical function for constructing a conception from certain data

now object cannot be given to a conception otherwise than by intuition and

even if a pure intuition antecedent to the object is  priori possible this

pure intuition can itself obtain objective validity only from empirical

intuition of which it is itself but the form all conceptions therefore and

with them all principles however high the degree of their  priori

possibility relate to empirical intuitions that is to data towards a

possible experience without this they possess no objective validity but are

mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or notions let us

take for example the conceptions of mathematics and first in its pure

intuitions space has three dimensionsbetween two

points there can be only one straight line etc although all these

principles and the representation of the object with which this science

occupies itself are generated in the mind entirely  priori they would

nevertheless have no significance if we were not always able to exhibit their

significance in and by means of phenomena empirical objects hence it is

requisite that an abstract conception be made sensuous that is that an object

corresponding to it in intuition be forthcoming otherwise the conception

remains as we say without sense that is without meaning mathematics

fulfils this requirement by the construction of the figure which is a

phenomenon evident to the senses the same science finds support and

significance in number this in its turn finds it in the fingers or in

counters or in lines and points the conception itself is always produced 

priori together with the synthetical principles or formulas from such

conceptions but the proper employment of them and their application to

objects can exist nowhere but in experience the possibility of which as

regards its form they contain  priori




that this is also the case with all of the categories and the principles based

upon them is evident from the fact that we cannot render intelligible the

possibility of an object corresponding to them without having recourse to the

conditions of sensibility consequently to the form of phenomena to which as

their only proper objects their use must therefore be confined inasmuch as

if this condition is removed all significance that is all relation to an

object disappears and no example can be found to make it comprehensible what

sort of things we ought to think under such conceptions




the conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that it is the

determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how many times one is

placed in it but this how many times is based upon successive

repetition consequently upon time and the synthesis of the homogeneous

therein reality in contradistinction to negation can be explained only by

cogitating a time which is either filled therewith or is void if i leave out

the notion of permanence which is existence in all time there remains in the

conception of substance nothing but the logical notion of subject a notion of

which i endeavour to realize by representing to myself something that can exist

only as a subject but not only am i perfectly ignorant of any conditions under

which this logical prerogative can belong to a thing i can make nothing out of

the notion and draw no inference from it because no object to which to apply

the conception is determined and we consequently do not know whether it has

any meaning at all in like manner if i leave out the notion of time in which

something follows upon some other thing in conformity with a rule i can find

nothing in the pure category except that there is a something of such a sort

that from it a conclusion may be drawn as to the existence of some other thing

but in this case it would not only be impossible to distinguish between a cause

and an effect but as this power to draw conclusions requires conditions of

which i am quite ignorant the conception is not determined as to the mode in

which it ought to apply to an object the socalled principle

everything that is contingent has a cause comes with a gravity

and selfassumed authority that seems to require no support from without but

i ask what is meant by contingent the answer is that the nonexistence of

which is possible but i should like very well to know by what means this

possibility of nonexistence is to be cognized if we do not represent to

ourselves a succession in the series of phenomena and in this succession an

existence which follows a nonexistence or conversely consequently change

for to say that the nonexistence of a thing is not selfcontradictory is a

lame appeal to a logical condition which is no doubt a necessary condition of

the existence of the conception but is far from being sufficient for the real

objective possibility of nonexistence i can annihilate in thought every

existing substance without selfcontradiction but i cannot infer from this

their objective contingency in existence that is to say the possibility of

their nonexistence in itself as regards the category of community it may

easily be inferred that as the pure categories of substance and causality are

incapable of a definition and explanation sufficient to determine their object

without the aid of intuition the category of reciprocal causality in the

relation of substances to each other commercium is just as little susceptible

thereof possibility existence and necessity nobody has ever yet been able to

explain without being guilty of manifest tautology when the definition has

been drawn entirely from the pure understanding for the substitution of the

logical possibility of the conceptionthe condition of which is that it

be not selfcontradictory for the transcendental possibility of

thingsthe condition of which is that there be an object corresponding to

the conception is a trick which can only deceive the inexperienced38

in one word to none of these conceptions belongs a corresponding object and

consequently their real possibility cannot be demonstrated if we take away

sensuous intuitionthe only intuition which we possessand there

then remains nothing but the logical possibility that is the fact that the

conception or thought is possiblewhich however is not the question

what we want to know being whether it relates to an object and thus possesses

any meaning




it follows incontestably that the pure conceptions of the understanding are

incapable of transcendental and must always be of empirical use alone and

that the principles of the pure understanding relate only to the general

conditions of a possible experience to objects of the senses and never to

things in general apart from the mode in which we intuite them




transcendental analytic has accordingly this important result to wit that the

understanding is competent effect nothing  priori except the anticipation of

the form of a possible experience in general and that as that which is not

phenomenon cannot be an object of experience it can never overstep the limits

of sensibility within which alone objects are presented to us its principles

are merely principles of the exposition of phenomena and the proud name of an

ontology which professes to present synthetical cognitions  priori of things

in general in a systematic doctrine must give place to the modest title of

analytic of the pure understanding




thought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object if the mode of

this intuition is unknown to us the object is merely transcendental and the

conception of the understanding is employed only transcendentally that is to

produce unity in the thought of a manifold in general now a pure category in

which all conditions of sensuous intuitionas the only intuition we

possessare abstracted does not determine an object but merely

expresses the thought of an object in general according to different modes

now to employ a conception the function of judgement is required by which an

object is subsumed under the conception consequently the at least formal

condition under which something can be given in intuition failing this

condition of judgement schema subsumption is impossible for there is in

such a case nothing given which may be subsumed under the conception the

merely transcendental use of the categories is therefore in fact no use at

all and has no determined or even as regards its form determinable object

hence it follows that the pure category is incompetent to establish a

synthetical  priori principle and that the principles of the pure

understanding are only of empirical and never of transcendental use and that

beyond the sphere of possible experience no synthetical  priori principles are

possible




it may be advisable therefore to express ourselves thus the pure categories

apart from the formal conditions of sensibility have a merely transcendental

meaning but are nevertheless not of transcendental use because this is in

itself impossible inasmuch as all the conditions of any employment or use of

them in judgements are absent to wit the formal conditions of the

subsumption of an object under these conceptions as therefore in the

character of pure categories they must be employed empirically and cannot be

employed transcendentally they are of no use at all when separated from

sensibility that is they cannot be applied to an object they are merely the

pure form of the employment of the understanding in respect of objects in

general and of thought without its being at the same time possible to think or

to determine any object by their means but there lurks at the foundation of

this subject an illusion which it is very difficult to avoid the categories

are not based as regards their origin upon sensibility like the forms of

intuition space and time they seem therefore to be capable of an

application beyond the sphere of sensuous objects but this is not the case

they are nothing but mere forms of thought which contain only the logical

faculty of uniting  priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition

apart then from the only intuition possible for us they have still less

meaning than the pure sensuous forms space and time for through them an

object is at least given while a mode of connection of the manifold when the

intuition which alone gives the manifold is wanting has no meaning at all at

the same time when we designate certain objects as phenomena or sensuous

existences thus distinguishing our mode of intuiting them from their own

nature as things in themselves it is evident that by this very distinction we

as it were place the latter considered in this their own nature although we

do not so intuite them in opposition to the former or on the other hand we

do so place other possible things which are not objects of our senses but are

cogitated by the understanding alone and call them intelligible existences

noumena now the question arises whether the pure conceptions of our

understanding do possess significance in respect of these latter and may

possibly be a mode of cognizing them




but we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity which may easily

occasion great misapprehension the understanding when it terms an object in a

certain relation phenomenon at the same time forms out of this relation a

representation or notion of an object in itself and hence believes that it can

form also conceptions of such objects now as the understanding possesses no

other fundamental conceptions besides the categories it takes for granted that

an object considered as a thing in itself must be capable of being thought by

means of these pure conceptions and is thereby led to hold the perfectly

undetermined conception of an intelligible existence a something out of the

sphere of our sensibility for a determinate conception of an existence which

we can cognize in some way or other by means of the understanding




if by the term noumenon we understand a thing so far as it is not an object

of our sensuous intuition thus making abstraction of our mode of intuiting it

this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word but if we understand by

it an object of a nonsensuous intuition we in this case assume a peculiar

mode of intuition an intellectual intuition to wit which does not however

belong to us of the very possibility of which we have no notionand this

is a noumenon in the positive sense




the doctrine of sensibility is also the doctrine of noumena in the negative

sense that is of things which the understanding is obliged to cogitate apart

from any relation to our mode of intuition consequently not as mere phenomena

but as things in themselves but the understanding at the same time comprehends

that it cannot employ its categories for the consideration of things in

themselves because these possess significance only in relation to the unity of

intuitions in space and time and that they are competent to determine this

unity by means of general  priori connecting conceptions only on account of

the pure ideality of space and time where this unity of time is not to be met

with as is the case with noumena the whole use indeed the whole meaning of

the categories is entirely lost for even the possibility of things to

correspond to the categories is in this case incomprehensible on this point i

need only refer the reader to what i have said at the commencement of the

general remark appended to the foregoing chapter now the possibility of a

thing can never be proved from the fact that the conception of it is not

selfcontradictory but only by means of an intuition corresponding to the

conception if therefore we wish to apply the categories to objects which

cannot be regarded as phenomena we must have an intuition different from the

sensuous and in this case the objects would be a noumena in the positive sense

of the word now as such an intuition that is an intellectual intuition is

no part of our faculty of cognition it is absolutely impossible for the

categories to possess any application beyond the limits of experience it may

be true that there are intelligible existences to which our faculty of sensuous

intuition has no relation and cannot be applied but our conceptions of the

understanding as mere forms of thought for our sensuous intuition do not

extend to these what therefore we call noumenon must be understood by us as

such in a negative sense




if i take away from an empirical intuition all thought by means of the

categories there remains no cognition of any object for by means of mere

intuition nothing is cogitated and from the existence of such or such an

affection of sensibility in me it does not follow that this affection or

representation has any relation to an object without me but if i take away all

intuition there still remains the form of thought that is the mode of

determining an object for the manifold of a possible intuition thus the

categories do in some measure really extend further than sensuous intuition

inasmuch as they think objects in general without regard to the mode of

sensibility in which these objects are given but they do not for this reason

apply to and determine a wider sphere of objects because we cannot assume that

such can be given without presupposing the possibility of another than the

sensuous mode of intuition a supposition we are not justified in making




i call a conception problematical which contains in itself no contradiction

and which is connected with other cognitions as a limitation of given

conceptions but whose objective reality cannot be cognized in any manner the

conception of a noumenon that is of a thing which must be cogitated not as an

object of sense but as a thing in itself solely through the pure

understanding is not selfcontradictory for we are not entitled to maintain

that sensibility is the only possible mode of intuition nay further this

conception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within the bounds of

phenomena and thus to limit the objective validity of sensuous cognition for

things in themselves which lie beyond its province are called noumena for the

very purpose of indicating that this cognition does not extend its application

to all that the understanding thinks but after all the possibility of such

noumena is quite incomprehensible and beyond the sphere of phenomena all is

for us a mere void that is to say we possess an understanding whose province

does problematically extend beyond this sphere but we do not possess an

intuition indeed not even the conception of a possible intuition by means of

which objects beyond the region of sensibility could be given us and in

reference to which the understanding might be employed assertorically the

conception of a noumenon is therefore merely a limitative conception and

therefore only of negative use but it is not an arbitrary or fictitious

notion but is connected with the limitation of sensibility without however

being capable of presenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere




the division of objects into phenomena and noumena and of the world into a

mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis is therefore quite inadmissible in a

positive sense although conceptions do certainly admit of such a division for

the class of noumena have no determinate object corresponding to them and

cannot therefore possess objective validity if we abandon the senses how can

it be made conceivable that the categories which are the only conceptions that

could serve as conceptions for noumena have any sense or meaning at all

inasmuch as something more than the mere unity of thought namely a possible

intuition is requisite for their application to an object the conception of a

noumenon considered as merely problematical is however not only admissible

but as a limitative conception of sensibility absolutely necessary but in

this case a noumenon is not a particular intelligible object for our

understanding on the contrary the kind of understanding to which it could

belong is itself a problem for we cannot form the most distant conception of

the possibility of an understanding which should cognize an object not

discursively by means of categories but intuitively in a nonsensuous

intuition our understanding attains in this way a sort of negative extension

that is to say it is not limited by but rather limits sensibility by giving

the name of noumena to things not considered as phenomena but as things in

themselves but it at the same time prescribes limits to itself for it

confesses itself unable to cognize these by means of the categories and hence

is compelled to cogitate them merely as an unknown something




i find however in the writings of modern authors an entirely different use

of the expressions mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis which quite departs

from the meaning of the ancientsan acceptation in which indeed there

is to be found no difficulty but which at the same time depends on mere verbal

quibbling according to this meaning some have chosen to call the complex of

phenomena in so far as it is intuited mundus sensibilis but in so far as the

connection thereof is cogitated according to general laws of thought mundus

intelligibilis astronomy in so far as we mean by the word the mere

observation of the starry heaven may represent the former a system of

astronomy such as the copernican or newtonian the latter but such twisting

of words is a mere sophistical subterfuge to avoid a difficult question by

modifying its meaning to suit our own convenience to be sure understanding

and reason are employed in the cognition of phenomena but the question is

whether these can be applied when the object is not a phenomenon and in this

sense we regard it if it is cogitated as given to the understanding alone and

not to the senses the question therefore is whether over and above the

empirical use of the understanding a transcendental use is possible which

applies to the noumenon as an object this question we have answered in the

negative




when therefore we say the senses represent objects as they appear the

understanding as they are the latter statement must not be understood in a

transcendental but only in an empirical signification that is as they must

be represented in the complete connection of phenomena and not according to

what they may be apart from their relation to possible experience

consequently not as objects of the pure understanding for this must ever

remain unknown to us nay it is also quite unknown to us whether any such

transcendental or extraordinary cognition is possible under any circumstances

at least whether it is possible by means of our categories understanding and

sensibility with us can determine objects only in conjunction if we separate

them we have intuitions without conceptions or conceptions without

intuitions in both cases representations which we cannot apply to any

determinate object




if after all our inquiries and explanations any one still hesitates to

abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories let him attempt to

construct with them a synthetical proposition it would of course be

unnecessary for this purpose to construct an analytical proposition for that

does not extend the sphere of the understanding but being concerned only

about what is cogitated in the conception itself it leaves it quite undecided

whether the conception has any relation to objects or merely indicates the

unity of thoughtcomplete abstraction being made of the modi in which an

object may be given in such a proposition it is sufficient for the

understanding to know what lies in the conceptionto what it applies is

to it indifferent the attempt must therefore be made with a synthetical and

socalled transcendental principle for example everything that exists

exists as substance or everything that is contingent exists as

an effect of some other thing viz of its cause now i ask whence can

the understanding draw these synthetical propositions when the conceptions

contained therein do not relate to possible experience but to things in

themselves noumena where is to be found the third term which is always

requisite pure site in a synthetical proposition which may connect in the same

proposition conceptions which have no logical analytical connection with each

other the proposition never will be demonstrated nay more the possibility

of any such pure assertion never can be shown without making reference to the

empirical use of the understanding and thus ipso facto completely renouncing

pure and nonsensuous judgement thus the conception of pure and merely

intelligible objects is completely void of all principles of its application

because we cannot imagine any mode in which they might be given and the

problematical thought which leaves a place open for them serves only like a

void space to limit the use of empirical principles without containing at the

same time any other object of cognition beyond their sphere


appendix


of the equivocal nature or amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection from the

confusion of the transcendental with the empirical use of the understanding




reflection reflexio is not occupied about objects themselves for the purpose

of directly obtaining conceptions of them but is that state of the mind in

which we set ourselves to discover the subjective conditions under which we

obtain conceptions it is the consciousness of the relation of given

representations to the different sources or faculties of cognition by which

alone their relation to each other can be rightly determined the first

question which occurs in considering our representations is to what faculty of

cognition do they belong to the understanding or to the senses many

judgements are admitted to be true from mere habit or inclination but because

reflection neither precedes nor follows it is held to be a judgement that has

its origin in the understanding all judgements do not require examination

that is investigation into the grounds of their truth for when they are

immediately certain for example between two points there can be only

one straight line no better or less mediate test of their truth can be

found than that which they themselves contain and express but all judgement

nay all comparisons require reflection that is a distinction of the faculty

of cognition to which the given conceptions belong the act whereby i compare

my representations with the faculty of cognition which originates them and

whereby i distinguish whether they are compared with each other as belonging to

the pure understanding or to sensuous intuition i term transcendental

reflection now the relations in which conceptions can stand to each other are

those of identity and difference agreement and opposition of the internal and

external finally of the determinable and the determining matter and form

the proper determination of these relations rests on the question to what

faculty of cognition they subjectively belong whether to sensibility or

understanding for on the manner in which we solve this question depends the

manner in which we must cogitate these relations




before constructing any objective judgement we compare the conceptions that

are to be placed in the judgement and observe whether there exists identity

of many representations in one conception if a general judgement is to be

constructed or difference if a particular whether there is agreement when

affirmative and opposition when negative judgements are to be constructed and

so on for this reason we ought to call these conceptions conceptions of

comparison conceptus comparationis but as when the question is not as to

the logical form but as to the content of conceptions that is to say whether

the things themselves are identical or different in agreement or opposition

and so on the things can have a twofold relation to our faculty of cognition

to wit a relation either to sensibility or to the understanding and as on

this relation depends their relation to each other transcendental reflection

that is the relation of given representations to one or the other faculty of

cognition can alone determine this latter relation thus we shall not be able

to discover whether the things are identical or different in agreement or

opposition etc from the mere conception of the things by means of comparison

comparatio but only by distinguishing the mode of cognition to which they

belong in other words by means of transcendental reflection we may

therefore with justice say that logical reflection is mere comparison for in

it no account is taken of the faculty of cognition to which the given

conceptions belong and they are consequently as far as regards their origin

to be treated as homogeneous while transcendental reflection which applies to

the objects themselves contains the ground of the possibility of objective

comparison of representations with each other and is therefore very different

from the former because the faculties of cognition to which they belong are

not even the same transcendental reflection is a duty which no one can neglect

who wishes to establish an  priori judgement upon things we shall now proceed

to fulfil this duty and thereby throw not a little light on the question as to

the determination of the proper business of the understanding




1 identity and difference when an object is presented to us several times

but always with the same internal determinations qualitas et quantitas it

if an object of pure understanding is always the same not several things but

only one thing numerica identitas but if a phenomenon we do not concern

ourselves with comparing the conception of the thing with the conception of

some other but although they may be in this respect perfectly the same the

difference of place at the same time is a sufficient ground for asserting the

numerical difference of these objects of sense thus in the case of two

drops of water we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference

quality and quantity and the fact that they are intuited at the same time

in different places is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be

numerically different leibnitz regarded phenomena as things in themselves

consequently as intelligibilia that is objects of pure understanding

although on account of the confused nature of their representations he gave

them the name of phenomena and in this case his principle of the

indiscernible principium identatis indiscernibilium is not to be impugned

but as phenomena are objects of sensibility and as the understanding in

respect of them must be employed empirically and not purely or

transcendentally plurality and numerical difference are given by space itself

as the condition of external phenomena for one part of space although it may

be perfectly similar and equal to another part is still without it and for

this reason alone is different from the latter which is added to it in order

to make up a greater space it follows that this must hold good of all things

that are in the different parts of space at the same time however similar and

equal one may be to another




2 agreement and opposition when reality is represented by the pure

understanding realitas noumenon opposition between realities is

incogitablesuch a relation that is that when these realities are

connected in one subject they annihilate the effects of each other and may be

represented in the formula 3 3  0 on the other hand the real in a

phenomenon realitas phaenomenon may very well be in mutual opposition and

when united in the same subject the one may completely or in part annihilate

the effect or consequence of the other as in the case of two moving forces in

the same straight line drawing or impelling a point in opposite directions or

in the case of a pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain




3 the internal and external in an object of the pure understanding only that

is internal which has no relation as regards its existence to anything

different from itself on the other hand the internal determinations of a

substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing but relations and it is itself

nothing more than a complex of mere relations substance in space we are

cognizant of only through forces operative in it either drawing others towards

itself attraction or preventing others from forcing into itself repulsion

and impenetrability we know no other properties that make up the conception

of substance phenomenal in space and which we term matter on the other hand

as an object of the pure understanding every substance must have internal

determination and forces but what other internal attributes of such an object

can i think than those which my internal sense presents to me that to wit

which in either itself thought or something analogous to it hence leibnitz

who looked upon things as noumena after denying them everything like external

relation and therefore also composition or combination declared that all

substances even the component parts of matter were simple substances with

powers of representation in one word monads




4 matter and form these two conceptions lie at the foundation of all other

reflection so inseparably are they connected with every mode of exercising the

understanding the former denotes the determinable in general the second its

determination both in a transcendental sense abstraction being made of every

difference in that which is given and of the mode in which it is determined

logicians formerly termed the universal matter the specific difference of

this or that part of the universal form in a judgement one may call the given

conceptions logical matter for the judgement the relation of these to each

other by means of the copula the form of the judgement in an object the

composite parts thereof essentialia are the matter the mode in which they

are connected in the object the form in respect to things in general

unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all possibility the limitation

thereof negation as the form by which one thing is distinguished from

another according to transcendental conceptions the understanding demands that

something be given at least in the conception in order to be able to

determine it in a certain manner hence in a conception of the pure

understanding the matter precedes the form and for this reason leibnitz first

assumed the existence of things monads and of an internal power of

representation in them in order to found upon this their external relation and

the community their state that is of their representations hence with him

space and time were possiblethe former through the relation of

substances the latter through the connection of their determinations with each

other as causes and effects and so would it really be if the pure

understanding were capable of an immediate application to objects and if space

and time were determinations of things in themselves but being merely sensuous

intuitions in which we determine all objects solely as phenomena the form of

intuition as a subjective property of sensibility must antecede all matter

sensations consequently space and time must antecede all phenomena and all

data of experience and rather make experience itself possible but the

intellectual philosopher could not endure that the form should precede the

things themselves and determine their possibility an objection perfectly

correct if we assume that we intuite things as they are although with

confused representation but as sensuous intuition is a peculiar subjective

condition which is  priori at the foundation of all perception and the form

of which is primitive the form must be given per se and so far from matter

or the things themselves which appear lying at the foundation of experience

as we must conclude if we judge by mere conceptions the very possibility of

itself presupposes on the contrary a given formal intuition space and time




remark on the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection




let me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conception either

in the sensibility or in the pure understanding the transcendental place in

this manner the appointment of the position which must be taken by each

conception according to the difference in its use and the directions for

determining this place to all conceptions according to rules would be a

transcendental topic a doctrine which would thoroughly shield us from the

surreptitious devices of the pure understanding and the delusions which thence

arise as it would always distinguish to what faculty of cognition each

conception properly belonged every conception every title under which many

cognitions rank together may be called a logical place upon this is based the

logical topic of aristotle of which teachers and rhetoricians could avail

themselves in order under certain titles of thought to observe what would

best suit the matter they had to treat and thus enable themselves to quibble

and talk with fluency and an appearance of profundity




transcendental topic on the contrary contains nothing more than the

abovementioned four titles of all comparison and distinction which differ

from categories in this respect that they do not represent the object

according to that which constitutes its conception quantity reality but set

forth merely the comparison of representations which precedes our conceptions

of things but this comparison requires a previous reflection that is a

determination of the place to which the representations of the things which are

compared belong whether to wit they are cogitated by the pure understanding

or given by sensibility




conceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiring to what

faculty their objects belong whether as noumena to the understanding or as

phenomena to sensibility if however we wish to employ these conceptions in

respect of objects previous transcendental reflection is necessary without

this reflection i should make a very unsafe use of these conceptions and

construct pretended synthetical propositions which critical reason cannot

acknowledge and which are based solely upon a transcendental amphiboly that

is upon a substitution of an object of pure understanding for a phenomenon




for want of this doctrine of transcendental topic and consequently deceived by

the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection the celebrated leibnitz

constructed an intellectual system of the world or rather believed himself

competent to cognize the internal nature of things by comparing all objects

merely with the understanding and the abstract formal conceptions of thought

our table of the conceptions of reflection gives us the unexpected advantage of

being able to exhibit the distinctive peculiarities of his system in all its

parts and at the same time of exposing the fundamental principle of this

peculiar mode of thought which rested upon naught but a misconception he

compared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions and

naturally found no other differences than those by which the understanding

distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another the conditions of sensuous

intuition which contain in themselves their own means of distinction he did

not look upon as primitive because sensibility was to him but a confused mode

of representation and not any particular source of representations a

phenomenon was for him the representation of the thing in itself although

distinguished from cognition by the understanding only in respect of the

logical formthe former with its usual want of analysis containing

according to him a certain mixture of collateral representations in its

conception of a thing which it is the duty of the understanding to separate

and distinguish in one word leibnitz intellectualized phenomena just as

locke in his system of noogony if i may be allowed to make use of such

expressions sensualized the conceptions of the understanding that is to say

declared them to be nothing more than empirical or abstract conceptions of

reflection instead of seeking in the understanding and sensibility two

different sources of representations which however can present us with

objective judgements of things only in conjunction each of these great men

recognized but one of these faculties which in their opinion applied

immediately to things in themselves the other having no duty but that of

confusing or arranging the representations of the former




accordingly the objects of sense were compared by leibnitz as things in

general merely in the understanding




1st he compares them in regard to their identity or differenceas judged

by the understanding as therefore he considered merely the conceptions of

objects and not their position in intuition in which alone objects can be

given and left quite out of sight the transcendental locale of these

conceptionswhether that is their object ought to be classed among

phenomena or among things in themselves it was to be expected that he should

extend the application of the principle of indiscernibles which is valid

solely of conceptions of things in general to objects of sense mundus

phaenomenon and that he should believe that he had thereby contributed in no

small degree to extend our knowledge of nature in truth if i cognize in all

its inner determinations a drop of water as a thing in itself i cannot look

upon one drop as different from another if the conception of the one is

completely identical with that of the other but if it is a phenomenon in

space it has a place not merely in the understanding among conceptions but

also in sensuous external intuition in space and in this case the physical

locale is a matter of indifference in regard to the internal determinations of

things and one place b may contain a thing which is perfectly similar and

equal to another in a place a just as well as if the two things were in every

respect different from each other difference of place without any other

conditions makes the plurality and distinction of objects as phenomena not

only possible in itself but even necessary consequently the above socalled

law is not a law of nature it is merely an analytical rule for the comparison

of things by means of mere conceptions




2nd the principle realities as simple affirmations never logically

contradict each other is a proposition perfectly true respecting the

relation of conceptions but whether as regards nature or things in

themselves of which we have not the slightest conception is without any the

least meaning for real opposition in which a b is  0 exists everywhere an

opposition that is in which one reality united with another in the same

subject annihilates the effects of the othera fact which is constantly

brought before our eyes by the different antagonistic actions and operations in

nature which nevertheless as depending on real forces must be called

realitates phaenomena general mechanics can even present us with the empirical

condition of this opposition in an  priori rule as it directs its attention

to the opposition in the direction of forcesa condition of which the

transcendental conception of reality can tell us nothing although m leibnitz

did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of a new principle

he yet employed it for the establishment of new propositions and his followers

introduced it into their leibnitziowolfian system of philosophy according to

this principle for example all evils are but consequences of the limited

nature of created beings that is negations because these are the only

opposite of reality in the mere conception of a thing in general this is

really the case but not in things as phenomena in like manner the upholders

of this system deem it not only possible but natural also to connect and

unite all reality in one being because they acknowledge no other sort of

opposition than that of contradiction by which the conception itself of a

thing is annihilated and find themselves unable to conceive an opposition of

reciprocal destruction so to speak in which one real cause destroys the

effect of another and the conditions of whose representation we meet with only

in sensibility




3rd the leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than on this

philosophers mode of falsely representing the difference of the internal

and external solely in relation to the understanding substances in general

must have something inward which is therefore free from external relations

consequently from that of composition also the simplethat which can be

represented by a unitis therefore the foundation of that which is

internal in things in themselves the internal state of substances cannot

therefore consist in place shape contact or motion determinations which are

all external relations and we can ascribe to them no other than that whereby

we internally determine our faculty of sense itself that is to say the state

of representation thus then were constructed the monads which were to form

the elements of the universe the active force of which consists in

representation the effects of this force being thus entirely confined to

themselves




for the same reason his view of the possible community of substances could not

represent it but as a predetermined harmony and by no means as a physical

influence for inasmuch as everything is occupied only internally that is

with its own representations the state of the representations of one substance

could not stand in active and living connection with that of another but some

third cause operating on all without exception was necessary to make the

different states correspond with one another and this did not happen by means

of assistance applied in each particular case systema assistentiae but

through the unity of the idea of a cause occupied and connected with all

substances in which they necessarily receive according to the leibnitzian

school their existence and permanence consequently also reciprocal

correspondence according to universal laws




4th this philosophers celebrated doctrine of space and time in which

he intellectualized these forms of sensibility originated in the same delusion

of transcendental reflection if i attempt to represent by the mere

understanding the external relations of things i can do so only by employing

the conception of their reciprocal action and if i wish to connect one state

of the same thing with another state i must avail myself of the notion of the

order of cause and effect and thus leibnitz regarded space as a certain order

in the community of substances and time as the dynamical sequence of their

states that which space and time possess proper to themselves and independent

of things he ascribed to a necessary confusion in our conceptions of them

whereby that which is a mere form of dynamical relations is held to be a

selfexistent intuition antecedent even to things themselves thus space and

time were the intelligible form of the connection of things substances and

their states in themselves but things were intelligible substances

substantiae noumena at the same time he made these conceptions valid of

phenomena because he did not allow to sensibility a peculiar mode of

intuition but sought all even the empirical representation of objects in the

understanding and left to sense naught but the despicable task of confusing

and disarranging the representations of the former




but even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerning things in

themselves by means of the pure understanding which is impossible it could

not apply to phenomena which do not represent things in themselves in such a

case i should be obliged in transcendental reflection to compare my conceptions

only under the conditions of sensibility and so space and time would not be

determinations of things in themselves but of phenomena what things may be in

themselves i know not and need not know because a thing is never presented to

me otherwise than as a phenomenon




i must adopt the same mode of procedure with the other conceptions of

reflection matter is substantia phaenomenon that in it which is internal i

seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies and in all the

functions and operations it performs and which are indeed never anything but

phenomena of the external sense i cannot therefore find anything that is

absolutely but only what is comparatively internal and which itself consists

of external relations the absolutely internal in matter and as it should be

according to the pure understanding is a mere chimera for matter is not an

object for the pure understanding but the transcendental object which is the

foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter is a mere nescio quid the

nature of which we could not understand even though someone were found able to

tell us for we can understand nothing that does not bring with it something in

intuition corresponding to the expressions employed if by the complaint of

being unable to perceive the internal nature of things it is meant that we do

not comprehend by the pure understanding what the things which appear to us may

be in themselves it is a silly and unreasonable complaint for those who talk

thus really desire that we should be able to cognize consequently to intuite

things without senses and therefore wish that we possessed a faculty of

cognition perfectly different from the human faculty not merely in degree but

even as regards intuition and the mode thereof so that thus we should not be

men but belong to a class of beings the possibility of whose existence much

less their nature and constitution we have no means of cognizing by

observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate into the interior of nature

and no one can say what progress this knowledge may make in time but those

transcendental questions which pass beyond the limits of nature we could never

answer even although all nature were laid open to us because we have not the

power of observing our own mind with any other intuition than that of our

internal sense for herein lies the mystery of the origin and source of our

faculty of sensibility its application to an object and the transcendental

ground of this unity of subjective and objective lie too deeply concealed for

us who cognize ourselves only through the internal sense consequently as

phenomena to be able to discover in our existence anything but phenomena the

nonsensuous cause of which we at the same time earnestly desire to penetrate

to




the great utility of this critique of conclusions arrived at by the processes

of mere reflection consists in its clear demonstration of the nullity of all

conclusions respecting objects which are compared with each other in the

understanding alone while it at the same time confirms what we particularly

insisted on namely that although phenomena are not included as things in

themselves among the objects of the pure understanding they are nevertheless

the only things by which our cognition can possess objective reality that is

to say which give us intuitions to correspond with our conceptions




when we reflect in a purely logical manner we do nothing more than compare

conceptions in our understanding to discover whether both have the same

content whether they are selfcontradictory or not whether anything is

contained in either conception which of the two is given and which is merely

a mode of thinking that given but if i apply these conceptions to an object in

general in the transcendental sense without first determining whether it is

an object of sensuous or intellectual intuition certain limitations present

themselves which forbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all

empirical use of them impossible and thus these limitations prove that the

representation of an object as a thing in general is not only insufficient

but without sensuous determination and independently of empirical conditions

selfcontradictory that we must therefore make abstraction of all objects as

in logic or admitting them must think them under conditions of sensuous

intuition that consequently the intelligible requires an altogether peculiar

intuition which we do not possess and in the absence of which it is for us

nothing while on the other hand phenomena cannot be objects in themselves

for when i merely think things in general the difference in their external

relations cannot constitute a difference in the things themselves on the

contrary the former presupposes the latter and if the conception of one of

two things is not internally different from that of the other i am merely

thinking the same thing in different relations further by the addition of one

affirmation reality to the other the positive therein is really augmented

and nothing is abstracted or withdrawn from it hence the real in things cannot

be in contradiction with or opposition to itselfand so on




the true use of the conceptions of reflection in the employment of the

understanding has as we have shown been so misconceived by leibnitz one of

the most acute philosophers of either ancient or modern times that he has been

misled into the construction of a baseless system of intellectual cognition

which professes to determine its objects without the intervention of the

senses for this reason the exposition of the cause of the amphiboly of these

conceptions as the origin of these false principles is of great utility in

determining with certainty the proper limits of the understanding




it is right to say whatever is affirmed or denied of the whole of a conception

can be affirmed or denied of any part of it dictum de omni et nullo but it

would be absurd so to alter this logical proposition as to say whatever is not

contained in a general conception is likewise not contained in the particular

conceptions which rank under it for the latter are particular conceptions for

the very reason that their content is greater than that which is cogitated in

the general conception and yet the whole intellectual system of leibnitz is

based upon this false principle and with it must necessarily fall to the

ground together with all the ambiguous principles in reference to the

employment of the understanding which have thence originated




leibnitzs principle of the identity of indiscernibles or

indistinguishables is really based on the presupposition that if in the

conception of a thing a certain distinction is not to be found it is also not

to be met with in things themselves that consequently all things are

completely identical numero eadem which are not distinguishable from each

other as to quality or quantity in our conceptions of them but as in the

mere conception of anything abstraction has been made of many necessary

conditions of intuition that of which abstraction has been made is rashly held

to be nonexistent and nothing is attributed to the thing but what is

contained in its conception




the conception of a cubic foot of space however i may think it is in itself

completely identical but two cubic feet in space are nevertheless distinct

from each other from the sole fact of their being in different places they are

numero diversa and these places are conditions of intuition wherein the

object of this conception is given and which do not belong to the conception

but to the faculty of sensibility in like manner there is in the conception

of a thing no contradiction when a negative is not connected with an

affirmative and merely affirmative conceptions cannot in conjunction produce

any negation but in sensuous intuition wherein reality take for example

motion is given we find conditions opposite directionsof which

abstraction has been made in the conception of motion in generalwhich

render possible a contradiction or opposition not indeed of a logical

kindand which from pure positives produce zero  0 we are therefore

not justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement and harmony

because no contradiction is discoverable among its conceptions39 according to mere conceptions that

which is internal is the substratum of all relations or external

determinations when therefore i abstract all conditions of intuition and

confine myself solely to the conception of a thing in general i can make

abstraction of all external relations and there must nevertheless remain a

conception of that which indicates no relation but merely internal

determinations now it seems to follow that in everything substance there is

something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes all external

determinations inasmuch as it renders them possible and that therefore this

substratum is something which does not contain any external relations and is

consequently simple for corporeal things are never anything but relations at

least of their parts external to each other and inasmuch as we know of no

other absolutely internal determinations than those of the internal sense this

substratum is not only simple but also analogously with our internal sense

determined through representations that is to say all things are properly

monads or simple beings endowed with the power of representation now all this

would be perfectly correct if the conception of a thing were the only

necessary condition of the presentation of objects of external intuition it

is on the contrary manifest that a permanent phenomenon in space

impenetrable extension can contain mere relations and nothing that is

absolutely internal and yet be the primary substratum of all external

perception by mere conceptions i cannot think anything external without at

the same time thinking something internal for the reason that conceptions of

relations presuppose given things and without these are impossible but as an

intuition there is something that is space which with all it contains

consists of purely formal or indeed real relations which is not found in

the mere conception of a thing in general and this presents to us the

substratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone i cannot say

because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptions without something

absolutely internal there is also in the things themselves which are

contained under these conceptions and in their intuition nothing external to

which something absolutely internal does not serve as the foundation for when

we have made abstraction of all the conditions of intuition there certainly

remains in the mere conception nothing but the internal in general through

which alone the external is possible but this necessity which is grounded

upon abstraction alone does not obtain in the case of things themselves in so

far as they are given in intuition with such determinations as express mere

relations without having anything internal as their foundation for they are

not things of a thing of which we can neither for they are not things in

themselves but only phenomena what we cognize in matter is nothing but

relations what we call its internal determinations are but comparatively

internal but there are some selfsubsistent and permanent through which a

determined object is given that i when abstraction is made of these

relations have nothing more to think does not destroy the conception of a

thing as phenomenon nor the conception of an object in abstracto but it does

away with the possibility of an object that is determinable according to mere

conceptions that is of a noumenon it is certainly startling to hear that a

thing consists solely of relations but this thing is simply a phenomenon and

cannot be cogitated by means of the mere categories it does itself consist in

the mere relation of something in general to the senses in the same way we

cannot cogitate relations of things in abstracto if we commence with

conceptions alone in any other manner than that one is the cause of

determinations in the other for that is itself the conception of the

understanding or category of relation but as in this case we make abstraction

of all intuition we lose altogether the mode in which the manifold determines

to each of its parts its place that is the form of sensibility space and

yet this mode antecedes all empirical causality



 39

if any one wishes here to have recourse to the usual subterfuge and to say

that at least realitates noumena cannot be in opposition to each other it will

be requisite for him to adduce an example of this pure and nonsensuous

reality that it may be understood whether the notion represents something or

nothing but an example cannot be found except in experience which never

presents to us anything more than phenomena and thus the proposition means

nothing more than that the conception which contains only affirmatives does not

contain anything negativea proposition nobody ever doubted




if by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought by means

of the pure categories without the need of the schemata of sensibility such

objects are impossible for the condition of the objective use of all our

conceptions of understanding is the mode of our sensuous intuition whereby

objects are given and if we make abstraction of the latter the former can

have no relation to an object and even if we should suppose a different kind

of intuition from our own still our functions of thought would have no use or

signification in respect thereof but if we understand by the term objects of

a nonsensuous intuition in respect of which our categories are not valid and

of which we can accordingly have no knowledge neither intuition nor

conception in this merely negative sense noumena must be admitted for this

is no more than saying that our mode of intuition is not applicable to all

things but only to objects of our senses that consequently its objective

validity is limited and that room is therefore left for another kind of

intuition and thus also for things that may be objects of it but in this

sense the conception of a noumenon is problematical that is to say it is the

notion of that it that it is possible nor that it is impossible inasmuch as

we do not know of any mode of intuition besides the sensuous or of any other

sort of conceptions than the categoriesa mode of intuition and a kind of

conception neither of which is applicable to a nonsensuous object we are on

this account incompetent to extend the sphere of our objects of thought beyond

the conditions of our sensibility and to assume the existence of objects of

pure thought that is of noumena inasmuch as these have no true positive

signification for it must be confessed of the categories that they are not of

themselves sufficient for the cognition of things in themselves and without

the data of sensibility are mere subjective forms of the unity of the

understanding thought is certainly not a product of the senses and in so far

is not limited by them but it does not therefore follow that it may be

employed purely and without the intervention of sensibility for it would then

be without reference to an object and we cannot call a noumenon an object of

pure thought for the representation thereof is but the problematical

conception of an object for a perfectly different intuition and a perfectly

different understanding from ours both of which are consequently themselves

problematical the conception of a noumenon is therefore not the conception of

an object but merely a problematical conception inseparably connected with the

limitation of our sensibility that is to say this conception contains the

answer to the question are there objects quite unconnected with and

independent of our intuitiona question to which only an

indeterminate answer can be given that answer is inasmuch as sensuous

intuition does not apply to all things without distinction there remains room

for other and different objects the existence of these problematical

objects is therefore not absolutely denied in the absence of a determinate

conception of them but as no category is valid in respect of them neither

must they be admitted as objects for our understanding




understanding accordingly limits sensibility without at the same time

enlarging its own field while moreover it forbids sensibility to apply its

forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it to the sphere of

phenomena it cogitates an object in itself only however as a transcendental

object which is the cause of a phenomenon consequently not itself a

phenomenon and which cannot be thought either as a quantity or as reality or

as substance because these conceptions always require sensuous forms in which

to determine an objectan object therefore of which we are quite

unable to say whether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us whether it

would be annihilated together with sensibility or if this were taken away

would continue to exist if we wish to call this object a noumenon because the

representation of it is nonsensuous we are at liberty to do so but as we can

apply to it none of the conceptions of our understanding the representation is

for us quite void and is available only for the indication of the limits of

our sensuous intuition thereby leaving at the same time an empty space which

we are competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience nor of the

pure understanding




the critique of the pure understanding accordingly does not permit us to

create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which are presented to

us as phenomena and to stray into intelligible worlds nay it does not even

allow us to endeavour to form so much as a conception of them the specious

error which leads to thisand which is a perfectly excusable

onelies in the fact that the employment of the understanding contrary

to its proper purpose and destination is made transcendental and objects

that is possible intuitions are made to regulate themselves according to

conceptions instead of the conceptions arranging themselves according to the

intuitions on which alone their own objective validity rests now the reason

of this again is that apperception and with it thought antecedes all possible

determinate arrangement of representations accordingly we think something in

general and determine it on the one hand sensuously but on the other

distinguish the general and in abstracto represented object from this

particular mode of intuiting it in this case there remains a mode of

determining the object by mere thought which is really but a logical form

without content which however seems to us to be a mode of the existence of

the object in itself noumenon without regard to intuition which is limited

to our senses




before ending this transcendental analytic we must make an addition which

although in itself of no particular importance seems to be necessary to the

completeness of the system the highest conception with which a transcendental

philosophy commonly begins is the division into possible and impossible but

as all division presupposes a divided conception a still higher one must

exist and this is the conception of an object in generalproblematically

understood and without its being decided whether it is something or nothing as

the categories are the only conceptions which apply to objects in general the

distinguishing of an object whether it is something or nothing must proceed

according to the order and direction of the categories




1 to the categories of quantity that is the conceptions of all many and

one the conception which annihilates all that is the conception of none is

opposed and thus the object of a conception to which no intuition can be

found to correspond is  nothing that is it is a conception without an

object ens rationis like noumena which cannot be considered possible in the

sphere of reality though they must not therefore be held to be

impossibleor like certain new fundamental forces in matter the

existence of which is cogitable without contradiction though as examples from

experience are not forthcoming they must not be regarded as possible




2 reality is something negation is nothing that is a conception of the

absence of an object as cold a shadow nihil privativum




3 the mere form of intuition without substance is in itself no object but

the merely formal condition of an object as phenomenon as pure space and

pure time these are certainly something as forms of intuition but are not

themselves objects which are intuited ens imaginarium




4 the object of a conception which is selfcontradictory is nothing because

the conception is nothingis impossible as a figure composed of two

straight lines nihil negativum




the table of this division of the conception of nothing the corresponding

division of the conception of something does not require special description

must therefore be arranged as follows




                      nothing

                        as



                        1

                as empty conception

                 without object

                  ens rationis

           2                               3

     empty object of               empty intuition

      a conception                without object

     nihil privativum              ens imaginarium

                        4

                   empty object

                 without conception

                  nihil negativum




we see that the ens rationis is distinguished from the nihil negativum or pure

nothing by the consideration that the former must not be reckoned among

possibilities because it is a mere fictionthough not

selfcontradictory while the latter is completely opposed to all possibility

inasmuch as the conception annihilates itself both however are empty

conceptions on the other hand the nihil privativum and ens imaginarium are

empty data for conceptions if light be not given to the senses we cannot

represent to ourselves darkness and if extended objects are not perceived we

cannot represent space neither the negation nor the mere form of intuition

can without something real be an object


second divisiontranscendental logic
transcendental dialectic

introduction
i of transcendental illusory appearance


we termed dialectic in general a logic of appearance this does not signify a

doctrine of probability for probability is truth only cognized upon

insufficient grounds and though the information it gives us is imperfect it

is not therefore deceitful hence it must not be separated from the analytical

part of logic still less must phenomenon and appearance be held to be

identical for truth or illusory appearance does not reside in the object in

so far as it is intuited but in the judgement upon the object in so far as it

is thought it is therefore quite correct to say that the senses do not err

not because they always judge correctly but because they do not judge at all

hence truth and error consequently also illusory appearance as the cause of

error are only to be found in a judgement that is in the relation of an

object to our understanding in a cognition which completely harmonizes with

the laws of the understanding no error can exist in a representation of the

sensesas not containing any judgementthere is also no error but

no power of nature can of itself deviate from its own laws hence neither the

understanding per se without the influence of another cause nor the senses

per se would fall into error the former could not because if it acts only

according to its own laws the effect the judgement must necessarily accord

with these laws but in accordance with the laws of the understanding consists

the formal element in all truth in the senses there is no

judgementneither a true nor a false one but as we have no source of

cognition besides these two it follows that error is caused solely by the

unobserved influence of the sensibility upon the understanding and thus it

happens that the subjective grounds of a judgement and are confounded with the

objective and cause them to deviate from their proper determination40 just as a body in motion would always

of itself proceed in a straight line but if another impetus gives to it a

different direction it will then start off into a curvilinear line of motion

to distinguish the peculiar action of the understanding from the power which

mingles with it it is necessary to consider an erroneous judgement as the

diagonal between two forces that determine the judgement in two different

directions which as it were form an angle and to resolve this composite

operation into the simple ones of the understanding and the sensibility in

pure  priori judgements this must be done by means of transcendental

reflection whereby as has been already shown each representation has its

place appointed in the corresponding faculty of cognition and consequently the

influence of the one faculty upon the other is made apparent



 40

sensibility subjected to the understanding as the object upon which the

understanding employs its functions is the source of real cognitions but in

so far as it exercises an influence upon the action of the understanding and

determines it to judgement sensibility is itself the cause of error




it is not at present our business to treat of empirical illusory appearance

for example optical illusion which occurs in the empirical application of

otherwise correct rules of the understanding and in which the judgement is

misled by the influence of imagination our purpose is to speak of

transcendental illusory appearance which influences principlesthat are

not even applied to experience for in this case we should possess a sure test

of their correctnessbut which leads us in disregard of all the warnings

of criticism completely beyond the empirical employment of the categories and

deludes us with the chimera of an extension of the sphere of the pure

understanding we shall term those principles the application of which is

confined entirely within the limits of possible experience immanent those on

the other hand which transgress these limits we shall call transcendent

principles but by these latter i do not understand principles of the

transcendental use or misuse of the categories which is in reality a mere

fault of the judgement when not under due restraint from criticism and

therefore not paying sufficient attention to the limits of the sphere in which

the pure understanding is allowed to exercise its functions but real

principles which exhort us to break down all those barriers and to lay claim

to a perfectly new field of cognition which recognizes no line of demarcation

thus transcendental and transcendent are not identical terms the principles of

the pure understanding which we have already propounded ought to be of

empirical and not of transcendental use that is they are not applicable to

any object beyond the sphere of experience a principle which removes these

limits nay which authorizes us to overstep them is called transcendent if

our criticism can succeed in exposing the illusion in these pretended

principles those which are limited in their employment to the sphere of

experience may be called in opposition to the others immanent principles of

the pure understanding




logical illusion which consists merely in the imitation of the form of reason

the illusion in sophistical syllogisms arises entirely from a want of due

attention to logical rules so soon as the attention is awakened to the case

before us this illusion totally disappears transcendental illusion on the

contrary does not cease to exist even after it has been exposed and its

nothingness clearly perceived by means of transcendental criticism take for

example the illusion in the proposition the world must have a

beginning in time the cause of this is as follows in our reason

subjectively considered as a faculty of human cognition there exist

fundamental rules and maxims of its exercise which have completely the

appearance of objective principles now from this cause it happens that the

subjective necessity of a certain connection of our conceptions is regarded as

an objective necessity of the determination of things in themselves this

illusion it is impossible to avoid just as we cannot avoid perceiving that the

sea appears to be higher at a distance than it is near the shore because we

see the former by means of higher rays than the latter or which is a still

stronger case as even the astronomer cannot prevent himself from seeing the

moon larger at its rising than some time afterwards although he is not

deceived by this illusion




transcendental dialectic will therefore content itself with exposing the

illusory appearance in transcendental judgements and guarding us against it

but to make it as in the case of logical illusion entirely disappear and

cease to be illusion is utterly beyond its power for we have here to do with a

natural and unavoidable illusion which rests upon subjective principles and

imposes these upon us as objective while logical dialectic in the detection

of sophisms has to do merely with an error in the logical consequence of the

propositions or with an artificially constructed illusion in imitation of the

natural error there is therefore a natural and unavoidable dialectic of pure

reasonnot that in which the bungler from want of the requisite

knowledge involves himself nor that which the sophist devises for the purpose

of misleading but that which is an inseparable adjunct of human reason and

which even after its illusions have been exposed does not cease to deceive

and continually to lead reason into momentary errors which it becomes

necessary continually to remove


ii of pure reason as the seat of transcendental

illusory appearance


a of reason in general




all our knowledge begins with sense proceeds thence to understanding and ends

with reason beyond which nothing higher can be discovered in the human mind

for elaborating the matter of intuition and subjecting it to the highest unity

of thought at this stage of our inquiry it is my duty to give an explanation

of this the highest faculty of cognition and i confess i find myself here in

some difficulty of reason as of the understanding there is a merely formal

that is logical use in which it makes abstraction of all content of

cognition but there is also a real use inasmuch as it contains in itself the

source of certain conceptions and principles which it does not borrow either

from the senses or the understanding the former faculty has been long defined

by logicians as the faculty of mediate conclusion in contradistinction to

immediate conclusions consequentiae immediatae but the nature of the latter

which itself generates conceptions is not to be understood from this

definition now as a division of reason into a logical and a transcendental

faculty presents itself here it becomes necessary to seek for a higher

conception of this source of cognition which shall comprehend both conceptions

in this we may expect according to the analogy of the conceptions of the

understanding that the logical conception will give us the key to the

transcendental and that the table of the functions of the former will present

us with the clue to the conceptions of reason




in the former part of our transcendental logic we defined the understanding to

be the faculty of rules reason may be distinguished from understanding as the

faculty of principles




the term principle is ambiguous and commonly signifies merely a cognition that

may be employed as a principle although it is not in itself and as regards

its proper origin entitled to the distinction every general proposition even

if derived from experience by the process of induction may serve as the major

in a syllogism but it is not for that reason a principle mathematical axioms

for example there can be only one straight line between two points are

general  priori cognitions and are therefore rightly denominated principles

relatively to the cases which can be subsumed under them but i cannot for this

reason say that i cognize this property of a straight line from

principlesi cognize it only in pure intuition




cognition from principles then is that cognition in which i cognize the

particular in the general by means of conceptions thus every syllogism is a

form of the deduction of a cognition from a principle for the major always

gives a conception through which everything that is subsumed under the

condition thereof is cognized according to a principle now as every general

cognition may serve as the major in a syllogism and the understanding presents

us with such general  priori propositions they may be termed principles in

respect of their possible use




but if we consider these principles of the pure understanding in relation to

their origin we shall find them to be anything rather than cognitions from

conceptions for they would not even be possible  priori if we could not rely

on the assistance of pure intuition in mathematics or on that of the

conditions of a possible experience that everything that happens has a cause

cannot be concluded from the general conception of that which happens on the

contrary the principle of causality instructs us as to the mode of obtaining

from that which happens a determinate empirical conception




synthetical cognitions from conceptions the understanding cannot supply and

they alone are entitled to be called principles at the same time all general

propositions may be termed comparative principles




it has been a longcherished wishthat who knows how late may one day

be happily accomplishedthat the principles of the endless variety of

civil laws should be investigated and exposed for in this way alone can we

find the secret of simplifying legislation but in this case laws are nothing

more than limitations of our freedom upon conditions under which it subsists in

perfect harmony with itself they consequently have for their object that which

is completely our own work and of which we ourselves may be the cause by means

of these conceptions but how objects as things in themselveshow the

nature of things is subordinated to principles and is to be determined

according to conceptions is a question which it seems well nigh impossible to

answer be this however as it mayfor on this point our investigation

is yet to be madeit is at least manifest from what we have said that

cognition from principles is something very different from cognition by means

of the understanding which may indeed precede other cognitions in the form of

a principle but in itselfin so far as it is syntheticalis

neither based upon mere thought nor contains a general proposition drawn from

conceptions alone




the understanding may be a faculty for the production of unity of phenomena by

virtue of rules the reason is a faculty for the production of unity of rules

of the understanding under principles reason therefore never applies

directly to experience or to any sensuous object its object is on the

contrary the understanding to the manifold cognition of which it gives a

unity  priori by means of conceptionsa unity which may be called

rational unity and which is of a nature very different from that of the unity

produced by the understanding




the above is the general conception of the faculty of reason in so far as it

has been possible to make it comprehensible in the absence of examples these

will be given in the sequel




b of the logical use of reason




a distinction is commonly made between that which is immediately cognized and

that which is inferred or concluded that in a figure which is bounded by three

straight lines there are three angles is an immediate cognition but that

these angles are together equal to two right angles is an inference or

conclusion now as we are constantly employing this mode of thought and have

thus become quite accustomed to it we no longer remark the above distinction

and as in the case of the socalled deceptions of sense consider as

immediately perceived what has really been inferred in every reasoning or

syllogism there is a fundamental proposition afterwards a second drawn from

it and finally the conclusion which connects the truth in the first with the

truth in the secondand that infallibly if the judgement concluded is so

contained in the first proposition that it can be deduced from it without the

meditation of a third notion the conclusion is called immediate consequentia

immediata i prefer the term conclusion of the understanding but if in

addition to the fundamental cognition a second judgement is necessary for the

production of the conclusion it is called a conclusion of the reason in the

proposition all men are mortal are contained the propositions some men are

mortal nothing that is not mortal is a man and these are therefore immediate

conclusions from the first on the other hand the proposition all the learned

are mortal is not contained in the main proposition for the conception of a

learned man does not occur in it and it can be deduced from the main

proposition only by means of a mediating judgement




in every syllogism i first cogitate a rule the major by means of the

understanding in the next place i subsume a cognition under the condition of

the rule and this is the minor by means of the judgement and finally i

determine my cognition by means of the predicate of the rule this is the

conclusio consequently i determine it  priori by means of the reason the

relations therefore which the major proposition as the rule represents

between a cognition and its condition constitute the different kinds of

syllogisms these are just threefoldanalogously with all judgements in

so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of a cognition in

the understandingnamely categorical hypothetical and disjunctive




when as often happens the conclusion is a judgement which may follow from

other given judgements through which a perfectly different object is

cogitated i endeavour to discover in the understanding whether the assertion

in this conclusion does not stand under certain conditions according to a

general rule if i find such a condition and if the object mentioned in the

conclusion can be subsumed under the given condition then this conclusion

follows from a rule which is also valid for other objects of cognition from

this we see that reason endeavours to subject the great variety of the

cognitions of the understanding to the smallest possible number of principles

general conditions and thus to produce in it the highest unity




c of the pure use of reason




can we isolate reason and if so is it in this case a peculiar source of

conceptions and judgements which spring from it alone and through which it can

be applied to objects or is it merely a subordinate faculty whose duty it is

to give a certain form to given cognitionsa form which is called

logical and through which the cognitions of the understanding are subordinated

to each other and lower rules to higher those to wit whose condition

comprises in its sphere the condition of the others in so far as this can be

done by comparison this is the question which we have at present to answer

manifold variety of rules and unity of principles is a requirement of reason

for the purpose of bringing the understanding into complete accordance with

itself just as understanding subjects the manifold content of intuition to

conceptions and thereby introduces connection into it but this principle

prescribes no law to objects and does not contain any ground of the

possibility of cognizing or of determining them as such but is merely a

subjective law for the proper arrangement of the content of the understanding

the purpose of this law is by a comparison of the conceptions of the

understanding to reduce them to the smallest possible number although at the

same time it does not justify us in demanding from objects themselves such a

uniformity as might contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the

sphere of the understanding or in expecting that it will itself thus receive

from them objective validity in one word the question is does reason

in itself that is does pure reason contain  priori synthetical principles

and rules and what are those principles




the formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us sufficient

information in regard to the ground on which the transcendental principle of

reason in its pure synthetical cognition will rest




1 reason as observed in the syllogistic process is not applicable to

intuitions for the purpose of subjecting them to rulesfor this is the

province of the understanding with its categoriesbut to conceptions and

judgements if pure reason does apply to objects and the intuition of them it

does so not immediately but mediatelythrough the understanding and its

judgements which have a direct relation to the senses and their intuition for

the purpose of determining their objects the unity of reason is therefore not

the unity of a possible experience but is essentially different from this

unity which is that of the understanding that everything which happens has a

cause is not a principle cognized and prescribed by reason this principle

makes the unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason which

without a reference to possible experience could never have produced by means

of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity




2 reason in its logical use endeavours to discover the general condition of

its judgement the conclusion and a syllogism is itself nothing but a

judgement by means of the subsumption of its condition under a general rule

the major now as this rule may itself be subjected to the same process of

reason and thus the condition of the condition be sought by means of a

prosyllogism as long as the process can be continued it is very manifest that

the peculiar principle of reason in its logical use is to find for the

conditioned cognition of the understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity

of the former is completed




but this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason unless we admit

that if the conditioned is given the whole series of conditions subordinated

to one anothera series which is consequently itself

unconditionedis also given that is contained in the object and its

connection




but this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical for analytically

the conditioned certainly relates to some condition but not to the

unconditioned from this principle also there must originate different

synthetical propositions of which the pure understanding is perfectly

ignorant for it has to do only with objects of a possible experience the

cognition and synthesis of which is always conditioned the unconditioned if

it does really exist must be especially considered in regard to the

determinations which distinguish it from whatever is conditioned and will thus

afford us material for many  priori synthetical propositions




the principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason will

however be transcendent in relation to phenomena that is to say it will be

impossible to make any adequate empirical use of this principle it is

therefore completely different from all principles of the understanding the

use made of which is entirely immanent their object and purpose being merely

the possibility of experience now our duty in the transcendental dialectic is

as follows to discover whether the principle that the series of conditions in

the synthesis of phenomena or of thought in general extends to the

unconditioned is objectively true or not what consequences result therefrom

affecting the empirical use of the understanding or rather whether there

exists any such objectively valid proposition of reason and whether it is not

on the contrary a merely logical precept which directs us to ascend

perpetually to still higher conditions to approach completeness in the series

of them and thus to introduce into our cognition the highest possible unity of

reason we must ascertain i say whether this requirement of reason has not

been regarded by a misunderstanding as a transcendental principle of pure

reason which postulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions in

objects themselves we must show moreover the misconceptions and illusions

that intrude into syllogisms the major proposition of which pure reason has

supplieda proposition which has perhaps more of the character of a

petitio than of a postulatumand that proceed from experience upwards to

its conditions the solution of these problems is our task in transcendental

dialectic which we are about to expose even at its source that lies deep in

human reason we shall divide it into two parts the first of which will treat

of the transcendent conceptions of pure reason the second of transcendent and

dialectical syllogisms


transcendental dialecticbook iof the

conceptions of pure reason


the conceptions of pure reasonwe do not here speak of the possibility of

themare not obtained by reflection but by inference or conclusion the

conceptions of understanding are also cogitated  priori antecedently to

experience and render it possible but they contain nothing but the unity of

reflection upon phenomena in so far as these must necessarily belong to a

possible empirical consciousness through them alone are cognition and the

determination of an object possible it is from them accordingly that we

receive material for reasoning and antecedently to them we possess no  priori

conceptions of objects from which they might be deduced on the other hand the

sole basis of their objective reality consists in the necessity imposed on

them as containing the intellectual form of all experience of restricting

their application and influence to the sphere of experience




but the term conception of reason or rational conception itself indicates

that it does not confine itself within the limits of experience because its

objectmatter is a cognition of which every empirical cognition is but a

partnay the whole of possible experience may be itself but a part of

ita cognition to which no actual experience ever fully attains although

it does always pertain to it the aim of rational conceptions is the

comprehension as that of the conceptions of understanding is the understanding

of perceptions if they contain the unconditioned they relate to that to which

all experience is subordinate but which is never itself an object of

experiencethat towards which reason tends in all its conclusions from

experience and by the standard of which it estimates the degree of their

empirical use but which is never itself an element in an empirical synthesis

if notwithstanding such conceptions possess objective validity they may be

called conceptus ratiocinati conceptions legitimately concluded in cases

where they do not they have been admitted on account of having the appearance

of being correctly concluded and may be called conceptus ratiocinantes

sophistical conceptions but as this can only be sufficiently demonstrated in

that part of our treatise which relates to the dialectical conclusions of

reason we shall omit any consideration of it in this place as we called the

pure conceptions of the understanding categories we shall also distinguish

those of pure reason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas these

terms however we must in the first place explain and justify


section iof ideas in general


despite the great wealth of words which european languages possess the thinker

finds himself often at a loss for an expression exactly suited to his

conception for want of which he is unable to make himself intelligible either

to others or to himself to coin new words is a pretension to legislation in

language which is seldom successful and before recourse is taken to so

desperate an expedient it is advisable to examine the dead and learned

languages with the hope and the probability that we may there meet with some

adequate expression of the notion we have in our minds in this case even if

the original meaning of the word has become somewhat uncertain from

carelessness or want of caution on the part of the authors of it it is always

better to adhere to and confirm its proper meaningeven although it may

be doubtful whether it was formerly used in exactly this sensethan to

make our labour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselves

intelligible




for this reason when it happens that there exists only a single word to

express a certain conception and this word in its usual acceptation is

thoroughly adequate to the conception the accurate distinction of which from

related conceptions is of great importance we ought not to employ the

expression improvidently or for the sake of variety and elegance of style

use it as a synonym for other cognate words it is our duty on the contrary

carefully to preserve its peculiar signification as otherwise it easily

happens that when the attention of the reader is no longer particularly

attracted to the expression and it is lost amid the multitude of other words

of very different import the thought which it conveyed and which it alone

conveyed is lost with it




plato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed he meant by it

something which is never derived from the senses but which far transcends even

the conceptions of the understanding with which aristotle occupied himself

inasmuch as in experience nothing perfectly corresponding to them could be

found ideas are according to him archetypes of things themselves and not

merely keys to possible experiences like the categories in his view they flow

from the highest reason by which they have been imparted to human reason

which however exists no longer in its original state but is obliged with

great labour to recall by reminiscencewhich is called

philosophythe old but now sadly obscured ideas i will not here enter

upon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublime philosopher

attached to this expression i shall content myself with remarking that it is

nothing unusual in common conversation as well as in written works by

comparing the thoughts which an author has delivered upon a subject to

understand him better than he understood himself inasmuch as he may not have

sufficiently determined his conception and thus have sometimes spoken nay

even thought in opposition to his own opinions




plato perceived very clearly that our faculty of cognition has the feeling of a

much higher vocation than that of merely spelling out phenomena according to

synthetical unity for the purpose of being able to read them as experience

and that our reason naturally raises itself to cognitions far too elevated to

admit of the possibility of an object given by experience corresponding to

themcognitions which are nevertheless real and are not mere phantoms of

the brain




this philosopher found his ideas especially in all that is practical41 that is which rests upon freedom

which in its turn ranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of

reason he who would derive from experience the conceptions of virtue who

would make as many have really done that which at best can but serve as an

imperfectly illustrative example a model for or the formation of a perfectly

adequate idea on the subject would in fact transform virtue into a nonentity

changeable according to time and circumstance and utterly incapable of being

employed as a rule on the contrary every one is conscious that when any one

is held up to him as a model of virtue he compares this socalled model with

the true original which he possesses in his own mind and values him according

to this standard but this standard is the idea of virtue in relation to which

all possible objects of experience are indeed serviceable as

examplesproofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that which

the conception of virtue demandsbut certainly not as archetypes that

the actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all the

requirements of the pure ideas of reason does not prove the thought to be

chimerical for only through this idea are all judgements as to moral merit or

demerit possible it consequently lies at the foundation of every approach to

moral perfection however far removed from it the obstacles in human

natureindeterminable as to degreemay keep us



 41

he certainly extended the application of his conception to speculative

cognitions also provided they were given pure and completely  priori nay

even to mathematics although this science cannot possess an object otherwhere

than in possible experience i cannot follow him in this and as little can i

follow him in his mystical deduction of these ideas or in his hypostatization

of them although in truth the elevated and exaggerated language which he

employed in describing them is quite capable of an interpretation more subdued

and more in accordance with fact and the nature of things




the platonic republic has become proverbial as an exampleand a striking

oneof imaginary perfection such as can exist only in the brain of the

idle thinker and brucker ridicules the philosopher for maintaining that a

prince can never govern well unless he is participant in the ideas but we

should do better to follow up this thought and where this admirable thinker

leaves us without assistance employ new efforts to place it in clearer light

rather than carelessly fling it aside as useless under the very miserable and

pernicious pretext of impracticability a constitution of the greatest possible

human freedom according to laws by which the liberty of every individual can

consist with the liberty of every other not of the greatest possible

happiness for this follows necessarily from the former is to say the least

a necessary idea which must be placed at the foundation not only of the first

plan of the constitution of a state but of all its laws and in this it not

necessary at the outset to take account of the obstacles which lie in our

wayobstacles which perhaps do not necessarily arise from the character

of human nature but rather from the previous neglect of true ideas in

legislation for there is nothing more pernicious and more unworthy of a

philosopher than the vulgar appeal to a socalled adverse experience which

indeed would not have existed if those institutions had been established at

the proper time and in accordance with ideas while instead of this

conceptions crude for the very reason that they have been drawn from

experience have marred and frustrated all our better views and intentions the

more legislation and government are in harmony with this idea the more rare do

punishments become and thus it is quite reasonable to maintain as plato did

that in a perfect state no punishments at all would be necessary now although

a perfect state may never exist the idea is not on that account the less just

which holds up this maximum as the archetype or standard of a constitution in

order to bring legislative government always nearer and nearer to the greatest

possible perfection for at what precise degree human nature must stop in its

progress and how wide must be the chasm which must necessarily exist between

the idea and its realization are problems which no one can or ought to

determineand for this reason that it is the destination of freedom to

overstep all assigned limits between itself and the idea




but not only in that wherein human reason is a real causal agent and where

ideas are operative causes of actions and their objects that is to say in

the region of ethics but also in regard to nature herself plato saw clear

proofs of an origin from ideas a plant and animal the regular order of

natureprobably also the disposition of the whole universegive

manifest evidence that they are possible only by means of and according to

ideas that indeed no one creature under the individual conditions of its

existence perfectly harmonizes with the idea of the most perfect of its

kindjust as little as man with the idea of humanity which nevertheless

he bears in his soul as the archetypal standard of his actions that

notwithstanding these ideas are in the highest sense individually

unchangeably and completely determined and are the original causes of things

and that the totality of connected objects in the universe is alone fully

adequate to that idea setting aside the exaggerations of expression in the

writings of this philosopher the mental power exhibited in this ascent from

the ectypal mode of regarding the physical world to the architectonic

connection thereof according to ends that is ideas is an effort which

deserves imitation and claims respect but as regards the principles of ethics

of legislation and of religion spheres in which ideas alone render experience

possible although they never attain to full expression therein he has

vindicated for himself a position of peculiar merit which is not appreciated

only because it is judged by the very empirical rules the validity of which as

principles is destroyed by ideas for as regards nature experience presents us

with rules and is the source of truth but in relation to ethical laws

experience is the parent of illusion and it is in the highest degree

reprehensible to limit or to deduce the laws which dictate what i ought to do

from what is done




we must however omit the consideration of these important subjects the

development of which is in reality the peculiar duty and dignity of philosophy

and confine ourselves for the present to the more humble but not less useful

task of preparing a firm foundation for those majestic edifices of moral

science for this foundation has been hitherto insecure from the many

subterranean passages which reason in its confident but vain search for

treasures has made in all directions our present duty is to make ourselves

perfectly acquainted with the transcendental use made of pure reason its

principles and ideas that we may be able properly to determine and value its

influence and real worth but before bringing these introductory remarks to a

close i beg those who really have philosophy at heartand their number

is but smallif they shall find themselves convinced by the

considerations following as well as by those above to exert themselves to

preserve to the expression idea its original signification and to take care

that it be not lost among those other expressions by which all sorts of

representations are loosely designatedthat the interests of science may

not thereby suffer we are in no want of words to denominate adequately every

mode of representation without the necessity of encroaching upon terms which

are proper to others the following is a graduated list of them the genus is

representation in general representatio under it stands representation with

consciousness perceptio a perception which relates solely to the subject as

a modification of its state is a sensation sensatio an objective perception

is a cognition cognitio a cognition is either an intuition or a conception

intuitus vel conceptus the former has an immediate relation to the object

and is singular and individual the latter has but a mediate relation by means

of a characteristic mark which may be common to several things a conception is

either empirical or pure a pure conception in so far as it has its origin in

the understanding alone and is not the conception of a pure sensuous image is

called notio a conception formed from notions which transcends the

possibility of experience is an idea or a conception of reason to one who

has accustomed himself to these distinctions it must be quite intolerable to

hear the representation of the colour red called an idea it ought not even to

be called a notion or conception of understanding


section ii of transcendental ideas


transcendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of our cognition

can contain the origin of pure conceptions  priori conceptions which

represent objects antecedently to all experience or rather indicate the

synthetical unity which alone renders possible an empirical cognition of

objects the form of judgementsconverted into a conception of the

synthesis of intuitionsproduced the categories which direct the

employment of the understanding in experience this consideration warrants us

to expect that the form of syllogisms when applied to synthetical unity of

intuitions following the rule of the categories will contain the origin of

particular  priori conceptions which we may call pure conceptions of reason

or transcendental ideas and which will determine the use of the understanding

in the totality of experience according to principles




the function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a cognition

according to conceptions and the syllogism itself is a judgement which is

determined  priori in the whole extent of its condition the proposition

caius is mortal is one which may be obtained from experience by

the aid of the understanding alone but my wish is to find a conception which

contains the condition under which the predicate of this judgement is

givenin this case the conception of manand after subsuming under

this condition taken in its whole extent all men are mortal i determine

according to it the cognition of the object thought and say caius is

mortal




hence in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a certain

object after having thought it in the major in its whole extent under a

certain condition this complete quantity of the extent in relation to such a

condition is called universality universalitas to this corresponds totality

universitas of conditions in the synthesis of intuitions the transcendental

conception of reason is therefore nothing else than the conception of the

totality of the conditions of a given conditioned now as the unconditioned

alone renders possible totality of conditions and conversely the totality of

conditions is itself always unconditioned a pure rational conception in

general can be defined and explained by means of the conception of the

unconditioned in so far as it contains a basis for the synthesis of the

conditioned




to the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates by means

of the categories the number of pure rational conceptions will correspond we

must therefore seek for first an unconditioned of the categorical synthesis

in a subject secondly of the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a

series thirdly of the disjunctive synthesis of parts in a system




there are exactly the same number of modes of syllogisms each of which

proceeds through prosyllogisms to the unconditionedone to the subject

which cannot be employed as predicate another to the presupposition which

supposes nothing higher than itself and the third to an aggregate of the

members of the complete division of a conception hence the pure rational

conceptions of totality in the synthesis of conditions have a necessary

foundation in the nature of human reasonat least as modes of elevating

the unity of the understanding to the unconditioned they may have no valid

application corresponding to their transcendental employment in concreto and

be thus of no greater utility than to direct the understanding how while

extending them as widely as possible to maintain its exercise and application

in perfect consistence and harmony




but while speaking here of the totality of conditions and of the unconditioned

as the common title of all conceptions of reason we again light upon an

expression which we find it impossible to dispense with and which

nevertheless owing to the ambiguity attaching to it from long abuse we cannot

employ with safety the word absolute is one of the few words which in its

original signification was perfectly adequate to the conception it was

intended to conveya conception which no other word in the same language

exactly suits and the lossor which is the same thing the incautious

and loose employmentof which must be followed by the loss of the

conception itself and as it is a conception which occupies much of the

attention of reason its loss would be greatly to the detriment of all

transcendental philosophy the word absolute is at present frequently used to

denote that something can be predicated of a thing considered in itself and

intrinsically in this sense absolutely possible would signify that which is

possible in itself internewhich is in fact the least that one can

predicate of an object on the other hand it is sometimes employed to indicate

that a thing is valid in all respectsfor example absolute sovereignty

absolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possible in all

relations and in every respect and this is the most that can be predicated of

the possibility of a thing now these significations do in truth frequently

coincide thus for example that which is intrinsically impossible is also

impossible in all relations that is absolutely impossible but in most cases

they differ from each other toto caelo and i can by no means conclude that

because a thing is in itself possible it is also possible in all relations

and therefore absolutely nay more i shall in the sequel show that absolute

necessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity and that

therefore it must not be considered as synonymous with it of an opposite

which is intrinsically impossible we may affirm that it is in all respects

impossible and that consequently the thing itself of which this is the

opposite is absolutely necessary but i cannot reason conversely and say the

opposite of that which is absolutely necessary is intrinsically impossible

that is that the absolute necessity of things is an internal necessity for

this internal necessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the

least conception cannot be connected while the conception of the necessity of

a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations now as the

loss of a conception of great utility in speculative science cannot be a matter

of indifference to the philosopher i trust that the proper determination and

careful preservation of the expression on which the conception depends will

likewise be not indifferent to him




in this enlarged signification then shall i employ the word absolute in

opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect for the

latter is restricted by conditions the former is valid without any restriction

whatever




now the transcendental conception of reason has for its object nothing else

than absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions and does not rest

satisfied till it has attained to the absolutely that is in all respects and

relations unconditioned for pure reason leaves to the understanding

everything that immediately relates to the object of intuition or rather to

their synthesis in imagination the former restricts itself to the absolute

totality in the employment of the conceptions of the understanding and aims at

carrying out the synthetical unity which is cogitated in the category even to

the unconditioned this unity may hence be called the rational unity of

phenomena as the other which the category expresses may be termed the unity

of the understanding reason therefore has an immediate relation to the use

of the understanding not indeed in so far as the latter contains the ground of

possible experience for the conception of the absolute totality of conditions

is not a conception that can be employed in experience because no experience

is unconditioned but solely for the purpose of directing it to a certain

unity of which the understanding has no conception and the aim of which is to

collect into an absolute whole all acts of the understanding hence the

objective employment of the pure conceptions of reason is always transcendent

while that of the pure conceptions of the understanding must according to

their nature be always immanent inasmuch as they are limited to possible

experience




i understand by idea a necessary conception of reason to which no

corresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense accordingly the

pure conceptions of reason at present under consideration are transcendental

ideas they are conceptions of pure reason for they regard all empirical

cognition as determined by means of an absolute totality of conditions they

are not mere fictions but natural and necessary products of reason and have

hence a necessary relation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the

understanding and finally they are transcendent and overstep the limits of

all experiences in which consequently no object can ever be presented that

would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea when we use the word

idea we say as regards its object an object of the pure understanding a

great deal but as regards its subject that is in respect of its reality

under conditions of experience exceedingly little because the idea as the

conception of a maximum can never be completely and adequately presented in

concreto now as in the merely speculative employment of reason the latter is

properly the sole aim and as in this case the approximation to a conception

which is never attained in practice is the same thing as if the conception

were nonexistentit is commonly said of the conception of this kind

it is only an idea so we might very well say the

absolute totality of all phenomena is only an idea for as we never can

present an adequate representation of it it remains for us a problem incapable

of solution on the other hand as in the practical use of the understanding we

have only to do with action and practice according to rules an idea of pure

reason can always be given really in concreto although only partially nay it

is the indispensable condition of all practical employment of reason the

practice or execution of the idea is always limited and defective but

nevertheless within indeterminable boundaries consequently always under the

influence of the conception of an absolute perfection and thus the practical

idea is always in the highest degree fruitful and in relation to real actions

indispensably necessary in the idea pure reason possesses even causality and

the power of producing that which its conception contains hence we cannot say

of wisdom in a disparaging way it is only an idea for for the

very reason that it is the idea of the necessary unity of all possible aims it

must be for all practical exertions and endeavours the primitive condition and

rulea rule which if not constitutive is at least limitative




now although we must say of the transcendental conceptions of reason

they are only ideas we must not on this account look upon them

as superfluous and nugatory for although no object can be determined by them

they can be of great utility unobserved and at the basis of the edifice of the

understanding as the canon for its extended and selfconsistent

exercisea canon which indeed does not enable it to cognize more in an

object than it would cognize by the help of its own conceptions but which

guides it more securely in its cognition not to mention that they perhaps

render possible a transition from our conceptions of nature and the nonego to

the practical conceptions and thus produce for even ethical ideas keeping so

to speak and connection with the speculative cognitions of reason the

explication of all this must be looked for in the sequel




but setting aside in conformity with our original purpose the consideration

of the practical ideas we proceed to contemplate reason in its speculative use

alone nay in a still more restricted sphere to wit in the transcendental

use and here must strike into the same path which we followed in our deduction

of the categories that is to say we shall consider the logical form of the

cognition of reason that we may see whether reason may not be thereby a source

of conceptions which enables us to regard objects in themselves as determined

synthetically  priori in relation to one or other of the functions of reason




reason considered as the faculty of a certain logical form of cognition is

the faculty of conclusion that is of mediate judgementby means of the

subsumption of the condition of a possible judgement under the condition of a

given judgement the given judgement is the general rule major the

subsumption of the condition of another possible judgement under the condition

of the rule is the minor the actual judgement which enounces the assertion of

the rule in the subsumed case is the conclusion conclusio the rule

predicates something generally under a certain condition the condition of the

rule is satisfied in some particular case it follows that what was valid in

general under that condition must also be considered as valid in the particular

case which satisfies this condition it is very plain that reason attains to a

cognition by means of acts of the understanding which constitute a series of

conditions when i arrive at the proposition all bodies are

changeable by beginning with the more remote cognition in which the

conception of body does not appear but which nevertheless contains the

condition of that conception all compound is changeable by

proceeding from this to a less remote cognition which stands under the

condition of the former bodies are compound and hence to a

third which at length connects for me the remote cognition changeable with

the one before me consequently bodies are changeablei

have arrived at a cognition conclusion through a series of conditions

premisses now every series whose exponent of the categorical or

hypothetical judgement is given can be continued consequently the same

procedure of reason conducts us to the ratiocinatio polysyllogistica which is

a series of syllogisms that can be continued either on the side of the

conditions per prosyllogismos or of the conditioned per episyllogismos to

an indefinite extent




but we very soon perceive that the chain or series of prosyllogisms that is

of deduced cognitions on the side of the grounds or conditions of a given

cognition in other words the ascending series of syllogisms must have a very

different relation to the faculty of reason from that of the descending series

that is the progressive procedure of reason on the side of the conditioned by

means of episyllogisms for as in the former case the cognition conclusio is

given only as conditioned reason can attain to this cognition only under the

presupposition that all the members of the series on the side of the conditions

are given totality in the series of premisses because only under this

supposition is the judgement we may be considering possible  priori while on

the side of the conditioned or the inferences only an incomplete and becoming

and not a presupposed or given series consequently only a potential

progression is cogitated hence when a cognition is contemplated as

conditioned reason is compelled to consider the series of conditions in an

ascending line as completed and given in their totality but if the very same

condition is considered at the same time as the condition of other cognitions

which together constitute a series of inferences or consequences in a

descending line reason may preserve a perfect indifference as to how far this

progression may extend a parte posteriori and whether the totality of

this series is possible because it stands in no need of such a series for the

purpose of arriving at the conclusion before it inasmuch as this conclusion is

sufficiently guaranteed and determined on grounds a parte priori it may be the

case that upon the side of the conditions the series of premisses has a first

or highest condition or it may not possess this and so be a parte priori

unlimited but it must nevertheless contain totality of conditions even

admitting that we never could succeed in completely apprehending it and the

whole series must be unconditionally true if the conditioned which is

considered as an inference resulting from it is to be held as true this is a

requirement of reason which announces its cognition as determined  priori and

as necessary either in itselfand in this case it needs no grounds to

rest uponor if it is deduced as a member of a series of grounds which

is itself unconditionally true


section iii system of transcendental ideas


we are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic which makes complete

abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only at unveiling the illusory

appearance in the form of syllogisms our subject is transcendental dialectic

which must contain completely  priori the origin of certain cognitions drawn

from pure reason and the origin of certain deduced conceptions the object of

which cannot be given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of

the faculty of understanding we have observed from the natural relation which

the transcendental use of our cognition in syllogisms as well as in

judgements must have to the logical that there are three kinds of dialectical

arguments corresponding to the three modes of conclusion by which reason

attains to cognitions on principles and that in all it is the business of

reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis beyond which the understanding

never proceeds to the unconditioned which the understanding never can reach




now the most general relations which can exist in our representations are 1st

the relation to the subject 2nd the relation to objects either as phenomena

or as objects of thought in general if we connect this subdivision with the

main division all the relations of our representations of which we can form

either a conception or an idea are threefold 1 the relation to the subject

2 the relation to the manifold of the object as a phenomenon 3 the relation

to all things in general




now all pure conceptions have to do in general with the synthetical unity of

representations conceptions of pure reason transcendental ideas on the

other hand with the unconditional synthetical unity of all conditions it

follows that all transcendental ideas arrange themselves in three classes the

first of which contains the absolute unconditioned unity of the thinking

subject the second the absolute unity of the series of the conditions of a

phenomenon the third the absolute unity of the condition of all objects of

thought in general




the thinking subject is the objectmatter of psychology the sum total of all

phenomena the world is the objectmatter of cosmology and the thing which

contains the highest condition of the possibility of all that is cogitable the

being of all beings is the objectmatter of all theology thus pure reason

presents us with the idea of a transcendental doctrine of the soul psychologia

rationalis of a transcendental science of the world cosmologia rationalis

and finally of a transcendental doctrine of god theologia transcendentalis

understanding cannot originate even the outline of any of these sciences even

when connected with the highest logical use of reason that is all cogitable

syllogismsfor the purpose of proceeding from one object phenomenon to

all others even to the utmost limits of the empirical synthesis they are on

the contrary pure and genuine products or problems of pure reason




what modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideas are will

be fully exposed in the following chapter they follow the guiding thread of

the categories for pure reason never relates immediately to objects but to

the conceptions of these contained in the understanding in like manner it

will be made manifest in the detailed explanation of these ideashow

reason merely through the synthetical use of the same function which it

employs in a categorical syllogism necessarily attains to the conception of

the absolute unity of the thinking subjecthow the logical procedure in

hypothetical ideas necessarily produces the idea of the absolutely

unconditioned in a series of given conditions and finallyhow the mere

form of the disjunctive syllogism involves the highest conception of a being of

all beings a thought which at first sight seems in the highest degree

paradoxical




an objective deduction such as we were able to present in the case of the

categories is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas for they have

in truth no relation to any object in experience for the very reason that

they are only ideas but a subjective deduction of them from the nature of our

reason is possible and has been given in the present chapter




it is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolute

totality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions and that it does not

concern itself with the absolute completeness on the part of the conditioned

for of the former alone does she stand in need in order to preposit the whole

series of conditions and thus present them to the understanding  priori but

if we once have a completely and unconditionally given condition there is no

further necessity in proceeding with the series for a conception of reason

for the understanding takes of itself every step downward from the condition

to the conditioned thus the transcendental ideas are available only for

ascending in the series of conditions till we reach the unconditioned that

is principles as regards descending to the conditioned on the other hand we

find that there is a widely extensive logical use which reason makes of the

laws of the understanding but that a transcendental use thereof is impossible

and that when we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis for

example of the whole series of all future changes in the world this idea is a

mere ens rationis an arbitrary fiction of thought and not a necessary

presupposition of reason for the possibility of the conditioned presupposes

the totality of its conditions but not of its consequences consequently this

conception is not a transcendental ideaand it is with these alone that

we are at present occupied




finally it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideas a

certain connection and unity and that pure reason by means of them collects

all its cognitions into one system from the cognition of self to the cognition

of the world and through these to the supreme being the progression is so

natural that it seems to resemble the logical march of reason from the

premisses to the conclusion42 now whether there lies unobserved at

the foundation of these ideas an analogy of the same kind as exists between the

logical and transcendental procedure of reason is another of those questions

the answer to which we must not expect till we arrive at a more advanced stage

in our inquiries in this cursory and preliminary view we have meanwhile

reached our aim for we have dispelled the ambiguity which attached to the

transcendental conceptions of reason from their being commonly mixed up with

other conceptions in the systems of philosophers and not properly

distinguished from the conceptions of the understanding we have exposed their

origin and thereby at the same time their determinate number and presented

them in a systematic connection and have thus marked out and enclosed a

definite sphere for pure reason



 42

the science of metaphysics has for the proper object of its inquiries only

three grand ideas god freedom and immortality and it aims at showing that

the second conception conjoined with the first must lead to the third as a

necessary conclusion all the other subjects with which it occupies itself are

merely means for the attainment and realization of these ideas it does not

require these ideas for the construction of a science of nature but on the

contrary for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature a complete

insight into and comprehension of them would render theology ethics and

through the conjunction of both religion solely dependent on the speculative

faculty of reason in a systematic representation of these ideas the

abovementioned arrangementthe synthetical onewould be the most

suitable but in the investigation which must necessarily precede it the

analytical which reverses this arrangement would be better adapted to our

purpose as in it we should proceed from that which experience immediately

presents to uspsychology to cosmology and thence to theology


transcendental dialecticbook iiof the

dialectical procedure of pure reason


it may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is something of

which we have no conception although the idea may be a necessary product of

reason according to its original laws for in fact a conception of an object

that is adequate to the idea given by reason is impossible for such an object

must be capable of being presented and intuited in a possible experience but

we should express our meaning better and with less risk of being

misunderstood if we said that we can have no knowledge of an object which

perfectly corresponds to an idea although we may possess a problematical

conception thereof




now the transcendental subjective reality at least of the pure conceptions of

reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideas by a necessary

procedure of reason there must therefore be syllogisms which contain no

empirical premisses and by means of which we conclude from something that we

do know to something of which we do not even possess a conception to which

we nevertheless by an unavoidable illusion ascribe objective reality such

arguments are as regards their result rather to be termed sophisms than

syllogisms although indeed as regards their origin they are very well

entitled to the latter name inasmuch as they are not fictions or accidental

products of reason but are necessitated by its very nature they are sophisms

not of men but of pure reason herself from which the wisest cannot free

himself after long labour he may be able to guard against the error but he

can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion which continually mocks and

misleads him




of these dialectical arguments there are three kinds corresponding to the

number of the ideas which their conclusions present in the argument or

syllogism of the first class i conclude from the transcendental conception of

the subject contains no manifold the absolute unity of the subject itself of

which i cannot in this manner attain to a conception this dialectical argument

i shall call the transcendental paralogism the second class of sophistical

arguments is occupied with the transcendental conception of the absolute

totality of the series of conditions for a given phenomenon and i conclude

from the fact that i have always a selfcontradictory conception of the

unconditioned synthetical unity of the series upon one side the truth of the

opposite unity of which i have nevertheless no conception the condition of

reason in these dialectical arguments i shall term the antinomy of pure

reason finally according to the third kind of sophistical argument i

conclude from the totality of the conditions of thinking objects in general

in so far as they can be given the absolute synthetical unity of all

conditions of the possibility of things in general that is from things which

i do not know in their mere transcendental conception i conclude a being of

all beings which i know still less by means of a transcendental conception and

of whose unconditioned necessity i can form no conception whatever this

dialectical argument i shall call the ideal of pure reason


chapter i of the paralogisms of pure reason


the logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument in respect of its

form be the content what it may but a transcendental paralogism has a

transcendental foundation and concludes falsely while the form is correct and

unexceptionable in this manner the paralogism has its foundation in the nature

of human reason and is the parent of an unavoidable though not insoluble

mental illusion




we now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general list of

transcendental conceptions and yet must be reckoned with them but at the same

time without in the least altering or indicating a deficiency in that table

this is the conception or if the term is preferred the judgement i

think but it is readily perceived that this thought is as it were the

vehicle of all conceptions in general and consequently of transcendental

conceptions also and that it is therefore regarded as a transcendental

conception although it can have no peculiar claim to be so ranked inasmuch as

its only use is to indicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness

at the same time pure as this conception is from empirical content

impressions of the senses it enables us to distinguish two different kinds

of objects i as thinking am an object of the internal sense

and am called soul that which is an object of the external senses is called

body thus the expression i as a thinking being designates the

objectmatter of psychology which may be called the rational doctrine

of the soul inasmuch as in this science i desire to know nothing of the

soul but what independently of all experience which determines me in

concreto may be concluded from this conception i in so far as

it appears in all thought




now the rational doctrine of the soul is really an undertaking of this kind

for if the smallest empirical element of thought if any particular perception

of my internal state were to be introduced among the grounds of cognition of

this science it would not be a rational but an empirical doctrine of the

soul we have thus before us a pretended science raised upon the single

proposition i think whose foundation or want of foundation we

may very properly and agreeably with the nature of a transcendental

philosophy here examine it ought not to be objected that in this proposition

which expresses the perception of ones self an internal experience is

asserted and that consequently the rational doctrine of the soul which is

founded upon it is not pure but partly founded upon an empirical principle

for this internal perception is nothing more than the mere apperception

i think which in fact renders all transcendental conceptions

possible in which we say i think substance cause etc for

internal experience in general and its possibility or perception in general

and its relation to other perceptions unless some particular distinction or

determination thereof is empirically given cannot be regarded as empirical

cognition but as cognition of the empirical and belongs to the investigation

of the possibility of every experience which is certainly transcendental the

smallest object of experience for example only pleasure or pain that should

be included in the general representation of selfconsciousness would

immediately change the rational into an empirical psychology




i think is therefore the only text of rational psychology from

which it must develop its whole system it is manifest that this thought when

applied to an object myself can contain nothing but transcendental

predicates thereof because the least empirical predicate would destroy the

purity of the science and its independence of all experience




but we shall have to follow here the guidance of the categoriesonly as

in the present case a thing i as thinking being is at first

given we shallnot indeed change the order of the categories as it

stands in the tablebut begin at the category of substance by which at

the a thing in itself is represented and proceeds backwards through the series

the topic of the rational doctrine of the soul from which everything else it

may contain must be deduced is accordingly as follows




            1                          2

  the soul is substance       as regards its quality

                                it is simple



                      3

          as regards the different

          times in which it exists

          it is numerically identical

          that is unity not plurality



                       4

  it is in relation to possible objects in space43



 43

the reader who may not so easily perceive the psychological sense of these

expressions taken here in their transcendental abstraction and cannot guess

why the latter attribute of the soul belongs to the category of existence will

find the expressions sufficiently explained and justified in the sequel i

have moreover to apologize for the latin terms which have been employed

instead of their german synonyms contrary to the rules of correct writing but

i judged it better to sacrifice elegance to perspicuity




from these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology by

combination alone without the aid of any other principle this substance

merely as an object of the internal sense gives the conception of

immateriality as simple substance that of incorruptibility its identity as

intellectual substance gives the conception of personality all these three

together spirituality its relation to objects in space gives us the

conception of connection commercium with bodies thus it represents thinking

substance as the principle of life in matter that is as a soul anima and

as the ground of animality and this limited and determined by the conception

of spirituality gives us that of immortality




now to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendental

psychology which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason touching the

nature of our thinking being we can however lay at the foundation of this

science nothing but the simple and in itself perfectly contentless

representation i which cannot even be called a conception but

merely a consciousness which accompanies all conceptions by this

i or he or it who or which thinks

nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought  x which

is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are its predicates and of

which apart from these we cannot form the least conception hence in a

perpetual circle inasmuch as we must always employ it in order to frame any

judgement respecting it and this inconvenience we find it impossible to rid

ourselves of because consciousness in itself is not so much a representation

distinguishing a particular object as a form of representation in general in

so far as it may be termed cognition for in and by cognition alone do i think

anything




it must however appear extraordinary at first sight that the condition under

which i think and which is consequently a property of my subject should be

held to be likewise valid for every existence which thinks and that we can

presume to base upon a seemingly empirical proposition a judgement which is

apodeictic and universal to wit that everything which thinks is constituted

as the voice of my consciousness declares it to be that is as a

selfconscious being the cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that

we necessarily attribute to things  priori all the properties which constitute

conditions under which alone we can cogitate them now i cannot obtain the

least representation of a thinking being by means of external experience but

solely through selfconsciousness such objects are consequently nothing more

than the transference of this consciousness of mine to other things which can

only thus be represented as thinking beings the proposition i

think is in the present case understood in a problematical sense not

in so far as it contains a perception of an existence like the cartesian

cogito ergo sum but in regard to its mere

possibilityfor the purpose of discovering what properties may be

inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subject of it




if at the foundation of our pure rational cognition of thinking beings there

lay more than the mere cogitoif we could likewise call in aid

observations on the play of our thoughts and the thence derived natural laws

of the thinking self there would arise an empirical psychology which would be

a kind of physiology of the internal sense and might possibly be capable of

explaining the phenomena of that sense but it could never be available for

discovering those properties which do not belong to possible experience such

as the quality of simplicity nor could it make any apodeictic enunciation on

the nature of thinking beings it would therefore not be a rational psychology




now as the proposition i think in the problematical sense

contains the form of every judgement in general and is the constant

accompaniment of all the categories it is manifest that conclusions are drawn

from it only by a transcendental employment of the understanding this use of

the understanding excludes all empirical elements and we cannot as has been

shown above have any favourable conception beforehand of its procedure we

shall therefore follow with a critical eye this proposition through all the

predicaments of pure psychology but we shall for brevitys sake allow

this examination to proceed in an uninterrupted connection




before entering on this task however the following general remark may help to

quicken our attention to this mode of argument it is not merely through my

thinking that i cognize an object but only through my determining a given

intuition in relation to the unity of consciousness in which all thinking

consists it follows that i cognize myself not through my being conscious of

myself as thinking but only when i am conscious of the intuition of myself as

determined in relation to the function of thought all the modi of

selfconsciousness in thought are hence not conceptions of objects conceptions

of the understandingcategories they are mere logical functions which

do not present to thought an object to be cognized and cannot therefore

present my self as an object not the consciousness of the determining but

only that of the determinable self that is of my internal intuition in so

far as the manifold contained in it can be connected conformably with the

general condition of the unity of apperception in thought is the object




1 in all judgements i am the determining subject of that relation which

constitutes a judgement but that the i which thinks must be considered as in

thought always a subject and as a thing which cannot be a predicate to

thought is an apodeictic and identical proposition but this proposition does

not signify that i as an object am for myself a selfsubsistent being or

substance this latter statementan ambitious onerequires to be

supported by data which are not to be discovered in thought and are perhaps

in so far as i consider the thinking self merely as such not to be discovered

in the thinking self at all




2 that the i or ego of apperception and consequently in all thought is

singular or simple and cannot be resolved into a plurality of subjects and

therefore indicates a logically simple subjectthis is selfevident from

the very conception of an ego and is consequently an analytical proposition

but this is not tantamount to declaring that the thinking ego is a simple

substancefor this would be a synthetical proposition the conception of

substance always relates to intuitions which with me cannot be other than

sensuous and which consequently lie completely out of the sphere of the

understanding and its thought but to this sphere belongs the affirmation that

the ego is simple in thought it would indeed be surprising if the conception

of substance which in other cases requires so much labour to

distinguish from the other elements presented by intuitionso much

trouble too to discover whether it can be simple as in the case of the parts

of mattershould be presented immediately to me as if by revelation in

the poorest mental representation of all




3 the proposition of the identity of my self amidst all the manifold

representations of which i am conscious is likewise a proposition lying in the

conceptions themselves and is consequently analytical but this identity of

the subject of which i am conscious in all its representations does not

relate to or concern the intuition of the subject by which it is given as an

object this proposition cannot therefore enounce the identity of the person

by which is understood the consciousness of the identity of its own substance

as a thinking being in all change and variation of circumstances to prove

this we should require not a mere analysis of the proposition but synthetical

judgements based upon a given intuition




4 i distinguish my own existence as that of a thinking being from that of

other things external to meamong which my body also is reckoned this is

also an analytical proposition for other things are exactly those which i

think as different or distinguished from myself but whether this consciousness

of myself is possible without things external to me and whether therefore i

can exist merely as a thinking being without being mancannot be known

or inferred from this proposition




thus we have gained nothing as regards the cognition of myself as object by

the analysis of the consciousness of my self in thought the logical exposition

of thought in general is mistaken for a metaphysical determination of the

object




our critique would be an investigation utterly superfluous if there existed a

possibility of proving  priori that all thinking beings are in themselves

simple substances as such therefore possess the inseparable attribute of

personality and are conscious of their existence apart from and unconnected

with matter for we should thus have taken a step beyond the world of sense

and have penetrated into the sphere of noumena and in this case the right

could not be denied us of extending our knowledge in this sphere of

establishing ourselves and under a favouring star appropriating to ourselves

possessions in it for the proposition every thinking being as such

is simple substance is an  priori synthetical proposition because in

the first place it goes beyond the conception which is the subject of it and

adds to the mere notion of a thinking being the mode of its existence and in

the second place annexes a predicate that of simplicity to the latter

conceptiona predicate which it could not have discovered in the sphere

of experience it would follow that  priori synthetical propositions are

possible and legitimate not only as we have maintained in relation to

objects of possible experience and as principles of the possibility of this

experience itself but are applicable to things in themselvesan

inference which makes an end of the whole of this critique and obliges us to

fall back on the old mode of metaphysical procedure but indeed the danger is

not so great if we look a little closer into the question




there lurks in the procedure of rational psychology a paralogism which is

represented in the following syllogism




that which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject does not exist

otherwise than as subject and is therefore substance




a thinking being considered merely as such cannot be cogitated otherwise than

as subject




therefore it exists also as such that is as substance




in the major we speak of a being that can be cogitated generally and in every

relation consequently as it may be given in intuition but in the minor we

speak of the same being only in so far as it regards itself as subject

relatively to thought and the unity of consciousness but not in relation to

intuition by which it is presented as an object to thought thus the

conclusion is here arrived at by a sophisma figurae dictionis44


 44

thought is taken in the two premisses in two totally different senses in the

major it is considered as relating and applying to objects in general

consequently to objects of intuition also in the minor we understand it as

relating merely to selfconsciousness in this sense we do not cogitate an

object but merely the relation to the selfconsciousness of the subject as

the form of thought in the former premiss we speak of things which cannot be

cogitated otherwise than as subjects in the second we do not speak of things

but of thought all objects being abstracted in which the ego is always the

subject of consciousness hence the conclusion cannot be i cannot exist

otherwise than as subject but only i can in cogitating my

existence employ my ego only as the subject of the judgement but this

is an identical proposition and throws no light on the mode of my existence




that this famous argument is a mere paralogism will be plain to any one who

will consider the general remark which precedes our exposition of the

principles of the pure understanding and the section on noumena for it was

there proved that the conception of a thing which can exist per seonly

as a subject and never as a predicate possesses no objective reality that is

to say we can never know whether there exists any object to correspond to the

conception consequently the conception is nothing more than a conception and

from it we derive no proper knowledge if this conception is to indicate by the

term substance an object that can be given if it is to become a cognition we

must have at the foundation of the cognition a permanent intuition as the

indispensable condition of its objective reality for through intuition alone

can an object be given but in internal intuition there is nothing permanent

for the ego is but the consciousness of my thought if then we appeal merely

to thought we cannot discover the necessary condition of the application of

the conception of substancethat is of a subject existing per

seto the subject as a thinking being and thus the conception of the

simple nature of substance which is connected with the objective reality of

this conception is shown to be also invalid and to be in fact nothing more

than the logical qualitative unity of selfconsciousness in thought whilst we

remain perfectly ignorant whether the subject is composite or not




refutation of the argument of mendelssohn for the substantiality or permanence

of the soul




this acute philosopher easily perceived the insufficiency of the common

argument which attempts to prove that the soulit being granted that it

is a simple beingcannot perish by dissolution or decomposition he saw

it is not impossible for it to cease to be by extinction or disappearance he

endeavoured to prove in his phaedo that the soul cannot be annihilated by

showing that a simple being cannot cease to exist inasmuch as he said a

simple existence cannot diminish nor gradually lose portions of its being and

thus be by degrees reduced to nothing for it possesses no parts and therefore

no multiplicity between the moment in which it is and the moment in which it

is not no time can be discoveredwhich is impossible but this

philosopher did not consider that granting the soul to possess this simple

nature which contains no parts external to each other and consequently no

extensive quantity we cannot refuse to it any less than to any other being

intensive quantity that is a degree of reality in regard to all its

faculties nay to all that constitutes its existence but this degree of

reality can become less and less through an infinite series of smaller degrees

it follows therefore that this supposed substancethis thing the

permanence of which is not assured in any other way may if not by

decomposition by gradual loss remissio of its powers consequently by

elanguescence if i may employ this expression be changed into nothing for

consciousness itself has always a degree which may be lessened45 consequently the faculty of being

conscious may be diminished and so with all other faculties the permanence of

the soul therefore as an object of the internal sense remains

undemonstrated nay even indemonstrable its permanence in life is evident

per se inasmuch as the thinking being as man is to itself at the same time

an object of the external senses but this does not authorize the rational

psychologist to affirm from mere conceptions its permanence beyond life46


 45

clearness is not as logicians maintain the consciousness of a representation

for a certain degree of consciousness which may not however be sufficient

for recollection is to be met with in many dim representations for without

any consciousness at all we should not be able to recognize any difference in

the obscure representations we connect as we really can do with many

conceptions such as those of right and justice and those of the musician who

strikes at once several notes in improvising a piece of music but a

representation is clear in which our consciousness is sufficient for the

consciousness of the difference of this representation from others if we are

only conscious that there is a difference but are not conscious of the

differencethat is what the difference isthe representation must

be termed obscure there is consequently an infinite series of degrees of

consciousness down to its entire disappearance



 46

there are some who think they have done enough to establish a new possibility

in the mode of the existence of souls when they have shown that there is no

contradiction in their hypotheses on this subject such are those who affirm

the possibility of thoughtof which they have no other knowledge than

what they derive from its use in connecting empirical intuitions presented in

this our human lifeafter this life has ceased but it is very easy to

embarrass them by the introduction of counterpossibilities which rest upon

quite as good a foundation such for example is the possibility of the

division of a simple substance into several substances and conversely of the

coalition of several into one simple substance for although divisibility

presupposes composition it does not necessarily require a composition of

substances but only of the degrees of the several faculties of one and the

same substance now we can cogitate all the powers and faculties of the

souleven that of consciousnessas diminished by one half the

substance still remaining in the same way we can represent to ourselves

without contradiction this obliterated half as preserved not in the soul but

without it and we can believe that as in this case every thing that is real

in the soul and has a degreeconsequently its entire existencehas

been halved a particular substance would arise out of the soul for the

multiplicity which has been divided formerly existed but not as a

multiplicity of substances but of every reality as the quantum of existence in

it and the unity of substance was merely a mode of existence which by this

division alone has been transformed into a plurality of subsistence in the

same manner several simple substances might coalesce into one without anything

being lost except the plurality of subsistence inasmuch as the one substance

would contain the degree of reality of all the former substances perhaps

indeed the simple substances which appear under the form of matter might

not indeed by a mechanical or chemical influence upon each other but by an

unknown influence of which the former would be but the phenomenal appearance

by means of such a dynamical division of the parentsouls as intensive

quantities produce other souls while the former repaired the loss thus

sustained with new matter of the same sort i am far from allowing any value to

such chimeras and the principles of our analytic have clearly proved that no

other than an empirical use of the categoriesthat of substance for

exampleis possible but if the rationalist is bold enough to construct

on the mere authority of the faculty of thoughtwithout any intuition

whereby an object is givena selfsubsistent being merely because the

unity of apperception in thought cannot allow him to believe it a composite

being instead of declaring as he ought to do that he is unable to explain

the possibility of a thinking nature what ought to hinder the materialist

with as complete an independence of experience to employ the principle of the

rationalist in a directly opposite mannerstill preserving the formal

unity required by his opponent




if now we take the above propositionsas they must be accepted as valid

for all thinking beings in the system of rational psychologyin

synthetical connection and proceed from the category of relation with the

proposition all thinking beings are as such substances

backwards through the series till the circle is completed we come at last to

their existence of which in this system of rational psychology substances

are held to be conscious independently of external things nay it is asserted

that in relation to the permanence which is a necessary characteristic of

substance they can of themselves determine external things it follows that

idealismat least problematical idealism is perfectly unavoidable in

this rationalistic system and if the existence of outward things is not held

to be requisite to the determination of the existence of a substance in time

the existence of these outward things at all is a gratuitous assumption which

remains without the possibility of a proof




but if we proceed analyticallythe i think as a proposition

containing in itself an existence as given consequently modality being the

principleand dissect this proposition in order to ascertain its

content and discover whether and how this ego determines its existence in time

and space without the aid of anything external the propositions of

rationalistic psychology would not begin with the conception of a thinking

being but with a reality and the properties of a thinking being in general

would be deduced from the mode in which this reality is cogitated after

everything empirical had been abstracted as is shown in the following table




                        1

                      i think



            2                             3

        as subject              as simple subject



                        4

               as identical subject

           in every state of my thought




now inasmuch as it is not determined in this second proposition whether i can

exist and be cogitated only as subject and not also as a predicate of another

being the conception of a subject is here taken in a merely logical sense and

it remains undetermined whether substance is to be cogitated under the

conception or not but in the third proposition the absolute unity of

apperceptionthe simple ego in the representation to which all connection

and separation which constitute thought relate is of itself important even

although it presents us with no information about the constitution or

subsistence of the subject apperception is something real and the simplicity

of its nature is given in the very fact of its possibility now in space there

is nothing real that is at the same time simple for points which are the only

simple things in space are merely limits but not constituent parts of space

from this follows the impossibility of a definition on the basis of materialism

of the constitution of my ego as a merely thinking subject but because my

existence is considered in the first proposition as given for it does not

mean every thinking being exists for this would be predicating

of them absolute necessity but only i exist thinking the

proposition is quite empirical and contains the determinability of my

existence merely in relation to my representations in time but as i require

for this purpose something that is permanent such as is not given in internal

intuition the mode of my existence whether as substance or as accident

cannot be determined by means of this simple selfconsciousness thus if

materialism is inadequate to explain the mode in which i exist spiritualism is

likewise as insufficient and the conclusion is that we are utterly unable to

attain to any knowledge of the constitution of the soul in so far as relates

to the possibility of its existence apart from external objects




and indeed how should it be possible merely by the aid of the unity of

consciousnesswhich we cognize only for the reason that it is

indispensable to the possibility of experienceto pass the bounds of

experience our existence in this life and to extend our cognition to the

nature of all thinking beings by means of the empiricalbut in relation

to every sort of intuition perfectly undeterminedproposition i

think




there does not then exist any rational psychology as a doctrine furnishing any

addition to our knowledge of ourselves it is nothing more than a discipline

which sets impassable limits to speculative reason in this region of thought

to prevent it on the one hand from throwing itself into the arms of a

soulless materialism and on the other from losing itself in the mazes of a

baseless spiritualism it teaches us to consider this refusal of our reason to

give any satisfactory answer to questions which reach beyond the limits of this

our human life as a hint to abandon fruitless speculation and to direct to a

practical use our knowledge of ourselveswhich although applicable only

to objects of experience receives its principles from a higher source and

regulates its procedure as if our destiny reached far beyond the boundaries of

experience and life




from all this it is evident that rational psychology has its origin in a mere

misunderstanding the unity of consciousness which lies at the basis of the

categories is considered to be an intuition of the subject as an object and

the category of substance is applied to the intuition but this unity is

nothing more than the unity in thought by which no object is given to which

therefore the category of substancewhich always presupposes a given

intuitioncannot be applied consequently the subject cannot be

cognized the subject of the categories cannot therefore for the very reason

that it cogitates these frame any conception of itself as an object of the

categories for to cogitate these it must lay at the foundation its own pure

selfconsciousnessthe very thing that it wishes to explain and describe

in like manner the subject in which the representation of time has its basis

cannot determine for this very reason its own existence in time now if the

latter is impossible the former as an attempt to determine itself by means of

the categories as a thinking being in general is no less so47

the i think is as has been already stated an empirical

proposition and contains the proposition i exist but i cannot

say everything which thinks exists for in this case the

property of thought would constitute all beings possessing it necessary

beings hence my existence cannot be considered as an inference from the

proposition i think as descartes maintainedbecause in

this case the major premiss everything which thinks exists

must precedebut the two propositions are identical the proposition

i think expresses an undetermined empirical intuition that

perception proving consequently that sensation which must belong to

sensibility lies at the foundation of this proposition but it precedes

experience whose province it is to determine an object of perception by means

of the categories in relation to time and existence in this proposition is not

a category as it does not apply to an undetermined given object but only to

one of which we have a conception and about which we wish to know whether it

does or does not exist out of and apart from this conception an undetermined

perception signifies here merely something real that has been given only

however to thought in generalbut not as a phenomenon nor as a thing in

itself noumenon but only as something that really exists and is designated

as such in the proposition i think for it must be remarked

that when i call the proposition i think an empirical

proposition i do not thereby mean that the ego in the proposition is an

empirical representation on the contrary it is purely intellectual because

it belongs to thought in general but without some empirical representation

which presents to the mind material for thought the mental act i

think would not take place and the empirical is only the condition of

the application or employment of the pure intellectual faculty




thus then appears the vanity of the hope of establishing a cognition which is

to extend its rule beyond the limits of experiencea cognition which is

one of the highest interests of humanity and thus is proved the futility of

the attempt of speculative philosophy in this region of thought but in this

interest of thought the severity of criticism has rendered to reason a not

unimportant service by the demonstration of the impossibility of making any

dogmatical affirmation concerning an object of experience beyond the boundaries

of experience she has thus fortified reason against all affirmations of the

contrary now this can be accomplished in only two ways either our

proposition must be proved apodeictically or if this is unsuccessful the

sources of this inability must be sought for and if these are discovered to

exist in the natural and necessary limitation of our reason our opponents must

submit to the same law of renunciation and refrain from advancing claims to

dogmatic assertion




but the right say rather the necessity to admit a future life upon principles

of the practical conjoined with the speculative use of reason has lost nothing

by this renunciation for the merely speculative proof has never had any

influence upon the common reason of men it stands upon the point of a hair so

that even the schools have been able to preserve it from falling only by

incessantly discussing it and spinning it like a top and even in their eyes it

has never been able to present any safe foundation for the erection of a

theory the proofs which have been current among men preserve their value

undiminished nay rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power by the

rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason for reason is

thus confined within her own peculiar provincethe arrangement of ends or

aims which is at the same time the arrangement of nature and as a practical

faculty without limiting itself to the latter it is justified in extending

the former and with it our own existence beyond the boundaries of experience

and life if we turn our attention to the analogy of the nature of living

beings in this world in the consideration of which reason is obliged to accept

as a principle that no organ no faculty no appetite is useless and that

nothing is superfluous nothing disproportionate to its use nothing unsuited

to its end but that on the contrary everything is perfectly conformed to its

destination in lifewe shall find that man who alone is the final end

and aim of this order is still the only animal that seems to be excepted from

it for his natural giftsnot merely as regards the talents and motives

that may incite him to employ them but especially the moral law in

himstretch so far beyond all mere earthly utility and advantage that he

feels himself bound to prize the mere consciousness of probity apart from all

advantageous consequenceseven the shadowy gift of posthumous

fameabove everything and he is conscious of an inward call to

constitute himself by his conduct in this worldwithout regard to mere

sublunary intereststhe citizen of a better this mighty irresistible

proofaccompanied by an everincreasing knowledge of the conformability

to a purpose in everything we see around us by the conviction of the boundless

immensity of creation by the consciousness of a certain illimitableness in the

possible extension of our knowledge and by a desire commensurate

therewithremains to humanity even after the theoretical cognition of

ourselves has failed to establish the necessity of an existence after

death


conclusion of the solution of the psychological paralogism




the dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our confounding an

idea of reason of a pure intelligence with the conceptionin every

respect undeterminedof a thinking being in general i cogitate myself in

behalf of a possible experience at the same time making abstraction of all

actual experience and infer therefrom that i can be conscious of myself apart

from experience and its empirical conditions i consequently confound the

possible abstraction of my empirically determined existence with the supposed

consciousness of a possible separate existence of my thinking self and i

believe that i cognize what is substantial in myself as a transcendental

subject when i have nothing more in thought than the unity of consciousness

which lies at the basis of all determination of cognition




the task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not

properly belong to the psychology of which we are here speaking because it

proposes to prove the personality of the soul apart from this communion after

death and is therefore transcendent in the proper sense of the word although

occupying itself with an object of experienceonly in so far however as

it ceases to be an object of experience but a sufficient answer may be found

to the question in our system the difficulty which lies in the execution of

this task consists as is well known in the presupposed heterogeneity of the

object of the internal sense the soul and the objects of the external senses

inasmuch as the formal condition of the intuition of the one is time and of

that of the other space also but if we consider that both kinds of objects do

not differ internally but only in so far as the one appears externally to the

otherconsequently that what lies at the basis of phenomena as a thing

in itself may not be heterogeneous this difficulty disappears there then

remains no other difficulty than is to be found in the questionhow a

community of substances is possible a question which lies out of the region of

psychology and which the reader after what in our analytic has been said of

primitive forces and faculties will easily judge to be also beyond the region

of human cognition




general remark




on the transition from rational psychology to cosmology




the proposition i think or i exist thinking is

an empirical proposition but such a proposition must be based on empirical

intuition and the object cogitated as a phenomenon and thus our theory

appears to maintain that the soul even in thought is merely a phenomenon and

in this way our consciousness itself in fact abuts upon nothing




thought per se is merely the purely spontaneous logical function which

operates to connect the manifold of a possible intuition and it does not

represent the subject of consciousness as a phenomenonfor this reason

alone that it pays no attention to the question whether the mode of intuiting

it is sensuous or intellectual i therefore do not represent myself in thought

either as i am or as i appear to myself i merely cogitate myself as an object

in general of the mode of intuiting which i make abstraction when i represent

myself as the subject of thought or as the ground of thought these modes of

representation are not related to the categories of substance or of cause for

these are functions of thought applicable only to our sensuous intuition the

application of these categories to the ego would however be necessary if i

wished to make myself an object of knowledge but i wish to be conscious of

myself only as thinking in what mode my self is given in intuition i do not

consider and it may be that i who think am a phenomenonalthough not

in so far as i am a thinking being but in the consciousness of myself in mere

thought i am a being though this consciousness does not present to me any

property of this being as material for thought




but the proposition i think in so far as it declares i

exist thinking is not the mere representation of a logical function it

determines the subject which is in this case an object also in relation to

existence and it cannot be given without the aid of the internal sense whose

intuition presents to us an object not as a thing in itself but always as a

phenomenon in this proposition there is therefore something more to be found

than the mere spontaneity of thought there is also the receptivity of

intuition that is my thought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of

myself now in this intuition the thinking self must seek the conditions of

the employment of its logical functions as categories of substance cause and

so forth not merely for the purpose of distinguishing itself as an object in

itself by means of the representation i but also for the purpose

of determining the mode of its existence that is of cognizing itself as

noumenon but this is impossible for the internal empirical intuition is

sensuous and presents us with nothing but phenomenal data which do not assist

the object of pure consciousness in its attempt to cognize itself as a separate

existence but are useful only as contributions to experience




but let it be granted that we could discover not in experience but in

certain firmlyestablished  priori laws of the use of pure reasonlaws

relating to our existence authority to consider ourselves as legislating 

priori in relation to our own existence and as determining this existence we

should on this supposition find ourselves possessed of a spontaneity by

which our actual existence would be determinable without the aid of the

conditions of empirical intuition we should also become aware that in the

consciousness of our existence there was an  priori content which would serve

to determine our own existencean existence only sensuously

determinablerelatively however to a certain internal faculty in

relation to an intelligible world




but this would not give the least help to the attempts of rational psychology

for this wonderful faculty which the consciousness of the moral law in me

reveals would present me with a principle of the determination of my own

existence which is purely intellectualbut by what predicates by none

other than those which are given in sensuous intuition thus i should find

myself in the same position in rational psychology which i formerly occupied

that is to say i should find myself still in need of sensuous intuitions in

order to give significance to my conceptions of substance and cause by means

of which alone i can possess a knowledge of myself but these intuitions can

never raise me above the sphere of experience i should be justified however

in applying these conceptions in regard to their practical use which is

always directed to objects of experiencein conformity with their

analogical significance when employed theoreticallyto freedom and its

subject at the same time i should understand by them merely the logical

functions of subject and predicate of principle and consequence in conformity

with which all actions are so determined that they are capable of being

explained along with the laws of nature conformably to the categories of

substance and cause although they originate from a very different principle

we have made these observations for the purpose of guarding against

misunderstanding to which the doctrine of our intuition of self as a

phenomenon is exposed we shall have occasion to perceive their utility in the

sequel


chapter ii the antinomy of pure reason


we showed in the introduction to this part of our work that all transcendental

illusion of pure reason arose from dialectical arguments the schema of which

logic gives us in its three formal species of syllogismsjust as the

categories find their logical schema in the four functions of all judgements

the first kind of these sophistical arguments related to the unconditioned

unity of the subjective conditions of all representations in general of the

subject or soul in correspondence with the categorical syllogisms the major

of which as the principle enounces the relation of a predicate to a subject

the second kind of dialectical argument will therefore be concerned following

the analogy with hypothetical syllogisms with the unconditioned unity of the

objective conditions in the phenomenon and in this way the theme of the

third kind to be treated of in the following chapter will be the unconditioned

unity of the objective conditions of the possibility of objects in general




but it is worthy of remark that the transcendental paralogism produced in the

mind only a onethird illusion in regard to the idea of the subject of our

thought and the conceptions of reason gave no ground to maintain the contrary

proposition the advantage is completely on the side of pneumatism although

this theory itself passes into naught in the crucible of pure reason




very different is the case when we apply reason to the objective synthesis of

phenomena here certainly reason establishes with much plausibility its

principle of unconditioned unity but it very soon falls into such

contradictions that it is compelled in relation to cosmology to renounce its

pretensions




for here a new phenomenon of human reason meets usa perfectly natural

antithetic which does not require to be sought for by subtle sophistry but

into which reason of itself unavoidably falls it is thereby preserved to be

sure from the slumber of a fancied convictionwhich a merely onesided

illusion produces but it is at the same time compelled either on the one

hand to abandon itself to a despairing scepticism or on the other to assume

a dogmatical confidence and obstinate persistence in certain assertions

without granting a fair hearing to the other side of the question either is

the death of a sound philosophy although the former might perhaps deserve the

title of the euthanasia of pure reason




before entering this region of discord and confusion which the conflict of the

laws of pure reason antinomy produces we shall present the reader with some

considerations in explanation and justification of the method we intend to

follow in our treatment of this subject i term all transcendental ideas in so

far as they relate to the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena

cosmical conceptions partly on account of this unconditioned totality on

which the conception of the worldwhole is baseda conception which is

itself an ideapartly because they relate solely to the synthesis of

phenomenathe empirical synthesis while on the other hand the absolute

totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possible things gives rise

to an ideal of pure reason which is quite distinct from the cosmical

conception although it stands in relation with it hence as the paralogisms

of pure reason laid the foundation for a dialectical psychology the antinomy

of pure reason will present us with the transcendental principles of a

pretended pure rational cosmologynot however to declare it valid and

to appropriate it butas the very term of a conflict of reason

sufficiently indicates to present it as an idea which cannot be reconciled

with phenomena and experience


section i system of cosmological ideas


that we may be able to enumerate with systematic precision these ideas

according to a principle we must remark in the first place that it is from

the understanding alone that pure and transcendental conceptions take their

origin that the reason does not properly give birth to any conception but

only frees the conception of the understanding from the unavoidable limitation

of a possible experience and thus endeavours to raise it above the empirical

though it must still be in connection with it this happens from the fact that

for a given conditioned reason demands absolute totality on the side of the

conditions to which the understanding submits all phenomena and thus makes

of the category a transcendental idea this it does that it may be able to give

absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis by continuing it to the

unconditioned which is not to be found in experience but only in the idea

reason requires this according to the principle if the conditioned is given

the whole of the conditions and consequently the absolutely unconditioned is

also given whereby alone the former was possible first then the

transcendental ideas are properly nothing but categories elevated to the

unconditioned and they may be arranged in a table according to the titles of

the latter but secondly all the categories are not available for this

purpose but only those in which the synthesis constitutes a seriesof

conditions subordinated to not coordinated with each other absolute

totality is required of reason only in so far as concerns the ascending series

of the conditions of a conditioned not consequently when the question

relates to the descending series of consequences or to the aggregate of the

coordinated conditions of these consequences for in relation to a given

conditioned conditions are presupposed and considered to be given along with

it on the other hand as the consequences do not render possible their

conditions but rather presuppose themin the consideration of the

procession of consequences or in the descent from the given condition to the

conditioned we may be quite unconcerned whether the series ceases or not and

their totality is not a necessary demand of reason




thus we cogitateand necessarilya given time completely elapsed up

to a given moment although that time is not determinable by us but as regards

time future which is not the condition of arriving at the present in order to

conceive it it is quite indifferent whether we consider future time as ceasing

at some point or as prolonging itself to infinity take for example the

series m n o in which n is given as conditioned in relation to m but at the

same time as the condition of o and let the series proceed upwards from the

conditioned n to m l k i etc and also downwards from the condition n to

the conditioned o p q r etci must presuppose the former series to

be able to consider n as given and n is according to reason the totality of

conditions possible only by means of that series but its possibility does not

rest on the following series o p q r which for this reason cannot be

regarded as given but only as capable of being given dabilis




i shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of the

conditionsfrom that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the more

remoteregressive that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned

from the immediate consequence to the more remote i shall call the progressive

synthesis the former proceeds in antecedentia the latter in consequentia the

cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with the totality of the regressive

synthesis and proceed in antecedentia not in consequentia when the latter

takes place it is an arbitrary and not a necessary problem of pure reason for

we require for the complete understanding of what is given in a phenomenon

not the consequences which succeed but the grounds or principles which

precede




in order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with the table of

categories we take first the two primitive quanta of all our intuitions time

and space time is in itself a series and the formal condition of all series

and hence in relation to a given present we must distinguish  priori in it

the antecedentia as conditions time past from the consequentia time future

consequently the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of

the conditions of a given conditioned relates merely to all past time

according to the idea of reason the whole past time as the condition of the

given moment is necessarily cogitated as given but as regards space there

exists in it no distinction between progressus and regressus for it is an

aggregate and not a seriesits parts existing together at the same time

i can consider a given point of time in relation to past time only as

conditioned because this given moment comes into existence only through the

past time rather through the passing of the preceding time but as the parts of

space are not subordinated but coordinated to each other one part cannot be

the condition of the possibility of the other and space is not in itself like

time a series but the synthesis of the manifold parts of spacethe

syntheses whereby we apprehend spaceis nevertheless successive it

takes place therefore in time and contains a series and as in this series

of aggregated spaces for example the feet in a rood beginning with a given

portion of space those which continue to be annexed form the condition of the

limits of the formerthe measurement of a space must also be regarded as

a synthesis of the series of the conditions of a given conditioned it differs

however in this respect from that of time that the side of the conditioned is

not in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition and

consequently regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical but

inasmuch as one part of space is not given but only limited by and through

another we must also consider every limited space as conditioned in so far as

it presupposes some other space as the condition of its limitation and so on

as regards limitation therefore our procedure in space is also a regressus

and the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in a

series of conditions applies to space also and i am entitled to demand the

absolute totality of the phenomenal synthesis in space as well as in time

whether my demand can be satisfied is a question to be answered in the sequel




secondly the real in spacethat is matteris conditioned its

internal conditions are its parts and the parts of parts its remote

conditions so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis the absolute

totality of which is a demand of reason but this cannot be obtained otherwise

than by a complete division of parts whereby the real in matter becomes either

nothing or that which is not matter that is to say the simple consequently

we find here also a series of conditions and a progress to the unconditioned




thirdly as regards the categories of a real relation between phenomena the

category of substance and its accidents is not suitable for the formation of a

transcendental idea that is to say reason has no ground in regard to it to

proceed regressively with conditions for accidents in so far as they inhere

in a substance are coordinated with each other and do not constitute a

series and in relation to substance they are not properly subordinated to

it but are the mode of existence of the substance itself the conception of

the substantial might nevertheless seem to be an idea of the transcendental

reason but as this signifies nothing more than the conception of an object in

general which subsists in so far as we cogitate in it merely a transcendental

subject without any predicates and as the question here is of an unconditioned

in the series of phenomenait is clear that the substantial can form no

member thereof the same holds good of substances in community which are mere

aggregates and do not form a series for they are not subordinated to each

other as conditions of the possibility of each other which however may be

affirmed of spaces the limits of which are never determined in themselves but

always by some other space it is therefore only in the category of causality

that we can find a series of causes to a given effect and in which we ascend

from the latter as the conditioned to the former as the conditions and thus

answer the question of reason




fourthly the conceptions of the possible the actual and the necessary do not

conduct us to any seriesexcepting only in so far as the contingent in

existence must always be regarded as conditioned and as indicating according

to a law of the understanding a condition under which it is necessary to rise

to a higher till in the totality of the series reason arrives at

unconditioned necessity




there are accordingly only four cosmological ideas corresponding with the

four titles of the categories for we can select only such as necessarily

furnish us with a series in the synthesis of the manifold




                      1

            the absolute completeness

                    of the

                 composition

     of the given totality of all phenomena



                      2

            the absolute completeness

                    of the

                   division

     of given totality in a phenomenon



                       3

            the absolute completeness

                     of the

                   origination

                  of a phenomenon



                       4

            the absolute completeness

         of the dependence of the existence

        of what is changeable in a phenomenon




we must here remark in the first place that the idea of absolute totality

relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena and therefore not to the

pure conception of a totality of things phenomena are here therefore

regarded as given and reason requires the absolute completeness of the

conditions of their possibility in so far as these conditions constitute a

seriesconsequently an absolutely that is in every respect complete

synthesis whereby a phenomenon can be explained according to the laws of the

understanding




secondly it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks in this

serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions it wishes to

speak in another way to attain to completeness in the series of premisses so

as to render it unnecessary to presuppose others this unconditioned is always

contained in the absolute totality of the series when we endeavour to form a

representation of it in thought but this absolutely complete synthesis is

itself but an idea for it is impossible at least before hand to know whether

any such synthesis is possible in the case of phenomena when we represent all

existence in thought by means of pure conceptions of the understanding without

any conditions of sensuous intuition we may say with justice that for a given

conditioned the whole series of conditions subordinated to each other is also

given for the former is only given through the latter but we find in the case

of phenomena a particular limitation of the mode in which conditions are given

that is through the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition which

must be complete in the regress now whether this completeness is sensuously

possible is a problem but the idea of it lies in the reasonbe it

possible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empirical conceptions

therefore as in the absolute totality of the regressive synthesis of the

manifold in a phenomenon following the guidance of the categories which

represent it as a series of conditions to a given conditioned the

unconditioned is necessarily containedit being still left unascertained

whether and how this totality exists reason sets out from the idea of

totality although its proper and final aim is the unconditionedof the

whole series or of a part thereof




this unconditioned may be cogitatedeither as existing only in the entire

series all the members of which therefore would be without exception

conditioned and only the totality absolutely unconditionedand in this

case the regressus is called infinite or the absolutely unconditioned is only

a part of the series to which the other members are subordinated but which is

not itself submitted to any other condition48 in the former

case the series is a parte priori unlimited without beginning that is

infinite and nevertheless completely given but the regress in it is never

completed and can only be called potentially infinite in the second case

there exists a first in the series this first is called in relation to past

time the beginning of the world in relation to space the limit of the world

in relation to the parts of a given limited whole the simple in relation to

causes absolute spontaneity liberty and in relation to the existence of

changeable things absolute physical necessity



 48

the absolute totality of the series of conditions to a given conditioned is

always unconditioned because beyond it there exist no other conditions on

which it might depend but the absolute totality of such a series is only an

idea or rather a problematical conception the possibility of which must be

investigatedparticularly in relation to the mode in which the

unconditioned as the transcendental idea which is the real subject of inquiry

may be contained therein




we possess two expressions world and nature which are generally interchanged

the first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena and the totality of

their synthesisin its progress by means of composition as well as by

division and the world is termed nature49 when it is

regarded as a dynamical wholewhen our attention is not directed to the

aggregation in space and time for the purpose of cogitating it as a quantity

but to the unity in the existence of phenomena in this case the condition of

that which happens is called a cause the unconditioned causality of the cause

in a phenomenon is termed liberty the conditioned cause is called in a more

limited sense a natural cause the conditioned in existence is termed

contingent and the unconditioned necessary the unconditioned necessity of

phenomena may be called natural necessity



 49

nature understood adjective formaliter signifies the complex of the

determinations of a thing connected according to an internal principle of

causality on the other hand we understand by nature substantive

materialiter the sum total of phenomena in so far as they by virtue of an

internal principle of causality are connected with each other throughout in

the former sense we speak of the nature of liquid matter of fire etc and

employ the word only adjective while if speaking of the objects of nature we

have in our minds the idea of a subsisting whole




the ideas which we are at present engaged in discussing i have called

cosmological ideas partly because by the term world is understood the entire

content of all phenomena and our ideas are directed solely to the

unconditioned among phenomena partly also because world in the

transcendental sense signifies the absolute totality of the content of

existing things and we are directing our attention only to the completeness of

the synthesisalthough properly only in regression in regard to the

fact that these ideas are all transcendent and although they do not transcend

phenomena as regards their mode but are concerned solely with the world of

sense and not with noumena nevertheless carry their synthesis to a degree

far above all possible experienceit still seems to me that we can with

perfect propriety designate them cosmical conceptions as regards the

distinction between the mathematically and the dynamically unconditioned which

is the aim of the regression of the synthesis i should call the two former in

a more limited signification cosmical conceptions the remaining two

transcendent physical conceptions this distinction does not at present seem to

be of particular importance but we shall afterwards find it to be of some

value


section ii antithetic of pure reason


thetic is the term applied to every collection of dogmatical propositions by

antithetic i do not understand dogmatical assertions of the opposite but the

selfcontradiction of seemingly dogmatical cognitions thesis cum antithesis

in none of which we can discover any decided superiority antithetic is not

therefore occupied with onesided statements but is engaged in considering

the contradictory nature of the general cognitions of reason and its causes

transcendental antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of pure reason

its causes and result if we employ our reason not merely in the application of

the principles of the understanding to objects of experience but venture with

it beyond these boundaries there arise certain sophistical propositions or

theorems these assertions have the following peculiarities they can find

neither confirmation nor confutation in experience and each is in itself not

only selfconsistent but possesses conditions of its necessity in the very

nature of reasononly that unluckily there exist just as valid and

necessary grounds for maintaining the contrary proposition




the questions which naturally arise in the consideration of this dialectic of

pure reason are therefore 1st in what propositions is pure reason

unavoidably subject to an antinomy 2nd what are the causes of this antinomy

3rd whether and in what way can reason free itself from this

selfcontradiction




a dialectical proposition or theorem of pure reason must according to what has

been said be distinguishable from all sophistical propositions by the fact

that it is not an answer to an arbitrary question which may be raised at the

mere pleasure of any person but to one which human reason must necessarily

encounter in its progress in the second place a dialectical proposition with

its opposite does not carry the appearance of a merely artificial illusion

which disappears as soon as it is investigated but a natural and unavoidable

illusion which even when we are no longer deceived by it continues to mock

us and although rendered harmless can never be completely removed




this dialectical doctrine will not relate to the unity of understanding in

empirical conceptions but to the unity of reason in pure ideas the conditions

of this doctrine areinasmuch as it must as a synthesis according to

rules be conformable to the understanding and at the same time as the

absolute unity of the synthesis to the reasonthat if it is adequate to

the unity of reason it is too great for the understanding if according with

the understanding it is too small for the reason hence arises a mutual

opposition which cannot be avoided do what we will




these sophistical assertions of dialectic open as it were a battlefield

where that side obtains the victory which has been permitted to make the

attack and he is compelled to yield who has been unfortunately obliged to

stand on the defensive and hence champions of ability whether on the right

or on the wrong side are certain to carry away the crown of victory if they

only take care to have the right to make the last attack and are not obliged

to sustain another onset from their opponent we can easily believe that this

arena has been often trampled by the feet of combatants that many victories

have been obtained on both sides but that the last victory decisive of the

affair between the contending parties was won by him who fought for the right

only if his adversary was forbidden to continue the tourney as impartial

umpires we must lay aside entirely the consideration whether the combatants

are fighting for the right or for the wrong side for the true or for the

false and allow the combat to be first decided perhaps after they have

wearied more than injured each other they will discover the nothingness of

their cause of quarrel and part good friends




this method of watching or rather of originating a conflict of assertions

not for the purpose of finally deciding in favour of either side but to

discover whether the object of the struggle is not a mere illusion which each

strives in vain to reach but which would be no gain even when

reachedthis procedure i say may be termed the sceptical method it is

thoroughly distinct from scepticismthe principle of a technical and

scientific ignorance which undermines the foundations of all knowledge in

order if possible to destroy our belief and confidence therein for the

sceptical method aims at certainty by endeavouring to discover in a conflict

of this kind conducted honestly and intelligently on both sides the point of

misunderstanding just as wise legislators derive from the embarrassment of

judges in lawsuits information in regard to the defective and illdefined

parts of their statutes the antinomy which reveals itself in the application

of laws is for our limited wisdom the best criterion of legislation for the

attention of reason which in abstract speculation does not easily become

conscious of its errors is thus roused to the momenta in the determination of

its principles




but this sceptical method is essentially peculiar to transcendental philosophy

and can perhaps be dispensed with in every other field of investigation in

mathematics its use would be absurd because in it no false assertions can long

remain hidden inasmuch as its demonstrations must always proceed under the

guidance of pure intuition and by means of an always evident synthesis in

experimental philosophy doubt and delay may be very useful but no

misunderstanding is possible which cannot be easily removed and in experience

means of solving the difficulty and putting an end to the dissension must at

last be found whether sooner or later moral philosophy can always exhibit its

principles with their practical consequences in concretoat least in

possible experiences and thus escape the mistakes and ambiguities of

abstraction but transcendental propositions which lay claim to insight beyond

the region of possible experience cannot on the one hand exhibit their

abstract synthesis in any  priori intuition nor on the other expose a

lurking error by the help of experience transcendental reason therefore

presents us with no other criterion than that of an attempt to reconcile such

assertions and for this purpose to permit a free and unrestrained conflict

between them and this we now proceed to arrange50


 50

the antinomies stand in the order of the four transcendental ideas above

detailed




first conflict of the transcendental ideas thesis




the world has a beginning in time and is also limited in regard to space




proof




granted that the world has no beginning in time up to every given moment of

time an eternity must have elapsed and therewith passed away an infinite

series of successive conditions or states of things in the world now the

infinity of a series consists in the fact that it never can be completed by

means of a successive synthesis it follows that an infinite series already

elapsed is impossible and that consequently a beginning of the world is a

necessary condition of its existence and this was the first thing to be

proved




as regards the second let us take the opposite for granted in this case the

world must be an infinite given total of coexistent things now we cannot

cogitate the dimensions of a quantity which is not given within certain limits

of an intuition51 in any other way than by means of the

synthesis of its parts and the total of such a quantity only by means of a

completed synthesis or the repeated addition of unity to itself accordingly

to cogitate the world which fills all spaces as a whole the successive

synthesis of the parts of an infinite world must be looked upon as completed

that is to say an infinite time must be regarded as having elapsed in the

enumeration of all coexisting things which is impossible for this reason an

infinite aggregate of actual things cannot be considered as a given whole

consequently not as a contemporaneously given whole the world is

consequently as regards extension in space not infinite but enclosed in

limits and this was the second thing to be proved



 51

we may consider an undetermined quantity as a whole when it is enclosed within

limits although we cannot construct or ascertain its totality by measurement

that is by the successive synthesis of its parts for its limits of themselves

determine its completeness as a whole




antithesis




the world has no beginning and no limits in space but is in relation both to

time and space infinite




proof




for let it be granted that it has a beginning a beginning is an existence

which is preceded by a time in which the thing does not exist on the above

supposition it follows that there must have been a time in which the world did

not exist that is a void time but in a void time the origination of a thing

is impossible because no part of any such time contains a distinctive

condition of being in preference to that of nonbeing whether the supposed

thing originate of itself or by means of some other cause consequently many

series of things may have a beginning in the world but the world itself cannot

have a beginning and is therefore in relation to past time infinite




as regards the second statement let us first take the opposite for

grantedthat the world is finite and limited in space it follows that it

must exist in a void space which is not limited we should therefore meet not

only with a relation of things in space but also a relation of things to

space now as the world is an absolute whole out of and beyond which no

object of intuition and consequently no correlate to which can be discovered

this relation of the world to a void space is merely a relation to no object

but such a relation and consequently the limitation of the world by void

space is nothing consequently the world as regards space is not limited

that is it is infinite in regard to extension52


 52

space is merely the form of external intuition formal intuition and not a

real object which can be externally perceived space prior to all things which

determine it fill or limit it or rather which present an empirical

intuition conformable to it is under the title of absolute space nothing but

the mere possibility of external phenomena in so far as they either exist in

themselves or can annex themselves to given intuitions empirical intuition is

therefore not a composition of phenomena and space of perception and empty

intuition the one is not the correlate of the other in a synthesis but they

are vitally connected in the same empirical intuition as matter and form if

we wish to set one of these two apart from the otherspace from

phenomenathere arise all sorts of empty determinations of external

intuition which are very far from being possible perceptions for example

motion or rest of the world in an infinite empty space or a determination of

the mutual relation of both cannot possibly be perceived and is therefore

merely the predicate of a notional entity




observations on the first antinomy on the thesis




in bringing forward these conflicting arguments i have not been on the search

for sophisms for the purpose of availing myself of special pleading which

takes advantage of the carelessness of the opposite party appeals to a

misunderstood statute and erects its unrighteous claims upon an unfair

interpretation both proofs originate fairly from the nature of the case and

the advantage presented by the mistakes of the dogmatists of both parties has

been completely set aside




the thesis might also have been unfairly demonstrated by the introduction of

an erroneous conception of the infinity of a given quantity a quantity is

infinite if a greater than itself cannot possibly exist the quantity is

measured by the number of given unitswhich are taken as a

standardcontained in it now no number can be the greatest because one

or more units can always be added it follows that an infinite given quantity

consequently an infinite world both as regards time and extension is

impossible it is therefore limited in both respects in this manner i might

have conducted my proof but the conception given in it does not agree with the

true conception of an infinite whole in this there is no representation of its

quantity it is not said how large it is consequently its conception is not

the conception of a maximum we cogitate in it merely its relation to an

arbitrarily assumed unit in relation to which it is greater than any number

now just as the unit which is taken is greater or smaller the infinite will

be greater or smaller but the infinity which consists merely in the relation

to this given unit must remain always the same although the absolute quantity

of the whole is not thereby cognized




the true transcendental conception of infinity is that the successive

synthesis of unity in the measurement of a given quantum can never be

completed53 hence it follows without possibility

of mistake that an eternity of actual successive states up to a given the

present moment cannot have elapsed and that the world must therefore have a

beginning



 53

the quantum in this sense contains a congeries of given units which is greater

than any numberand this is the mathematical conception of the infinite




in regard to the second part of the thesis the difficulty as to an infinite

and yet elapsed series disappears for the manifold of a world infinite in

extension is contemporaneously given but in order to cogitate the total of

this manifold as we cannot have the aid of limits constituting by themselves

this total in intuition we are obliged to give some account of our conception

which in this case cannot proceed from the whole to the determined quantity of

the parts but must demonstrate the possibility of a whole by means of a

successive synthesis of the parts but as this synthesis must constitute a

series that cannot be completed it is impossible for us to cogitate prior to

it and consequently not by means of it a totality for the conception of

totality itself is in the present case the representation of a completed

synthesis of the parts and this completion and consequently its conception

is impossible




on the antithesis




the proof in favour of the infinity of the cosmical succession and the cosmical

content is based upon the consideration that in the opposite case a void time

and a void space must constitute the limits of the world now i am not unaware

that there are some ways of escaping this conclusion it may for example be

alleged that a limit to the world as regards both space and time is quite

possible without at the same time holding the existence of an absolute time

before the beginning of the world or an absolute space extending beyond the

actual worldwhich is impossible i am quite well satisfied with the

latter part of this opinion of the philosophers of the leibnitzian school

space is merely the form of external intuition but not a real object which can

itself be externally intuited it is not a correlate of phenomena it is the

form of phenomena itself space therefore cannot be regarded as absolutely

and in itself something determinative of the existence of things because it is

not itself an object but only the form of possible objects consequently

things as phenomena determine space that is to say they render it possible

that of all the possible predicates of space size and relation certain may

belong to reality but we cannot affirm the converse that space as something

selfsubsistent can determine real things in regard to size or shape for it

is in itself not a real thing space filled or void54 may therefore be

limited by phenomena but phenomena cannot be limited by an empty space without

them this is true of time also all this being granted it is nevertheless

indisputable that we must assume these two nonentities void space without and

void time before the world if we assume the existence of cosmical limits

relatively to space or time



 54

it is evident that what is meant here is that empty space in so far as it is

limited by phenomenaspace that is within the worlddoes not at

least contradict transcendental principles and may therefore as regards them

be admitted although its possibility cannot on that account be affirmed




for as regards the subterfuge adopted by those who endeavour to evade the

consequencethat if the world is limited as to space and time the

infinite void must determine the existence of actual things in regard to their

dimensionsit arises solely from the fact that instead of a sensuous

world an intelligible worldof which nothing is knownis

cogitated instead of a real beginning an existence which is preceded by a

period in which nothing exists an existence which presupposes no other

condition than that of time and instead of limits of extension boundaries of

the universe but the question relates to the mundus phaenomenon and its

quantity and in this case we cannot make abstraction of the conditions of

sensibility without doing away with the essential reality of this world

itself the world of sense if it is limited must necessarily lie in the

infinite void if this and with it space as the  priori condition of the

possibility of phenomena is left out of view the whole world of sense

disappears in our problem is this alone considered as given the mundus

intelligibilis is nothing but the general conception of a world in which

abstraction has been made of all conditions of intuition and in relation to

which no synthetical propositioneither affirmative or negativeis

possible




second conflict of transcendental ideas thesis




every composite substance in the world consists of simple parts and there

exists nothing that is not either itself simple or composed of simple parts




proof




for grant that composite substances do not consist of simple parts in this

case if all combination or composition were annihilated in thought no

composite part and as by the supposition there do not exist simple parts

no simple part would exist consequently no substance consequently nothing

would exist either then it is impossible to annihilate composition in

thought or after such annihilation there must remain something that subsists

without composition that is something that is simple but in the former case

the composite could not itself consist of substances because with substances

composition is merely a contingent relation apart from which they must still

exist as selfsubsistent beings now as this case contradicts the supposition

the second must contain the truththat the substantial composite in the

world consists of simple parts




it follows as an immediate inference that the things in the world are all

without exception simple beingsthat composition is merely an external

condition pertaining to themand that although we never can separate and

isolate the elementary substances from the state of composition reason must

cogitate these as the primary subjects of all composition and consequently as

prior theretoand as simple substances




antithesis




no composite thing in the world consists of simple parts and there does not

exist in the world any simple substance




proof




let it be supposed that a composite thing as substance consists of simple

parts inasmuch as all external relation consequently all composition of

substances is possible only in space the space occupied by that which is

composite must consist of the same number of parts as is contained in the

composite but space does not consist of simple parts but of spaces

therefore every part of the composite must occupy a space but the absolutely

primary parts of what is composite are simple it follows that what is simple

occupies a space now as everything real that occupies a space contains a

manifold the parts of which are external to each other and is consequently

compositeand a real composite not of accidents for these cannot exist

external to each other apart from substance but of substancesit

follows that the simple must be a substantial composite which is

selfcontradictory




the second proposition of the antithesisthat there exists in the world

nothing that is simpleis here equivalent to the following the existence

of the absolutely simple cannot be demonstrated from any experience or

perception either external or internal and the absolutely simple is a mere

idea the objective reality of which cannot be demonstrated in any possible

experience it is consequently in the exposition of phenomena without

application and object for let us take for granted that an object may be

found in experience for this transcendental idea the empirical intuition of

such an object must then be recognized to contain absolutely no manifold with

its parts external to each other and connected into unity now as we cannot

reason from the nonconsciousness of such a manifold to the impossibility of

its existence in the intuition of an object and as the proof of this

impossibility is necessary for the establishment and proof of absolute

simplicity it follows that this simplicity cannot be inferred from any

perception whatever as therefore an absolutely simple object cannot be given

in any experience and the world of sense must be considered as the sum total

of all possible experiences nothing simple exists in the world




this second proposition in the antithesis has a more extended aim than the

first the first merely banishes the simple from the intuition of the

composite while the second drives it entirely out of nature hence we were

unable to demonstrate it from the conception of a given object of external

intuition of the composite but we were obliged to prove it from the relation

of a given object to a possible experience in general




observations on the second antinomy thesis




when i speak of a whole which necessarily consists of simple parts i

understand thereby only a substantial whole as the true composite that is to

say i understand that contingent unity of the manifold which is given as

perfectly isolated at least in thought placed in reciprocal connection and

thus constituted a unity space ought not to be called a compositum but a

totum for its parts are possible in the whole and not the whole by means of

the parts it might perhaps be called a compositum ideale but not a compositum

reale but this is of no importance as space is not a composite of substances

and not even of real accidents if i abstract all composition

thereinnothing not even a point remains for a point is possible only

as the limit of a spaceconsequently of a composite space and time

therefore do not consist of simple parts that which belongs only to the

condition or state of a substance even although it possesses a quantity

motion or change for example likewise does not consist of simple parts

that is to say a certain degree of change does not originate from the addition

of many simple changes our inference of the simple from the composite is valid

only of selfsubsisting things but the accidents of a state are not

selfsubsistent the proof then for the necessity of the simple as the

component part of all that is substantial and composite may prove a failure

and the whole case of this thesis be lost if we carry the proposition too far

and wish to make it valid of everything that is composite without

distinctionas indeed has really now and then happened besides i am

here speaking only of the simple in so far as it is necessarily given in the

compositethe latter being capable of solution into the former as its

component parts the proper signification of the word monas as employed by

leibnitz ought to relate to the simple given immediately as simple substance

for example in consciousness and not as an element of the composite as an

clement the term atomus would be more appropriate and as i wish to prove the

existence of simple substances only in relation to and as the elements of

the composite i might term the antithesis of the second antinomy

transcendental atomistic but as this word has long been employed to designate

a particular theory of corporeal phenomena moleculae and thus presupposes a

basis of empirical conceptions i prefer calling it the dialectical principle

of monadology




antithesis




against the assertion of the infinite subdivisibility of matter whose ground of

proof is purely mathematical objections have been alleged by the monadists

these objections lay themselves open at first sight to suspicion from the

fact that they do not recognize the clearest mathematical proofs as

propositions relating to the constitution of space in so far as it is really

the formal condition of the possibility of all matter but regard them merely

as inferences from abstract but arbitrary conceptions which cannot have any

application to real things just as if it were possible to imagine another mode

of intuition than that given in the primitive intuition of space and just as

if its  priori determinations did not apply to everything the existence of

which is possible from the fact alone of its filling space if we listen to

them we shall find ourselves required to cogitate in addition to the

mathematical point which is simplenot however a part but a mere

limit of spacephysical points which are indeed likewise simple but

possess the peculiar property as parts of space of filling it merely by their

aggregation i shall not repeat here the common and clear refutations of this

absurdity which are to be found everywhere in numbers every one knows that it

is impossible to undermine the evidence of mathematics by mere discursive

conceptions i shall only remark that if in this case philosophy endeavours to

gain an advantage over mathematics by sophistical artifices it is because it

forgets that the discussion relates solely to phenomena and their conditions

it is not sufficient to find the conception of the simple for the pure

conception of the composite but we must discover for the intuition of the

composite matter the intuition of the simple now this according to the

laws of sensibility and consequently in the case of objects of sense is

utterly impossible in the case of a whole composed of substances which is

cogitated solely by the pure understanding it may be necessary to be in

possession of the simple before composition is possible but this does not hold

good of the totum substantiale phaenomenon which as an empirical intuition in

space possesses the necessary property of containing no simple part for the

very reason that no part of space is simple meanwhile the monadists have been

subtle enough to escape from this difficulty by presupposing intuition and the

dynamical relation of substances as the condition of the possibility of space

instead of regarding space as the condition of the possibility of the objects

of external intuition that is of bodies now we have a conception of bodies

only as phenomena and as such they necessarily presuppose space as the

condition of all external phenomena the evasion is therefore in vain as

indeed we have sufficiently shown in our sthetic if bodies were things in

themselves the proof of the monadists would be unexceptionable




the second dialectical assertion possesses the peculiarity of having opposed to

it a dogmatical proposition which among all such sophistical statements is

the only one that undertakes to prove in the case of an object of experience

that which is properly a transcendental ideathe absolute simplicity of

substance the proposition is that the object of the internal sense the

thinking ego is an absolute simple substance without at present entering upon

this subjectas it has been considered at length in a former

chapteri shall merely remark that if something is cogitated merely as

an object without the addition of any synthetical determination of its

intuitionas happens in the case of the bare representation iit

is certain that no manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a

representation as moreover the predicates whereby i cogitate this object are

merely intuitions of the internal sense there cannot be discovered in them

anything to prove the existence of a manifold whose parts are external to each

other and consequently nothing to prove the existence of real composition

consciousness therefore is so constituted that inasmuch as the thinking

subject is at the same time its own object it cannot divide

itselfalthough it can divide its inhering determinations for every

object in relation to itself is absolute unity nevertheless if the subject is

regarded externally as an object of intuition it must in its character of

phenomenon possess the property of composition and it must always be regarded

in this manner if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained in it a

manifold whose parts are external to each other




third conflict of the transcendental ideas thesis




causality according to the laws of nature is not the only causality operating

to originate the phenomena of the world a causality of freedom is also

necessary to account fully for these phenomena




proof




let it be supposed that there is no other kind of causality than that

according to the laws of nature consequently everything that happens

presupposes a previous condition which it follows with absolute certainty in

conformity with a rule but this previous condition must itself be something

that has happened that has arisen in time as it did not exist before for

if it has always been in existence its consequence or effect would not thus

originate for the first time but would likewise have always existed the

causality therefore of a cause whereby something happens is itself a thing

that has happened now this again presupposes in conformity with the law of

nature a previous condition and its causality and this another anterior to

the former and so on if then everything happens solely in accordance with

the laws of nature there cannot be any real first beginning of things but

only a subaltern or comparative beginning there cannot therefore be a

completeness of series on the side of the causes which originate the one from

the other but the law of nature is that nothing can happen without a

sufficient  priori determined cause the proposition thereforeif all

causality is possible only in accordance with the laws of natureis when

stated in this unlimited and general manner selfcontradictory it follows

that this cannot be the only kind of causality




from what has been said it follows that a causality must be admitted by means

of which something happens without its cause being determined according to

necessary laws by some other cause preceding that is to say there must exist

an absolute spontaneity of cause which of itself originates a series of

phenomena which proceeds according to natural lawsconsequently

transcendental freedom without which even in the course of nature the

succession of phenomena on the side of causes is never complete




antithesis




there is no such thing as freedom but everything in the world happens solely

according to the laws of nature




proof




granted that there does exist freedom in the transcendental sense as a

peculiar kind of causality operating to produce events in the worlda

faculty that is to say of originating a state and consequently a series of

consequences from that state in this case not only the series originated by

this spontaneity but the determination of this spontaneity itself to the

production of the series that is to say the causality itself must have an

absolute commencement such that nothing can precede to determine this action

according to unvarying laws but every beginning of action presupposes in the

acting cause a state of inaction and a dynamically primal beginning of action

presupposes a state which has no connectionas regards

causalitywith the preceding state of the causewhich does not

that is in any wise result from it transcendental freedom is therefore

opposed to the natural law of cause and effect and such a conjunction of

successive states in effective causes is destructive of the possibility of

unity in experience and for that reason not to be found in experienceis

consequently a mere fiction of thought




we have therefore nothing but nature to which we must look for connection and

order in cosmical events freedomindependence of the laws of

natureis certainly a deliverance from restraint but it is also a

relinquishing of the guidance of law and rule for it cannot be alleged that

instead of the laws of nature laws of freedom may be introduced into the

causality of the course of nature for if freedom were determined according to

laws it would be no longer freedom but merely nature nature therefore and

transcendental freedom are distinguishable as conformity to law and

lawlessness the former imposes upon understanding the difficulty of seeking

the origin of events ever higher and higher in the series of causes inasmuch

as causality is always conditioned thereby while it compensates this labour by

the guarantee of a unity complete and in conformity with law the latter on

the contrary holds out to the understanding the promise of a point of rest in

the chain of causes by conducting it to an unconditioned causality which

professes to have the power of spontaneous origination but which in its own

utter blindness deprives it of the guidance of rules by which alone a

completely connected experience is possible




observations on the third antinomy on the thesis




the transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the entire content

of the psychological conception so termed which is for the most part

empirical it merely presents us with the conception of spontaneity of action

as the proper ground for imputing freedom to the cause of a certain class of

objects it is however the true stumblingstone to philosophy which meets

with unconquerable difficulties in the way of its admitting this kind of

unconditioned causality that element in the question of the freedom of the

will which has for so long a time placed speculative reason in such

perplexity is properly only transcendental and concerns the question whether

there must be held to exist a faculty of spontaneous origination of a series of

successive things or states how such a faculty is possible is not a necessary

inquiry for in the case of natural causality itself we are obliged to content

ourselves with the  priori knowledge that such a causality must be

presupposed although we are quite incapable of comprehending how the being of

one thing is possible through the being of another but must for this

information look entirely to experience now we have demonstrated this

necessity of a free first beginning of a series of phenomena only in so far as

it is required for the comprehension of an origin of the world all following

states being regarded as a succession according to laws of nature alone but

as there has thus been proved the existence of a faculty which can of itself

originate a series in timealthough we are unable to explain how it can

existwe feel ourselves authorized to admit even in the midst of the

natural course of events a beginning as regards causality of different

successions of phenomena and at the same time to attribute to all substances a

faculty of free action but we ought in this case not to allow ourselves to

fall into a common misunderstanding and to suppose that because a successive

series in the world can only have a comparatively first beginninganother

state or condition of things always precedingan absolutely first

beginning of a series in the course of nature is impossible for we are not

speaking here of an absolutely first beginning in relation to time but as

regards causality alone when for example i completely of my own free will

and independently of the necessarily determinative influence of natural causes

rise from my chair there commences with this event including its material

consequences in infinitum an absolutely new series although in relation to

time this event is merely the continuation of a preceding series for this

resolution and act of mine do not form part of the succession of effects in

nature and are not mere continuations of it on the contrary the determining

causes of nature cease to operate in reference to this event which certainly

succeeds the acts of nature but does not proceed from them for these reasons

the action of a free agent must be termed in regard to causality if not in

relation to time an absolutely primal beginning of a series of phenomena




the justification of this need of reason to rest upon a free act as the first

beginning of the series of natural causes is evident from the fact that all

philosophers of antiquity with the exception of the epicurean school felt

themselves obliged when constructing a theory of the motions of the universe

to accept a prime mover that is a freely acting cause which spontaneously

and prior to all other causes evolved this series of states they always felt

the need of going beyond mere nature for the purpose of making a first

beginning comprehensible




on the antithesis




the assertor of the allsufficiency of nature in regard to causality

transcendental physiocracy in opposition to the doctrine of freedom would

defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner he would say

in answer to the sophistical arguments of the opposite party if you do not

accept a mathematical first in relation to time you have no need to seek a

dynamical first in regard to causality who compelled you to imagine an

absolutely primal condition of the world and therewith an absolute beginning

of the gradually progressing successions of phenomenaand as some

foundation for this fancy of yours to set bounds to unlimited nature inasmuch

as the substances in the world have always existedat least the unity of

experience renders such a supposition quite necessarythere is no

difficulty in believing also that the changes in the conditions of these

substances have always existed and consequently that a first beginning

mathematical or dynamical is by no means required the possibility of such an

infinite derivation without any initial member from which all the others

result is certainly quite incomprehensible but if you are rash enough to

deny the enigmatical secrets of nature for this reason you will find

yourselves obliged to deny also the existence of many fundamental properties of

natural objects such as fundamental forces which you can just as little

comprehend and even the possibility of so simple a conception as that of

change must present to you insuperable difficulties for if experience did not

teach you that it was real you never could conceive  priori the possibility

of this ceaseless sequence of being and nonbeing




but if the existence of a transcendental faculty of freedom is granteda

faculty of originating changes in the worldthis faculty must at least

exist out of and apart from the world although it is certainly a bold

assumption that over and above the complete content of all possible

intuitions there still exists an object which cannot be presented in any

possible perception but to attribute to substances in the world itself such a

faculty is quite inadmissible for in this case the connection of phenomena

reciprocally determining and determined according to general laws which is

termed nature and along with it the criteria of empirical truth which enable

us to distinguish experience from mere visionary dreaming would almost

entirely disappear in proximity with such a lawless faculty of freedom a

system of nature is hardly cogitable for the laws of the latter would be

continually subject to the intrusive influences of the former and the course

of phenomena which would otherwise proceed regularly and uniformly would

become thereby confused and disconnected




fourth conflict of the transcendental ideas thesis




there exists either in or in connection with the worldeither as a part

of it or as the cause of itan absolutely necessary being




proof




the world of sense as the sum total of all phenomena contains a series of

changes for without such a series the mental representation of the series of

time itself as the condition of the possibility of the sensuous world could

not be presented to us55 but every change stands under its

condition which precedes it in time and renders it necessary now the

existence of a given condition presupposes a complete series of conditions up

to the absolutely unconditioned which alone is absolutely necessary it

follows that something that is absolutely necessary must exist if change

exists as its consequence but this necessary thing itself belongs to the

sensuous world for suppose it to exist out of and apart from it the series of

cosmical changes would receive from it a beginning and yet this necessary

cause would not itself belong to the world of sense but this is impossible

for as the beginning of a series in time is determined only by that which

precedes it in time the supreme condition of the beginning of a series of

changes must exist in the time in which this series itself did not exist for a

beginning supposes a time preceding in which the thing that begins to be was

not in existence the causality of the necessary cause of changes and

consequently the cause itself must for these reasons belong to timeand

to phenomena time being possible only as the form of phenomena consequently

it cannot be cogitated as separated from the world of sensethe sum total

of all phenomena there is therefore contained in the world something that

is absolutely necessarywhether it be the whole cosmical series itself

or only a part of it



 55

objectively time as the formal condition of the possibility of change

precedes all changes but subjectively and in consciousness the

representation of time like every other is given solely by occasion of

perception




antithesis




an absolutely necessary being does not exist either in the world or out of

itas its cause




proof




grant that either the world itself is necessary or that there is contained in

it a necessary existence two cases are possible first there must either be

in the series of cosmical changes a beginning which is unconditionally

necessary and therefore uncausedwhich is at variance with the dynamical

law of the determination of all phenomena in time or secondly the series

itself is without beginning and although contingent and conditioned in all

its parts is nevertheless absolutely necessary and unconditioned as a

wholewhich is selfcontradictory for the existence of an aggregate

cannot be necessary if no single part of it possesses necessary existence




grant on the other hand that an absolutely necessary cause exists out of and

apart from the world this cause as the highest member in the series of the

causes of cosmical changes must originate or begin56 the existence of

the latter and their series in this case it must also begin to act and its

causality would therefore belong to time and consequently to the sum total of

phenomena that is to the world it follows that the cause cannot be out of

the world which is contradictory to the hypothesis therefore neither in the

world nor out of it but in causal connection with it does there exist any

absolutely necessary being



 56

the word begin is taken in two senses the first is activethe cause

being regarded as beginning a series of conditions as its effect infit the

second is passivethe causality in the cause itself beginning to operate

fit i reason here from the first to the second




observations on the fourth antinomy on the thesis




to demonstrate the existence of a necessary being i cannot be permitted in

this place to employ any other than the cosmological argument which ascends

from the conditioned in phenomena to the unconditioned in conceptionthe

unconditioned being considered the necessary condition of the absolute totality

of the series the proof from the mere idea of a supreme being belongs to

another principle of reason and requires separate discussion




the pure cosmological proof demonstrates the existence of a necessary being

but at the same time leaves it quite unsettled whether this being is the world

itself or quite distinct from it to establish the truth of the latter view

principles are requisite which are not cosmological and do not proceed in the

series of phenomena we should require to introduce into our proof conceptions

of contingent beingsregarded merely as objects of the understanding and

also a principle which enables us to connect these by means of mere

conceptions with a necessary being but the proper place for all such

arguments is a transcendent philosophy which has unhappily not yet been

established




but if we begin our proof cosmologically by laying at the foundation of it

the series of phenomena and the regress in it according to empirical laws of

causality we are not at liberty to break off from this mode of demonstration

and to pass over to something which is not itself a member of the series the

condition must be taken in exactly the same signification as the relation of

the conditioned to its condition in the series has been taken for the series

must conduct us in an unbroken regress to this supreme condition but if this

relation is sensuous and belongs to the possible empirical employment of

understanding the supreme condition or cause must close the regressive series

according to the laws of sensibility and consequently must belong to the

series of time it follows that this necessary existence must be regarded as

the highest member of the cosmical series




certain philosophers have nevertheless allowed themselves the liberty of

making such a saltus metabasis eis allo gonos from the changes in the world

they have concluded their empirical contingency that is their dependence on

empiricallydetermined causes and they thus admitted an ascending series of

empirical conditions and in this they are quite right but as they could not

find in this series any primal beginning or any highest member they passed

suddenly from the empirical conception of contingency to the pure category

which presents us with a seriesnot sensuous but

intellectualwhose completeness does certainly rest upon the existence of

an absolutely necessary cause nay more this intellectual series is not tied

to any sensuous conditions and is therefore free from the condition of time

which requires it spontaneously to begin its causality in time but such a

procedure is perfectly inadmissible as will be made plain from what follows




in the pure sense of the categories that is contingent the contradictory

opposite of which is possible now we cannot reason from empirical contingency

to intellectual the opposite of that which is changedthe opposite of

its stateis actual at another time and is therefore possible

consequently it is not the contradictory opposite of the former state to be

that it is necessary that in the same time in which the preceding state

existed its opposite could have existed in its place but such a cognition is

not given us in the mere phenomenon of change a body that was in motion  a

comes into a state of rest  nona now it cannot be concluded from the fact

that a state opposite to the state a follows it that the contradictory

opposite of a is possible and that a is therefore contingent to prove this

we should require to know that the state of rest could have existed in the very

same time in which the motion took place now we know nothing more than that

the state of rest was actual in the time that followed the state of motion

consequently that it was also possible but motion at one time and rest at

another time are not contradictorily opposed to each other it follows from

what has been said that the succession of opposite determinations that is

change does not demonstrate the fact of contingency as represented in the

conceptions of the pure understanding and that it cannot therefore conduct

us to the fact of the existence of a necessary being change proves merely

empirical contingency that is to say that the new state could not have

existed without a cause which belongs to the preceding time this

causeeven although it is regarded as absolutely necessarymust be

presented to us in time and must belong to the series of phenomena




on the antithesis




the difficulties which meet us in our attempt to rise through the series of

phenomena to the existence of an absolutely necessary supreme cause must not

originate from our inability to establish the truth of our mere conceptions of

the necessary existence of a thing that is to say our objections not be

ontological but must be directed against the causal connection with a series

of phenomena of a condition which is itself unconditioned in one word they

must be cosmological and relate to empirical laws we must show that the

regress in the series of causes in the world of sense cannot conclude with an

empirically unconditioned condition and that the cosmological argument from

the contingency of the cosmical statea contingency alleged to arise from

changedoes not justify us in accepting a first cause that is a prime

originator of the cosmical series




the reader will observe in this antinomy a very remarkable contrast the very

same grounds of proof which established in the thesis the existence of a

supreme being demonstrated in the antithesisand with equal

strictnessthe nonexistence of such a being we found first that a

necessary being exists because the whole time past contains the series of all

conditions and with it therefore the unconditioned the necessary

secondly that there does not exist any necessary being for the same reason

that the whole time past contains the series of all conditionswhich are

themselves therefore in the aggregate conditioned the cause of this seeming

incongruity is as follows we attend in the first argument solely to the

absolute totality of the series of conditions the one of which determines the

other in time and thus arrive at a necessary unconditioned in the second we

consider on the contrary the contingency of everything that is determined in

the series of timefor every event is preceded by a time in which the

condition itself must be determined as conditionedand thus everything

that is unconditioned or absolutely necessary disappears in both the mode of

proof is quite in accordance with the common procedure of human reason which

often falls into discord with itself from considering an object from two

different points of view herr von mairan regarded the controversy between two

celebrated astronomers which arose from a similar difficulty as to the choice

of a proper standpoint as a phenomenon of sufficient importance to warrant a

separate treatise on the subject the one concluded the moon revolves on its

own axis because it constantly presents the same side to the earth the other

declared that the moon does not revolve on its own axis for the same reason

both conclusions were perfectly correct according to the point of view from

which the motions of the moon were considered


section iii of the interest of reason in these

selfcontradictions


we have thus completely before us the dialectical procedure of the cosmological

ideas no possible experience can present us with an object adequate to them in

extent nay more reason itself cannot cogitate them as according with the

general laws of experience and yet they are not arbitrary fictions of thought

on the contrary reason in its uninterrupted progress in the empirical

synthesis is necessarily conducted to them when it endeavours to free from

all conditions and to comprehend in its unconditioned totality that which can

only be determined conditionally in accordance with the laws of experience

these dialectical propositions are so many attempts to solve four natural and

unavoidable problems of reason there are neither more nor can there be less

than this number because there are no other series of synthetical hypotheses

limiting  priori the empirical synthesis




the brilliant claims of reason striving to extend its dominion beyond the

limits of experience have been represented above only in dry formulae which

contain merely the grounds of its pretensions they have besides in

conformity with the character of a transcendental philosophy been freed from

every empirical element although the full splendour of the promises they hold

out and the anticipations they excite manifests itself only when in

connection with empirical cognitions in the application of them however and

in the advancing enlargement of the employment of reason while struggling to

rise from the region of experience and to soar to those sublime ideas

philosophy discovers a value and a dignity which if it could but make good

its assertions would raise it far above all other departments of human

knowledgeprofessing as it does to present a sure foundation for our

highest hopes and the ultimate aims of all the exertions of reason the

questions whether the world has a beginning and a limit to its extension in

space whether there exists anywhere or perhaps in my own thinking self an

indivisible and indestructible unityor whether nothing but what is

divisible and transitory exists whether i am a free agent or like other

beings am bound in the chains of nature and fate whether finally there is a

supreme cause of the world or all our thought and speculation must end with

nature and the order of external thingsare questions for the solution of

which the mathematician would willingly exchange his whole science for in it

there is no satisfaction for the highest aspirations and most ardent desires of

humanity nay it may even be said that the true value of

mathematicsthat pride of human reasonconsists in this that she

guides reason to the knowledge of naturein her greater as well as in her

less manifestationsin her beautiful order and regularityguides

her moreover to an insight into the wonderful unity of the moving forces in

the operations of nature far beyond the expectations of a philosophy building

only on experience and that she thus encourages philosophy to extend the

province of reason beyond all experience and at the same time provides it with

the most excellent materials for supporting its investigations in so far as

their nature admits by adequate and accordant intuitions




unfortunately for speculationbut perhaps fortunately for the practical

interests of humanityreason in the midst of her highest anticipations

finds herself hemmed in by a press of opposite and contradictory conclusions

from which neither her honour nor her safety will permit her to draw back nor

can she regard these conflicting trains of reasoning with indifference as mere

passages at arms still less can she command peace for in the subject of the

conflict she has a deep interest there is no other course left open to her

than to reflect with herself upon the origin of this disunion in

reasonwhether it may not arise from a mere misunderstanding after such

an inquiry arrogant claims would have to be given up on both sides but the

sovereignty of reason over understanding and sense would be based upon a sure

foundation




we shall at present defer this radical inquiry and in the meantime consider

for a little what side in the controversy we should most willingly take if we

were obliged to become partisans at all as in this case we leave out of

sight altogether the logical criterion of truth and merely consult our own

interest in reference to the question these considerations although

inadequate to settle the question of right in either party will enable us to

comprehend how those who have taken part in the struggle adopt the one view

rather than the otherno special insight into the subject however

having influenced their choice they will at the same time explain to us many

other things by the wayfor example the fiery zeal on the one side and

the cold maintenance of their cause on the other why the one party has met

with the warmest approbations and the other has always been repulsed by

irreconcilable prejudices




there is one thing however that determines the proper point of view from

which alone this preliminary inquiry can be instituted and carried on with the

proper completenessand that is the comparison of the principles from

which both sides thesis and antithesis proceed my readers would remark in

the propositions of the antithesis a complete uniformity in the mode of thought

and a perfect unity of principle its principle was that of pure empiricism

not only in the explication of the phenomena in the world but also in the

solution of the transcendental ideas even of that of the universe itself the

affirmations of the thesis on the contrary were based in addition to the

empirical mode of explanation employed in the series of phenomena on

intellectual propositions and its principles were in so far not simple i

shall term the thesis in view of its essential characteristic the dogmatism

of pure reason




on the side of dogmatism or of the thesis therefore in the determination of

the cosmological ideas we find




1 a practical interest which must be very dear to every rightthinking man

that the word has a beginningthat the nature of my thinking self is

simple and therefore indestructiblethat i am a free agent and raised

above the compulsion of nature and her lawsand finally that the entire

order of things which form the world is dependent upon a supreme being from

whom the whole receives unity and connectionthese are so many

foundationstones of morality and religion the antithesis deprives us of all

these supportsor at least seems so to deprive us




2 a speculative interest of reason manifests itself on this side for if we

take the transcendental ideas and employ them in the manner which the thesis

directs we can exhibit completely  priori the entire chain of conditions and

understand the derivation of the conditionedbeginning from the

unconditioned this the antithesis does not do and for this reason does not

meet with so welcome a reception for it can give no answer to our question

respecting the conditions of its synthesisexcept such as must be

supplemented by another question and so on to infinity according to it we

must rise from a given beginning to one still higher every part conducts us to

a still smaller one every event is preceded by another event which is its

cause and the conditions of existence rest always upon other and still higher

conditions and find neither end nor basis in some selfsubsistent thing as the

primal being




3 this side has also the advantage of popularity and this constitutes no

small part of its claim to favour the common understanding does not find the

least difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning of all

synthesisaccustomed as it is rather to follow our consequences than to

seek for a proper basis for cognition in the conception of an absolute first

moreoverthe possibility of which it does not inquire intoit is

highly gratified to find a firmlyestablished point of departure for its

attempts at theory while in the restless and continuous ascent from the

conditioned to the condition always with one foot in the air it can find no

satisfaction




on the side of the antithesis or empiricism in the determination of the

cosmological ideas




1 we cannot discover any such practical interest arising from pure principles

of reason as morality and religion present on the contrary pure empiricism

seems to empty them of all their power and influence if there does not exist a

supreme being distinct from the worldif the world is without beginning

consequently without a creatorif our wills are not free and the soul is

divisible and subject to corruption just like matterthe ideas and

principles of morality lose all validity and fall with the transcendental ideas

which constituted their theoretical support




2 but empiricism in compensation holds out to reason in its speculative

interests certain important advantages far exceeding any that the dogmatist

can promise us for when employed by the empiricist understanding is always

upon its proper ground of investigationthe field of possible experience

the laws of which it can explore and thus extend its cognition securely and

with clear intelligence without being stopped by limits in any direction here

can it and ought it to find and present to intuition its proper

objectnot only in itself but in all its relations or if it employ

conceptions upon this ground it can always present the corresponding images in

clear and unmistakable intuitions it is quite unnecessary for it to renounce

the guidance of nature to attach itself to ideas the objects of which it

cannot know because as mere intellectual entities they cannot be presented

in any intuition on the contrary it is not even permitted to abandon its

proper occupation under the pretence that it has been brought to a conclusion

for it never can be and to pass into the region of idealizing reason and

transcendent conceptions which it is not required to observe and explore the

laws of nature but merely to think and to imaginesecure from being

contradicted by facts because they have not been called as witnesses but

passed by or perhaps subordinated to the socalled higher interests and

considerations of pure reason




hence the empiricist will never allow himself to accept any epoch of nature for

the firstthe absolutely primal state he will not believe that there can

be limits to his outlook into her wide domains nor pass from the objects of

nature which he can satisfactorily explain by means of observation and

mathematical thoughtwhich he can determine synthetically in intuition

to those which neither sense nor imagination can ever present in concreto he

will not concede the existence of a faculty in nature operating independently

of the laws of naturea concession which would introduce uncertainty into

the procedure of the understanding which is guided by necessary laws to the

observation of phenomena nor finally will he permit himself to seek a cause

beyond nature inasmuch as we know nothing but it and from it alone receive an

objective basis for all our conceptions and instruction in the unvarying laws

of things




in truth if the empirical philosopher had no other purpose in the

establishment of his antithesis than to check the presumption of a reason which

mistakes its true destination which boasts of its insight and its knowledge

just where all insight and knowledge cease to exist and regards that which is

valid only in relation to a practical interest as an advancement of the

speculative interests of the mind in order when it is convenient for itself

to break the thread of our physical investigations and under pretence of

extending our cognition connect them with transcendental ideas by means of

which we really know only that we know nothingif i say the empiricist

rested satisfied with this benefit the principle advanced by him would be a

maxim recommending moderation in the pretensions of reason and modesty in its

affirmations and at the same time would direct us to the right mode of

extending the province of the understanding by the help of the only true

teacher experience in obedience to this advice intellectual hypotheses and

faith would not be called in aid of our practical interests nor should we

introduce them under the pompous titles of science and insight for speculative

cognition cannot find an objective basis any other where than in experience

and when we overstep its limits our synthesis which requires ever new

cognitions independent of experience has no substratum of intuition upon which

to build




but ifas often happensempiricism in relation to ideas becomes

itself dogmatic and boldly denies that which is above the sphere of its

phenomenal cognition it falls itself into the error of intemperancean

error which is here all the more reprehensible as thereby the practical

interest of reason receives an irreparable injury




and this constitutes the opposition between epicureanism57 and platonism



 57

it is however still a matter of doubt whether epicurus ever propounded these

principles as directions for the objective employment of the understanding if

indeed they were nothing more than maxims for the speculative exercise of

reason he gives evidence therein a more genuine philosophic spirit than any of

the philosophers of antiquity that in the explanation of phenomena we must

proceed as if the field of inquiry had neither limits in space nor commencement

in time that we must be satisfied with the teaching of experience in reference

to the material of which the world is posed that we must not look for any

other mode of the origination of events than that which is determined by the

unalterable laws of nature and finally that we not employ the hypothesis of a

cause distinct from the world to account for a phenomenon or for the world

itselfare principles for the extension of speculative philosophy and

the discovery of the true sources of the principles of morals which however

little conformed to in the present day are undoubtedly correct at the same

time any one desirous of ignoring in mere speculation these dogmatical

propositions need not for that reason be accused of denying them




both epicurus and plato assert more in their systems than they know the former

encourages and advances sciencealthough to the prejudice of the

practical the latter presents us with excellent principles for the

investigation of the practical but in relation to everything regarding which

we can attain to speculative cognition permits reason to append idealistic

explanations of natural phenomena to the great injury of physical

investigation




3 in regard to the third motive for the preliminary choice of a party in this

war of assertions it seems very extraordinary that empiricism should be

utterly unpopular we should be inclined to believe that the common

understanding would receive it with pleasurepromising as it does to

satisfy it without passing the bounds of experience and its connected order

while transcendental dogmatism obliges it to rise to conceptions which far

surpass the intelligence and ability of the most practised thinkers but in

this in truth is to be found its real motive for the common understanding

thus finds itself in a situation where not even the most learned can have the

advantage of it if it understands little or nothing about these transcendental

conceptions no one can boast of understanding any more and although it may

not express itself in so scholastically correct a manner as others it can busy

itself with reasoning and arguments without end wandering among mere ideas

about which one can always be very eloquent because we know nothing about

them while in the observation and investigation of nature it would be forced

to remain dumb and to confess its utter ignorance thus indolence and vanity

form of themselves strong recommendations of these principles besides

although it is a hard thing for a philosopher to assume a principle of which

he can give to himself no reasonable account and still more to employ

conceptions the objective reality of which cannot be established nothing is

more usual with the common understanding it wants something which will allow

it to go to work with confidence the difficulty of even comprehending a

supposition does not disquiet it becausenot knowing what comprehending

meansit never even thinks of the supposition it may be adopting as a

principle and regards as known that with which it has become familiar from

constant use and at last all speculative interests disappear before the

practical interests which it holds dear and it fancies that it understands and

knows what its necessities and hopes incite it to assume or to believe thus

the empiricism of transcendentally idealizing reason is robbed of all

popularity and however prejudicial it may be to the highest practical

principles there is no fear that it will ever pass the limits of the schools

or acquire any favour or influence in society or with the multitude




human reason is by nature architectonic that is to say it regards all

cognitions as parts of a possible system and hence accepts only such

principles as at least do not incapacitate a cognition to which we may have

attained from being placed along with others in a general system but the

propositions of the antithesis are of a character which renders the completion

of an edifice of cognitions impossible according to these beyond one state or

epoch of the world there is always to be found one more ancient in every part

always other parts themselves divisible preceding every event another the

origin of which must itself be sought still higher and everything in existence

is conditioned and still not dependent on an unconditioned and primal

existence as therefore the antithesis will not concede the existence of a

first beginning which might be available as a foundation a complete edifice of

cognition in the presence of such hypothesis is utterly impossible thus the

architectonic interest of reason which requires a unitynot empirical

but  priori and rationalforms a natural recommendation for the

assertions of the thesis in our antinomy




but if any one could free himself entirely from all considerations of interest

and weigh without partiality the assertions of reason attending only to their

content irrespective of the consequences which follow from them such a

person on the supposition that he knew no other way out of the confusion than

to settle the truth of one or other of the conflicting doctrines would live in

a state of continual hesitation today he would feel convinced that the human

will is free tomorrow considering the indissoluble chain of nature he would

look on freedom as a mere illusion and declare nature to be allinall but if

he were called to action the play of the merely speculative reason would

disappear like the shapes of a dream and practical interest would dictate his

choice of principles but as it well befits a reflective and inquiring being

to devote certain periods of time to the examination of its own reasonto

divest itself of all partiality and frankly to communicate its observations

for the judgement and opinion of others so no one can be blamed for much less

prevented from placing both parties on their trial with permission to end

themselves free from intimidation before intimidation before a sworn jury of

equal condition with themselvesthe condition of weak and fallible men


section iv of the necessity imposed upon pure reason

of presenting a solution of its transcendental problems


to avow an ability to solve all problems and to answer all questions would be a

profession certain to convict any philosopher of extravagant boasting and

selfconceit and at once to destroy the confidence that might otherwise have

been reposed in him there are however sciences so constituted that every

question arising within their sphere must necessarily be capable of receiving

an answer from the knowledge already possessed for the answer must be received

from the same sources whence the question arose in such sciences it is not

allowable to excuse ourselves on the plea of necessary and unavoidable

ignorance a solution is absolutely requisite the rule of right and wrong must

help us to the knowledge of what is right or wrong in all possible cases

otherwise the idea of obligation or duty would be utterly null for we cannot

have any obligation to that which we cannot know on the other hand in our

investigations of the phenomena of nature much must remain uncertain and many

questions continue insoluble because what we know of nature is far from being

sufficient to explain all the phenomena that are presented to our observation

now the question is whether there is in transcendental philosophy any

question relating to an object presented to pure reason which is unanswerable

by this reason and whether we must regard the subject of the question as quite

uncertain so far as our knowledge extends and must give it a place among

those subjects of which we have just so much conception as is sufficient to

enable us to raise a questionfaculty or materials failing us however

when we attempt an answer




now i maintain that among all speculative cognition the peculiarity of

transcendental philosophy is that there is no question relating to an object

presented to pure reason which is insoluble by this reason and that the

profession of unavoidable ignorancethe problem being alleged to be

beyond the reach of our facultiescannot free us from the obligation to

present a complete and satisfactory answer for the very conception which

enables us to raise the question must give us the power of answering it

inasmuch as the object as in the case of right and wrong is not to be

discovered out of the conception




but in transcendental philosophy it is only the cosmological questions to

which we can demand a satisfactory answer in relation to the constitution of

their object and the philosopher is not permitted to avail himself of the

pretext of necessary ignorance and impenetrable obscurity these questions

relate solely to the cosmological ideas for the object must be given in

experience and the question relates to the adequateness of the object to an

idea if the object is transcendental and therefore itself unknown if the

question for example is whether the objectthe something the

phenomenon of which internalin ourselves is thoughtthat is to

say the soul is in itself a simple being or whether there is a cause of all

things which is absolutely necessaryin such cases we are seeking for

our idea an object of which we may confess that it is unknown to us though we

must not on that account assert that it is impossible58 the cosmological

ideas alone posses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them

and the empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object to be

given and the question which arises from these ideas relates merely to the

progress of this synthesis in so far as it must contain absolute

totalitywhich however is not empirical as it cannot be given in any

experience now as the question here is solely in regard to a thing as the

object of a possible experience and not as a thing in itself the answer to the

transcendental cosmological question need not be sought out of the idea for

the question does not regard an object in itself the question in relation to a

possible experience is not what can be given in an experience in

concreto but what is contained in the idea to which the

empirical synthesis must approximate the question must therefore be

capable of solution from the idea alone for the idea is a creation of reason

itself which therefore cannot disclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to

the unknown object



 58

the question what is the constitution of a transcendental

object is unanswerablewe are unable to say what it is but we

can perceive that the question itself is nothing because it does not relate to

any object that can be presented to us for this reason we must consider all

the questions raised in transcendental psychology as answerable and as really

answered for they relate to the transcendental subject of all internal

phenomena which is not itself phenomenon and consequently not given as an

object in which moreover none of the categoriesand it is to them that

the question is properly directedfind any conditions of its application

here therefore is a case where no answer is the only proper answer for a

question regarding the constitution of a something which cannot be cogitated by

any determined predicate being completely beyond the sphere of objects and

experience is perfectly null and void




it is not so extraordinary as it at first sight appears that a science should

demand and expect satisfactory answers to all the questions that may arise

within its own sphere questiones domesticae although up to a certain time

these answers may not have been discovered there are in addition to

transcendental philosophy only two pure sciences of reason the one with a

speculative the other with a practical contentpure mathematics and pure

ethics has any one ever heard it alleged that from our complete and necessary

ignorance of the conditions it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter

of a circle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers by the

former the sum cannot be given exactly by the latter only approximately and

therefore we decide that the impossibility of a solution of the question is

evident lambert presented us with a demonstration of this in the general

principles of morals there can be nothing uncertain for the propositions are

either utterly without meaning or must originate solely in our rational

conceptions on the other hand there must be in physical science an infinite

number of conjectures which can never become certainties because the

phenomena of nature are not given as objects dependent on our conceptions the

key to the solution of such questions cannot therefore be found in our

conceptions or in pure thought but must lie without us and for that reason is

in many cases not to be discovered and consequently a satisfactory explanation

cannot be expected the questions of transcendental analytic which relate to

the deduction of our pure cognition are not to be regarded as of the same kind

as those mentioned above for we are not at present treating of the certainty

of judgements in relation to the origin of our conceptions but only of that

certainty in relation to objects




we cannot therefore escape the responsibility of at least a critical solution

of the questions of reason by complaints of the limited nature of our

faculties and the seemingly humble confession that it is beyond the power of

our reason to decide whether the world has existed from all eternity or had a

beginningwhether it is infinitely extended or enclosed within certain

limitswhether anything in the world is simple or whether everything

must be capable of infinite divisibilitywhether freedom can originate

phenomena or whether everything is absolutely dependent on the laws and order

of natureand finally whether there exists a being that is completely

unconditioned and necessary or whether the existence of everything is

conditioned and consequently dependent on something external to itself and

therefore in its own nature contingent for all these questions relate to an

object which can be given nowhere else than in thought this object is the

absolutely unconditioned totality of the synthesis of phenomena if the

conceptions in our minds do not assist us to some certain result in regard to

these problems we must not defend ourselves on the plea that the object itself

remains hidden from and unknown to us for no such thing or object can be

givenit is not to be found out of the idea in our minds we must seek

the cause of our failure in our idea itself which is an insoluble problem and

in regard to which we obstinately assume that there exists a real object

corresponding and adequate to it a clear explanation of the dialectic which

lies in our conception will very soon enable us to come to a satisfactory

decision in regard to such a question




the pretext that we are unable to arrive at certainty in regard to these

problems may be met with this question which requires at least a plain answer

from what source do the ideas originate the solution of which involves

you in such difficulties are you seeking for an explanation of certain

phenomena and do you expect these ideas to give you the principles or the

rules of this explanation let it be granted that all nature was laid

open before you that nothing was hid from your senses and your consciousness

still you could not cognize in concreto the object of your ideas in any

experience for what is demanded is not only this full and complete intuition

but also a complete synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality

and this is not possible by means of any empirical cognition it follows that

your questionyour ideais by no means necessary for the

explanation of any phenomenon and the idea cannot have been in any sense given

by the object itself for such an object can never be presented to us because

it cannot be given by any possible experience whatever perceptions you may

attain to you are still surrounded by conditionsin space or in

timeand you cannot discover anything unconditioned nor can you decide

whether this unconditioned is to be placed in an absolute beginning of the

synthesis or in an absolute totality of the series without beginning a whole

in the empirical signification of the term is always merely comparative the

absolute whole of quantity the universe of division of derivation of the

condition of existence with the questionwhether it is to be produced by

finite or infinite synthesis no possible experience can instruct us

concerning you will not for example be able to explain the phenomena of a

body in the least degree better whether you believe it to consist of simple

or of composite parts for a simple phenomenonand just as little an

infinite series of compositioncan never be presented to your perception

phenomena require and admit of explanation only in so far as the conditions of

that explanation are given in perception but the sum total of that which is

given in phenomena considered as an absolute whole is itself a

perceptionand we cannot therefore seek for explanations of this whole

beyond itself in other perceptions the explanation of this whole is the

proper object of the transcendental problems of pure reason




although therefore the solution of these problems is unattainable through

experience we must not permit ourselves to say that it is uncertain how the

object of our inquiries is constituted for the object is in our own mind and

cannot be discovered in experience and we have only to take care that our

thoughts are consistent with each other and to avoid falling into the

amphiboly of regarding our idea as a representation of an object empirically

given and therefore to be cognized according to the laws of experience a

dogmatical solution is therefore not only unsatisfactory but impossible the

critical solution which may be a perfectly certain one does not consider the

question objectively but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of the cognition

upon which the question rests


section v sceptical exposition of the cosmological

problems presented in the four transcendental ideas


we should be quite willing to desist from the demand of a dogmatical answer to

our questions if we understood beforehand that be the answer what it may it

would only serve to increase our ignorance to throw us from one

incomprehensibility into another from one obscurity into another still

greater and perhaps lead us into irreconcilable contradictions if a

dogmatical affirmative or negative answer is demanded is it at all prudent to

set aside the probable grounds of a solution which lie before us and to take

into consideration what advantage we shall gain if the answer is to favour the

one side or the other if it happens that in both cases the answer is mere

nonsense we have in this an irresistible summons to institute a critical

investigation of the question for the purpose of discovering whether it is

based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea the falsity of

which would be more easily exposed in its application and consequences than in

the mere representation of its content this is the great utility of the

sceptical mode of treating the questions addressed by pure reason to itself by

this method we easily rid ourselves of the confusions of dogmatism and

establish in its place a temperate criticism which as a genuine cathartic

will successfully remove the presumptuous notions of philosophy and their

consequencethe vain pretension to universal science




if then i could understand the nature of a cosmological idea and perceive

before i entered on the discussion of the subject at all that whatever side

of the question regarding the unconditioned of the regressive synthesis of

phenomena it favouredit must either be too great or too small for every

conception of the understandingi would be able to comprehend how the

idea which relates to an object of experiencean experience which must

be adequate to and in accordance with a possible conception of the

understandingmust be completely void and without significance inasmuch

as its object is inadequate consider it as we may and this is actually the

case with all cosmological conceptions which for the reason above mentioned

involve reason so long as it remains attached to them in an unavoidable

antinomy for suppose




first that the world has no beginningin this case it is too large for

our conception for this conception which consists in a successive regress

cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed grant that it has a

beginning it is then too small for the conception of the understanding for

as a beginning presupposes a time preceding it cannot be unconditioned and

the law of the empirical employment of the understanding imposes the necessity

of looking for a higher condition of time and the world is therefore

evidently too small for this law




the same is the case with the double answer to the question regarding the

extent in space of the world for if it is infinite and unlimited it must

be too large for every possible empirical conception if it is finite and

limited we have a right to ask what determines these limits

void space is not a selfsubsistent correlate of things and cannot be a final

conditionand still less an empirical condition forming a part of a

possible experience for how can we have any experience or perception of an

absolute void but the absolute totality of the empirical synthesis requires

that the unconditioned be an empirical conception consequently a finite world

is too small for our conception




secondly if every phenomenon matter in space consists of an infinite number

of parts the regress of the division is always too great for our conception

and if the division of space must cease with some member of the division the

simple it is too small for the idea of the unconditioned for the member at

which we have discontinued our division still admits a regress to many more

parts contained in the object




thirdly suppose that every event in the world happens in accordance with the

laws of nature the causality of a cause must itself be an event and

necessitates a regress to a still higher cause and consequently the unceasing

prolongation of the series of conditions a parte priori operative nature is

therefore too large for every conception we can form in the synthesis of

cosmical events




if we admit the existence of spontaneously produced events that is of free

agency we are driven in our search for sufficient reasons on an unavoidable

law of nature and are compelled to appeal to the empirical law of causality

and we find that any such totality of connection in our synthesis is too small

for our necessary empirical conception




fourthly if we assume the existence of an absolutely necessary

beingwhether it be the world or something in the world or the cause of

the worldwe must place it in a time at an infinite distance from any

given moment for otherwise it must be dependent on some other and higher

existence such an existence is in this case too large for our empirical

conception and unattainable by the continued regress of any synthesis




but if we believe that everything in the worldbe it condition or

conditionedis contingent every given existence is too small for our

conception for in this case we are compelled to seek for some other existence

upon which the former depends




we have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is either too great

or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis and consequently for

every possible conception of the understanding why did we not express

ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of this and instead of accusing the

cosmological idea of over stepping or of falling short of its true aim

possible experience say that in the first case the empirical conception is

always too small for the idea and in the second too great and thus attach the

blame of these contradictions to the empirical regress the reason is this

possible experience can alone give reality to our conceptions without it a

conception is merely an idea without truth or relation to an object hence a

possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we are to judge

whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction of thought or

whether it relates to an object in the world if we say of a thing that in

relation to some other thing it is too large or too small the former is

considered as existing for the sake of the latter and requiring to be adapted

to it among the trivial subjects of discussion in the old schools of

dialectics was this question if a ball cannot pass through a hole

shall we say that the ball is too large or the hole too small in this

case it is indifferent what expression we employ for we do not know which

exists for the sake of the other on the other hand we cannot say the

man is too long for his coat but the coat is too short for the

man




we are thus led to the wellfounded suspicion that the cosmological ideas and

all the conflicting sophistical assertions connected with them are based upon

a false and fictitious conception of the mode in which the object of these

ideas is presented to us and this suspicion will probably direct us how to

expose the illusion that has so long led us astray from the truth


section vi transcendental idealism as the key to

the solution of pure cosmological dialectic


in the transcendental sthetic we proved that everything intuited in space and

time all objects of a possible experience are nothing but phenomena that is

mere representations and that these as presented to usas extended

bodies or as series of changeshave no selfsubsistent existence apart

from human thought this doctrine i call transcendental idealism59 the realist in the transcendental sense

regards these modifications of our sensibility these mere representations as

things subsisting in themselves



 59

i have elsewhere termed this theory formal idealism to distinguish it from

material idealism which doubts or denies the existence of external things to

avoid ambiguity it seems advisable in many cases to employ this term instead

of that mentioned in the text




it would be unjust to accuse us of holding the longdecried theory of empirical

idealism which while admitting the reality of space denies or at least

doubts the existence of bodies extended in it and thus leaves us without a

sufficient criterion of reality and illusion the supporters of this theory

find no difficulty in admitting the reality of the phenomena of the internal

sense in time nay they go the length of maintaining that this internal

experience is of itself a sufficient proof of the real existence of its object

as a thing in itself




transcendental idealism allows that the objects of external intuitionas

intuited in space and all changes in timeas represented by the internal

sense are real for as space is the form of that intuition which we call

external and without objects in space no empirical representation could be

given us we can and ought to regard extended bodies in it as real the case is

the same with representations in time but time and space with all phenomena

therein are not in themselves things they are nothing but representations and

cannot exist out of and apart from the mind nay the sensuous internal

intuition of the mind as the object of consciousness the determination of

which is represented by the succession of different states in time is not the

real proper self as it exists in itselfnot the transcendental

subjectbut only a phenomenon which is presented to the sensibility of

this to us unknown being this internal phenomenon cannot be admitted to be a

selfsubsisting thing for its condition is time and time cannot be the

condition of a thing in itself but the empirical truth of phenomena in space

and time is guaranteed beyond the possibility of doubt and sufficiently

distinguished from the illusion of dreams or fancyalthough both have a

proper and thorough connection in an experience according to empirical laws

the objects of experience then are not things in themselves but are given only

in experience and have no existence apart from and independently of

experience that there may be inhabitants in the moon although no one has ever

observed them must certainly be admitted but this assertion means only that

we may in the possible progress of experience discover them at some future

time for that which stands in connection with a perception according to the

laws of the progress of experience is real they are therefore really existent

if they stand in empirical connection with my actual or real consciousness

although they are not in themselves real that is apart from the progress of

experience




there is nothing actually givenwe can be conscious of nothing as real

except a perception and the empirical progression from it to other possible

perceptions for phenomena as mere representations are real only in

perception and perception is in fact nothing but the reality of an empirical

representation that is a phenomenon to call a phenomenon a real thing prior

to perception means either that we must meet with this phenomenon in the

progress of experience or it means nothing at all for i can say only of a

thing in itself that it exists without relation to the senses and experience

but we are speaking here merely of phenomena in space and time both of which

are determinations of sensibility and not of things in themselves it follows

that phenomena are not things in themselves but are mere representations

which if not given in usin perceptionare nonexistent




the faculty of sensuous intuition is properly a receptivitya capacity of

being affected in a certain manner by representations the relation of which to

each other is a pure intuition of space and timethe pure forms of

sensibility these representations in so far as they are connected and

determinable in this relation in space and time according to laws of the

unity of experience are called objects the nonsensuous cause of these

representations is completely unknown to us and hence cannot be intuited as an

object for such an object could not be represented either in space or in time

and without these conditions intuition or representation is impossible we may

at the same time term the nonsensuous cause of phenomena the transcendental

objectbut merely as a mental correlate to sensibility considered as a

receptivity to this transcendental object we may attribute the whole

connection and extent of our possible perceptions and say that it is given and

exists in itself prior to all experience but the phenomena corresponding to

it are not given as things in themselves but in experience alone for they

are mere representations receiving from perceptions alone significance and

relation to a real object under the condition that this or that

perceptionindicating an objectis in complete connection with all

others in accordance with the rules of the unity of experience thus we can

say the things that really existed in past time are given in the

transcendental object of experience but these are to me real objects

only in so far as i can represent to my own mind that a regressive series of

possible perceptionsfollowing the indications of history or the

footsteps of cause and effectin accordance with empirical

lawsthat in one word the course of the world conducts us to an elapsed

series of time as the condition of the present time this series in past time

is represented as real not in itself but only in connection with a possible

experience thus when i say that certain events occurred in past time i

merely assert the possibility of prolonging the chain of experience from the

present perception upwards to the conditions that determine it according to

time




if i represent to myself all objects existing in all space and time i do not

thereby place these in space and time prior to all experience on the contrary

such a representation is nothing more than the notion of a possible experience

in its absolute completeness in experience alone are those objects which are

nothing but representations given but when i say they existed prior to my

experience this means only that i must begin with the perception present to me

and follow the track indicated until i discover them in some part or region of

experience the cause of the empirical condition of this progressionand

consequently at what member therein i must stop and at what point in the

regress i am to find this memberis transcendental and hence necessarily

incognizable but with this we have not to do our concern is only with the law

of progression in experience in which objects that is phenomena are given

it is a matter of indifference whether i say i may in the progress of

experience discover stars at a hundred times greater distance than the most

distant of those now visible or stars at this distance may be

met in space although no one has or ever will discover them for if

they are given as things in themselves without any relation to possible

experience they are for me nonexistent consequently are not objects for

they are not contained in the regressive series of experience but if these

phenomena must be employed in the construction or support of the cosmological

idea of an absolute whole and when we are discussing a question that oversteps

the limits of possible experience the proper distinction of the different

theories of the reality of sensuous objects is of great importance in order to

avoid the illusion which must necessarily arise from the misinterpretation of

our empirical conceptions


section vii critical solution of the cosmological

problem


the antinomy of pure reason is based upon the following dialectical argument

if that which is conditioned is given the whole series of its

conditions is also given but sensuous objects are given as conditioned

consequently this syllogism the major of which seems so natural and

evident introduces as many cosmological ideas as there are different kinds of

conditions in the synthesis of phenomena in so far as these conditions

constitute a series these ideas require absolute totality in the series and

thus place reason in inextricable embarrassment before proceeding to expose

the fallacy in this dialectical argument it will be necessary to have a

correct understanding of certain conceptions that appear in it




in the first place the following proposition is evident and indubitably

certain if the conditioned is given a regress in the series of all its

conditions is thereby imperatively required for the very conception of

a conditioned is a conception of something related to a condition and if this

condition is itself conditioned to another conditionand so on through

all the members of the series this proposition is therefore analytical and

has nothing to fear from transcendental criticism it is a logical postulate of

reason to pursue as far as possible the connection of a conception with its

conditions




if in the second place both the conditioned and the condition are things in

themselves and if the former is given not only is the regress to the latter

requisite but the latter is really given with the former now as this is true

of all the members of the series the entire series of conditions and with

them the unconditioned is at the same time given in the very fact of the

conditioned the existence of which is possible only in and through that

series being given in this case the synthesis of the conditioned with its

condition is a synthesis of the understanding merely which represents things

as they are without regarding whether and how we can cognize them but if i

have to do with phenomena which in their character of mere representations

are not given if i do not attain to a cognition of them in other words to

themselves for they are nothing more than empirical cognitions i am not

entitled to say if the conditioned is given all its conditions as

phenomena are also given i cannot therefore from the fact of a

conditioned being given infer the absolute totality of the series of its

conditions for phenomena are nothing but an empirical synthesis in

apprehension or perception and are therefore given only in it now in

speaking of phenomena it does not follow that if the conditioned is given the

synthesis which constitutes its empirical condition is also thereby given and

presupposed such a synthesis can be established only by an actual regress in

the series of conditions but we are entitled to say in this case that a

regress to the conditions of a conditioned in other words that a continuous

empirical synthesis is enjoined that if the conditions are not given they

are at least required and that we are certain to discover the conditions in

this regress




we can now see that the major in the above cosmological syllogism takes the

conditioned in the transcendental signification which it has in the pure

category while the minor speaks of it in the empirical signification which it

has in the category as applied to phenomena there is therefore a dialectical

fallacy in the syllogisma sophisma figurae dictionis but this fallacy

is not a consciously devised one but a perfectly natural illusion of the

common reason of man for when a thing is given as conditioned we presuppose

in the major its conditions and their series unperceived as it were and

unseen because this is nothing more than the logical requirement of complete

and satisfactory premisses for a given conclusion in this case time is

altogether left out in the connection of the conditioned with the condition

they are supposed to be given in themselves and contemporaneously it is

moreover just as natural to regard phenomena in the minor as things in

themselves and as objects presented to the pure understanding as in the major

in which complete abstraction was made of all conditions of intuition but it

is under these conditions alone that objects are given now we overlooked a

remarkable distinction between the conceptions the synthesis of the

conditioned with its condition and the complete series of the latter in the

major are not limited by time and do not contain the conception of

succession on the contrary the empirical synthesis and the series of

conditions in the phenomenal worldsubsumed in the minorare

necessarily successive and given in time alone it follows that i cannot

presuppose in the minor as i did in the major the absolute totality of the

synthesis and of the series therein represented for in the major all the

members of the series are given as things in themselveswithout any

limitations or conditions of time while in the minor they are possible only in

and through a successive regress which cannot exist except it be actually

carried into execution in the world of phenomena




after this proof of the viciousness of the argument commonly employed in

maintaining cosmological assertions both parties may now be justly dismissed

as advancing claims without grounds or title but the process has not been

ended by convincing them that one or both were in the wrong and had maintained

an assertion which was without valid grounds of proof nothing seems to be

clearer than that if one maintains the world has a beginning

and another the world has no beginning one of the two must be

right but it is likewise clear that if the evidence on both sides is equal

it is impossible to discover on what side the truth lies and the controversy

continues although the parties have been recommended to peace before the

tribunal of reason there remains then no other means of settling the

question than to convince the parties who refute each other with such

conclusiveness and ability that they are disputing about nothing and that a

transcendental illusion has been mocking them with visions of reality where

there is none the mode of adjusting a dispute which cannot be decided upon its

own merits we shall now proceed to lay before our readers





zeno of elea a subtle dialectician was severely reprimanded by plato as a

sophist who merely from the base motive of exhibiting his skill in

discussion maintained and subverted the same proposition by arguments as

powerful and convincing on the one side as on the other he maintained for

example that god who was probably nothing more in his view than the world

is neither finite nor infinite neither in motion nor in rest neither similar

nor dissimilar to any other thing it seemed to those philosophers who

criticized his mode of discussion that his purpose was to deny completely both

of two selfcontradictory propositionswhich is absurd but i cannot

believe that there is any justice in this accusation the first of these

propositions i shall presently consider in a more detailed manner with regard

to the others if by the word of god he understood merely the universe his

meaning must have beenthat it cannot be permanently present in one

placethat is at restnor be capable of changing its

placethat is of movingbecause all places are in the universe

and the universe itself is therefore in no place again if the universe

contains in itself everything that exists it cannot be similar or dissimilar

to any other thing because there is in fact no other thing with which it can

be compared if two opposite judgements presuppose a contingent impossible or

arbitrary condition bothin spite of their opposition which is

however not properly or really a contradictionfall away because the

condition which ensured the validity of both has itself disappeared




if we say everybody has either a good or a bad smell we have

omitted a third possible judgementit has no smell at all and thus both

conflicting statements may be false if we say it is either

goodsmelling or not goodsmelling vel suaveolens vel nonsuaveolens

both judgements are contradictorily opposed and the contradictory opposite of

the former judgementsome bodies are not goodsmellingembraces

also those bodies which have no smell at all in the preceding pair of opposed

judgements per disparata the contingent condition of the conception of body

smell attached to both conflicting statements instead of having been omitted

in the latter which is consequently not the contradictory opposite of the

former




if accordingly we say the world is either infinite in extension or

it is not infinite non est infinitus and if the former proposition is

false its contradictory oppositethe world is not infinitemust be

true and thus i should deny the existence of an infinite without however

affirming the existence of a finite world but if we construct our proposition

thus the world is either infinite or finite noninfinite both

statements may be false for in this case we consider the world as per se

determined in regard to quantity and while in the one judgement we deny its

infinite and consequently perhaps its independent existence in the other we

append to the world regarded as a thing in itself a certain

determinationthat of finitude and the latter may be false as well as

the former if the world is not given as a thing in itself and thus neither as

finite nor as infinite in quantity this kind of opposition i may be allowed to

term dialectical that of contradictories may be called analytical opposition

thus then of two dialectically opposed judgements both may be false from the

fact that the one is not a mere contradictory of the other but actually

enounces more than is requisite for a full and complete contradiction




when we regard the two propositionsthe world is infinite in

quantity and the world is finite in quantity as

contradictory opposites we are assuming that the worldthe complete

series of phenomenais a thing in itself for it remains as a permanent

quantity whether i deny the infinite or the finite regress in the series of

its phenomena but if we dismiss this assumptionthis transcendental

illusionand deny that it is a thing in itself the contradictory

opposition is metamorphosed into a merely dialectical one and the world as

not existing in itselfindependently of the regressive series of my

representationsexists in like manner neither as a whole which is

infinite nor as a whole which is finite in itself the universe exists for me

only in the empirical regress of the series of phenomena and not per se if

then it is always conditioned it is never completely or as a whole and it

is therefore not an unconditioned whole and does not exist as such either

with an infinite or with a finite quantity




what we have here said of the first cosmological ideathat of the

absolute totality of quantity in phenomenaapplies also to the others

the series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressive synthesis

itself and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing in itselfgiven

prior to all regress hence i am compelled to say the aggregate of

parts in a given phenomenon is in itself neither finite nor infinite and these

parts are given only in the regressive synthesis of decompositiona

synthesis which is never given in absolute completeness either as finite or

as infinite the same is the case with the series of subordinated

causes or of the conditioned up to the unconditioned and necessary existence

which can never be regarded as in itself and in its totality either as finite

or as infinite because as a series of subordinate representations it

subsists only in the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing

previously to this regress or as a selfsubsistent series of things




thus the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas disappears for the

above demonstration has established the fact that it is merely the product of a

dialectical and illusory opposition which arises from the application of the

idea of absolute totalityadmissible only as a condition of things in

themselvesto phenomena which exist only in our representations

andwhen constituting a seriesin a successive regress this

antinomy of reason may however be really profitable to our speculative

interests not in the way of contributing any dogmatical addition but as

presenting to us another material support in our critical investigations for

it furnishes us with an indirect proof of the transcendental ideality of

phenomena if our minds were not completely satisfied with the direct proof set

forth in the trancendental sthetic the proof would proceed in the following

dilemma if the world is a whole existing in itself it must be either finite

or infinite but it is neither finite nor infiniteas has been shown on

the one side by the thesis on the other by the antithesis therefore the

worldthe content of all phenomenais not a whole existing in

itself it follows that phenomena are nothing apart from our representations

and this is what we mean by transcendental ideality




this remark is of some importance it enables us to see that the proofs of the

fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistriesare not fallacious but

grounded on the nature of reason and validunder the supposition that

phenomena are things in themselves the opposition of the judgements which

follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the initial supposition and thus

helps us to discover the true constitution of objects of sense this

transcendental dialectic does not favour scepticism although it presents us

with a triumphant demonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method the

great utility of which is apparent in the antinomy where the arguments of

reason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force and although

the result of these conflicts of reason is not what we expectedalthough

we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition to metaphysical

sciencewe have still reaped a great advantage in the correction of our

judgements on these subjects of thought


section viii regulative principle of pure reason in

relation to the cosmological ideas


the cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certain knowledge

in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in the world of sense

considered as a thing in itself the actual regress in the series is the only

means of approaching this maximum this principle of pure reason therefore

may still be considered as validnot as an axiom enabling us to cogitate

totality in the object as actual but as a problem for the understanding which

requires it to institute and to continue in conformity with the idea of

totality in the mind the regress in the series of the conditions of a given

conditioned for in the world of sense that is in space and time every

condition which we discover in our investigation of phenomena is itself

conditioned because sensuous objects are not things in themselves in which

case an absolutely unconditioned might be reached in the progress of

cognition but are merely empirical representations the conditions of which

must always be found in intuition the principle of reason is therefore

properly a mere ruleprescribing a regress in the series of conditions

for given phenomena and prohibiting any pause or rest on an absolutely

unconditioned it is therefore not a principle of the possibility of

experience or of the empirical cognition of sensuous objectsconsequently

not a principle of the understanding for every experience is confined within

certain proper limits determined by the given intuition still less is it a

constitutive principle of reason authorizing us to extend our conception of the

sensuous world beyond all possible experience it is merely a principle for the

enlargement and extension of experience as far as is possible for human

faculties it forbids us to consider any empirical limits as absolute it is

hence a principle of reason which as a rule dictates how we ought to

proceed in our empirical regress but is unable to anticipate or indicate prior

to the empirical regress what is given in the object itself i have termed it

for this reason a regulative principle of reason while the principle of the

absolute totality of the series of conditions as existing in itself and given

in the object is a constitutive cosmological principle this distinction will

at once demonstrate the falsehood of the constitutive principle and prevent us

from attributing by a transcendental subreptio objective reality to an idea

which is valid only as a rule




in order to understand the proper meaning of this rule of pure reason we must

notice first that it cannot tell us what the object is but only how the

empirical regress is to be proceeded with in order to attain to the complete

conception of the object if it gave us any information in respect to the

former statement it would be a constitutive principlea principle

impossible from the nature of pure reason it will not therefore enable us to

establish any such conclusions as the series of conditions for a given

conditioned is in itself finite or it is infinite for

in this case we should be cogitating in the mere idea of absolute totality an

object which is not and cannot be given in experience inasmuch as we should be

attributing a reality objective and independent of the empirical synthesis to

a series of phenomena this idea of reason cannot then be regarded as

validexcept as a rule for the regressive synthesis in the series of

conditions according to which we must proceed from the conditioned through

all intermediate and subordinate conditions up to the unconditioned although

this goal is unattained and unattainable for the absolutely unconditioned

cannot be discovered in the sphere of experience




we now proceed to determine clearly our notion of a synthesis which can never

be complete there are two terms commonly employed for this purpose these

terms are regarded as expressions of different and distinguishable notions

although the ground of the distinction has never been clearly exposed the term

employed by the mathematicians is progressus in infinitum the philosophers

prefer the expression progressus in indefinitum without detaining the reader

with an examination of the reasons for such a distinction or with remarks on

the right or wrong use of the terms i shall endeavour clearly to determine

these conceptions so far as is necessary for the purpose in this critique




we may with propriety say of a straight line that it may be produced to

infinity in this case the distinction between a progressus in infinitum and a

progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety for although when we

say produce a straight line it is more correct to say in

indefinitum than in infinitum because the former means produce it as

far as you please the second you must not cease to produce

it the expression in infinitum is when we are speaking of the power to

do it perfectly correct for we can always make it longer if we

pleaseon to infinity and this remark holds good in all cases when we

speak of a progressus that is an advancement from the condition to the

conditioned this possible advancement always proceeds to infinity we may

proceed from a given pair in the descending line of generation from father to

son and cogitate a neverending line of descendants from it for in such a

case reason does not demand absolute totality in the series because it does

not presuppose it as a condition and as given datum but merely as

conditioned and as capable of being given dabile




very different is the case with the problem how far the regress which

ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions must extend

whether i can say it is a regress in infinitum or only

in indefinitum and whether for example setting out from the

human beings at present alive in the world i may ascend in the series of their

ancestors in infinitumor whether all that can be said is that so far

as i have proceeded i have discovered no empirical ground for considering the

series limited so that i am justified and indeed compelled to search for

ancestors still further back although i am not obliged by the idea of reason

to presuppose them




my answer to this question is if the series is given in empirical

intuition as a whole the regress in the series of its internal conditions

proceeds in infinitum but if only one member of the series is given from

which the regress is to proceed to absolute totality the regress is possible

only in indefinitum for example the division of a portion of matter

given within certain limitsof a body that isproceeds in

infinitum for as the condition of this whole is its part and the condition

of the part a part of the part and so on and as in this regress of

decomposition an unconditioned indivisible member of the series of conditions

is not to be found there are no reasons or grounds in experience for stopping

in the division but on the contrary the more remote members of the division

are actually and empirically given prior to this division that is to say the

division proceeds to infinity on the other hand the series of ancestors of

any given human being is not given in its absolute totality in any

experience and yet the regress proceeds from every genealogical member of this

series to one still higher and does not meet with any empirical limit

presenting an absolutely unconditioned member of the series but as the members

of such a series are not contained in the empirical intuition of the whole

prior to the regress this regress does not proceed to infinity but only in

indefinitum that is we are called upon to discover other and higher members

which are themselves always conditioned




in neither casethe regressus in infinitum nor the regressus in

indefinitum is the series of conditions to be considered as actually infinite

in the object itself this might be true of things in themselves but it cannot

be asserted of phenomena which as conditions of each other are only given in

the empirical regress itself hence the question no longer is what is

the quantity of this series of conditions in itselfis it finite or

infinite for it is nothing in itself but how is the empirical

regress to be commenced and how far ought we to proceed with it and

here a signal distinction in the application of this rule becomes apparent if

the whole is given empirically it is possible to recede in the series of its

internal conditions to infinity but if the whole is not given and can only be

given by and through the empirical regress i can only say it is

possible to infinity to proceed to still higher conditions in the

series in the first case i am justified in asserting that more members

are empirically given in the object than i attain to in the regress of

decomposition in the second case i am justified only in saying that i can

always proceed further in the regress because no member of the series is given

as absolutely conditioned and thus a higher member is possible and an inquiry

with regard to it is necessary in the one case it is necessary to find other

members of the series in the other it is necessary to inquire for others

inasmuch as experience presents no absolute limitation of the regress for

either you do not possess a perception which absolutely limits your empirical

regress and in this case the regress cannot be regarded as complete or you

do possess such a limitative perception in which case it is not a part of your

series for that which limits must be distinct from that which is limited by

it and it is incumbent you to continue your regress up to this condition and

so on




these remarks will be placed in their proper light by their application in the

following section


section ix of the empirical use of the regulative

principle of reason with regard to the cosmological ideas


we have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of the conceptions

of reason or of understanding we have shown likewise that the demand of

absolute totality in the series of conditions in the world of sense arises from

a transcendental employment of reason resting on the opinion that phenomena

are to be regarded as things in themselves it follows that we are not required

to answer the question respecting the absolute quantity of a

serieswhether it is in itself limited or unlimited we are only called

upon to determine how far we must proceed in the empirical regress from

condition to condition in order to discover in conformity with the rule of

reason a full and correct answer to the questions proposed by reason itself




this principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for the extension of a

possible experienceits invalidity as a principle constitutive of

phenomena in themselves having been sufficiently demonstrated and thus too

the antinomial conflict of reason with itself is completely put an end to

inasmuch as we have not only presented a critical solution of the fallacy

lurking in the opposite statements of reason but have shown the true meaning

of the ideas which gave rise to these statements the dialectical principle of

reason has therefore been changed into a doctrinal principle but in fact if

this principle in the subjective signification which we have shown to be its

only true sense may be guaranteed as a principle of the unceasing extension of

the employment of our understanding its influence and value are just as great

as if it were an axiom for the  priori determination of objects for such an

axiom could not exert a stronger influence on the extension and rectification

of our knowledge otherwise than by procuring for the principles of the

understanding the most widely expanded employment in the field of experience


i solution of the cosmological idea of the totality

of the composition of phenomena in the universe


here as well as in the case of the other cosmological problems the ground of

the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that in our empirical

regress no experience of an absolute limit and consequently no experience of a

condition which is itself absolutely unconditioned is discoverable and the

truth of this proposition itself rests upon the consideration that such an

experience must represent to us phenomena as limited by nothing or the mere

void on which our continued regress by means of perception must

abutwhich is impossible




now this proposition which declares that every condition attained in the

empirical regress must itself be considered empirically conditioned contains

the rule in terminis which requires me to whatever extent i may have

proceeded in the ascending series always to look for some higher member in the

serieswhether this member is to become known to me through experience

or not




nothing further is necessary then for the solution of the first cosmological

problem than to decide whether in the regress to the unconditioned quantity

of the universe as regards space and time this never limited ascent ought to

be called a regressus in infinitum or indefinitum




the general representation which we form in our minds of the series of all past

states or conditions of the world or of all the things which at present exist

in it is itself nothing more than a possible empirical regress which is

cogitatedalthough in an undetermined mannerin the mind and which

gives rise to the conception of a series of conditions for a given object60 now i have a conception of the

universe but not an intuitionthat is not an intuition of it as a

whole thus i cannot infer the magnitude of the regress from the quantity or

magnitude of the world and determine the former by means of the latter on the

contrary i must first of all form a conception of the quantity or magnitude of

the world from the magnitude of the empirical regress but of this regress i

know nothing more than that i ought to proceed from every given member of the

series of conditions to one still higher but the quantity of the universe is

not thereby determined and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds in

infinitum such an affirmation would anticipate the members of the series which

have not yet been reached and represent the number of them as beyond the grasp

of any empirical synthesis it would consequently determine the cosmical

quantity prior to the regress although only in a negative mannerwhich

is impossible for the world is not given in its totality in any intuition

consequently its quantity cannot be given prior to the regress it follows

that we are unable to make any declaration respecting the cosmical quantity in

itselfnot even that the regress in it is a regress in infinitum we must

only endeavour to attain to a conception of the quantity of the universe in

conformity with the rule which determines the empirical regress in it but this

rule merely requires us never to admit an absolute limit to our

serieshow far soever we may have proceeded in it but always on the

contrary to subordinate every phenomenon to some other as its condition and

consequently to proceed to this higher phenomenon such a regress is

therefore the regressus in indefinitum which as not determining a quantity

in the object is clearly distinguishable from the regressus in infinitum



 60

the cosmical series can neither be greater nor smaller than the possible

empirical regress upon which its conception is based and as this regress

cannot be a determinate infinite regress still less a determinate finite

absolutely limited it is evident that we cannot regard the world as either

finite or infinite because the regress which gives us the representation of

the world is neither finite nor infinite




it follows from what we have said that we are not justified in declaring the

world to be infinite in space or as regards past time for this conception of

an infinite given quantity is empirical but we cannot apply the conception of

an infinite quantity to the world as an object of the senses i cannot say

the regress from a given perception to everything limited either in

space or time proceeds in infinitum for this presupposes an infinite

cosmical quantity neither can i say it is finite for an

absolute limit is likewise impossible in experience it follows that i am not

entitled to make any assertion at all respecting the whole object of

experiencethe world of sense i must limit my declarations to the rule

according to which experience or empirical knowledge is to be attained




to the question therefore respecting the cosmical quantity the first and

negative answer is the world has no beginning in time and no absolute

limit in space




for in the contrary case it would be limited by a void time on the one hand

and by a void space on the other now since the world as a phenomenon cannot

be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a thing in itself it must be

possible for us to have a perception of this limitation by a void time and a

void space but such a perceptionsuch an experience is impossible

because it has no content consequently an absolute cosmical limit is

empirically and therefore absolutely impossible61


 61

the reader will remark that the proof presented above is very different from

the dogmatical demonstration given in the antithesis of the first antinomy in

that demonstration it was taken for granted that the world is a thing in

itselfgiven in its totality prior to all regress and a determined

position in space and time was denied to itif it was not considered as

occupying all time and all space hence our conclusion differed from that given

above for we inferred in the antithesis the actual infinity of the world




from this follows the affirmative answer the regress in the series of

phenomenaas a determination of the cosmical quantity proceeds in

indefinitum this is equivalent to saying the world of sense has

no absolute quantity but the empirical regress through which alone the world

of sense is presented to us on the side of its conditions rests upon a rule

which requires it to proceed from every member of the series as conditioned

to one still more remote whether through personal experience or by means of

history or the chain of cause and effect and not to cease at any point in

this extension of the possible empirical employment of the

understanding and this is the proper and only use which reason can make

of its principles




the above rule does not prescribe an unceasing regress in one kind of

phenomena it does not for example forbid us in our ascent from an

individual human being through the line of his ancestors to expect that we

shall discover at some point of the regress a primeval pair or to admit in

the series of heavenly bodies a sun at the farthest possible distance from

some centre all that it demands is a perpetual progress from phenomena to

phenomena even although an actual perception is not presented by them as in

the case of our perceptions being so weak as that we are unable to become

conscious of them since they nevertheless belong to possible experience




every beginning is in time and all limits to extension are in space but space

and time are in the world of sense consequently phenomena in the world are

conditionally limited but the world itself is not limited either

conditionally or unconditionally




for this reason and because neither the world nor the cosmical series of

conditions to a given conditioned can be completely given our conception of

the cosmical quantity is given only in and through the regress and not prior to

itin a collective intuition but the regress itself is really nothing

more than the determining of the cosmical quantity and cannot therefore give

us any determined conception of itstill less a conception of a quantity

which is in relation to a certain standard infinite the regress does not

therefore proceed to infinity an infinity given but only to an indefinite

extent for or the of presenting to us a quantityrealized only in and

through the regress itself


ii solution of the cosmological idea of the totality

of the division of a whole given in intuition


when i divide a whole which is given in intuition i proceed from a conditioned

to its conditions the division of the parts of the whole subdivisio or

decompositio is a regress in the series of these conditions the absolute

totality of this series would be actually attained and given to the mind if

the regress could arrive at simple parts but if all the parts in a continuous

decomposition are themselves divisible the division that is to say the

regress proceeds from the conditioned to its conditions in infinitum because

the conditions the parts are themselves contained in the conditioned and as

the latter is given in a limited intuition the former are all given along with

it this regress cannot therefore be called a regressus in indefinitum as

happened in the case of the preceding cosmological idea the regress in which

proceeded from the conditioned to the conditions not given contemporaneously

and along with it but discoverable only through the empirical regress we are

not however entitled to affirm of a whole of this kind which is divisible in

infinitum that it consists of an infinite number of parts for although all

the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole the whole division is

not contained therein the division is contained only in the progressing

decompositionin the regress itself which is the condition of the

possibility and actuality of the series now as this regress is infinite all

the members parts to which it attains must be contained in the given whole as

an aggregate but the complete series of division is not contained therein for

this series being infinite in succession and always incomplete cannot

represent an infinite number of members and still less a composition of these

members into a whole




to apply this remark to space every limited part of space presented to

intuition is a whole the parts of which are always spacesto whatever

extent subdivided every limited space is hence divisible to infinity




let us again apply the remark to an external phenomenon enclosed in limits

that is a body the divisibility of a body rests upon the divisibility of

space which is the condition of the possibility of the body as an extended

whole a body is consequently divisible to infinity though it does not for

that reason consist of an infinite number of parts




it certainly seems that as a body must be cogitated as substance in space the

law of divisibility would not be applicable to it as substance for we may and

ought to grant in the case of space that division or decomposition to any

extent never can utterly annihilate composition that is to say the smallest

part of space must still consist of spaces otherwise space would entirely

cease to existwhich is impossible but the assertion on the other hand

that when all composition in matter is annihilated in thought nothing remains

does not seem to harmonize with the conception of substance which must be

properly the subject of all composition and must remain even after the

conjunction of its attributes in spacewhich constituted a bodyis

annihilated in thought but this is not the case with substance in the

phenomenal world which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the pure

category phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject it is merely a

permanent sensuous image and nothing more than an intuition in which the

unconditioned is not to be found




but although this rule of progress to infinity is legitimate and applicable to

the subdivision of a phenomenon as a mere occupation or filling of space it

is not applicable to a whole consisting of a number of distinct parts and

constituting a quantum discretumthat is to say an organized body it

cannot be admitted that every part in an organized whole is itself organized

and that in analysing it to infinity we must always meet with organized

parts although we may allow that the parts of the matter which we decompose in

infinitum may be organized for the infinity of the division of a phenomenon

in space rests altogether on the fact that the divisibility of a phenomenon is

given only in and through this infinity that is an undetermined number of

parts is given while the parts themselves are given and determined only in and

through the subdivision in a word the infinity of the division necessarily

presupposes that the whole is not already divided in se hence our division

determines a number of parts in the wholea number which extends just as

far as the actual regress in the division while on the other hand the very

notion of a body organized to infinity represents the whole as already and in

itself divided we expect therefore to find in it a determinate but at the

same time infinite number of partswhich is selfcontradictory for we

should thus have a whole containing a series of members which could not be

completed in any regresswhich is infinite and at the same time complete

in an organized composite infinite divisibility is applicable only to a

quantum continuum and is based entirely on the infinite divisibility of space

but in a quantum discretum the multitude of parts or units is always

determined and hence always equal to some number to what extent a body may be

organized experience alone can inform us and although so far as our

experience of this or that body has extended we may not have discovered any

inorganic part such parts must exist in possible experience but how far the

transcendental division of a phenomenon must extend we cannot know from

experienceit is a question which experience cannot answer it is

answered only by the principle of reason which forbids us to consider the

empirical regress in the analysis of extended body as ever absolutely

complete




concluding remark on the solution of the transcendental mathematical

ideasand introductory to the solution of the dynamical ideas




we presented the antinomy of pure reason in a tabular form and we endeavoured

to show the ground of this selfcontradiction on the part of reason and the

only means of bringing it to a conclusionnamely by declaring both

contradictory statements to be false we represented in these antinomies the

conditions of phenomena as belonging to the conditioned according to relations

of space and timewhich is the usual supposition of the common

understanding in this respect all dialectical representations of totality in

the series of conditions to a given conditioned were perfectly homogeneous

the condition was always a member of the series along with the conditioned and

thus the homogeneity of the whole series was assured in this case the regress

could never be cogitated as complete or if this was the case a member really

conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member consequently as

unconditioned in such an antinomy therefore we did not consider the object

that is the conditioned but the series of conditions belonging to the object

and the magnitude of that series and thus arose the difficultya

difficulty not to be settled by any decision regarding the claims of the two

parties but simply by cutting the knotby declaring the series proposed

by reason to be either too long or too short for the understanding which could

in neither case make its conceptions adequate with the ideas




but we have overlooked up to this point an essential difference existing

between the conceptions of the understanding which reason endeavours to raise

to the rank of ideastwo of these indicating a mathematical and two a

dynamical synthesis of phenomena hitherto it was necessary to signalize this

distinction for just as in our general representation of all transcendental

ideas we considered them under phenomenal conditions so in the two

mathematical ideas our discussion is concerned solely with an object in the

world of phenomena but as we are now about to proceed to the consideration of

the dynamical conceptions of the understanding and their adequateness with

ideas we must not lose sight of this distinction we shall find that it opens

up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in which reason is involved for

while in the first two antinomies both parties were dismissed on the ground

of having advanced statements based upon false hypothesis in the present case

the hope appears of discovering a hypothesis which may be consistent with the

demands of reason and the judge completing the statement of the grounds of

claim which both parties had left in an unsatisfactory state the question may

be settled on its own merits not by dismissing the claimants but by a

comparison of the arguments on both sides if we consider merely their

extension and whether they are adequate with ideas the series of conditions

may be regarded as all homogeneous but the conception of the understanding

which lies at the basis of these ideas contains either a synthesis of the

homogeneous presupposed in every quantityin its composition as well as

in its division or of the heterogeneous which is the case in the dynamical

synthesis of cause and effect as well as of the necessary and the contingent




thus it happens that in the mathematical series of phenomena no other than a

sensuous condition is admissiblea condition which is itself a member of

the series while the dynamical series of sensuous conditions admits a

heterogeneous condition which is not a member of the series but as purely

intelligible lies out of and beyond it and thus reason is satisfied and an

unconditioned placed at the head of the series of phenomena without

introducing confusion into or discontinuing it contrary to the principles of

the understanding




now from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition of phenomena

which does not form a part of the series of phenomena arises a result which we

should not have expected from an antinomy in former cases the result was that

both contradictory dialectical statements were declared to be false in the

present case we find the conditioned in the dynamical series connected with an

empirically unconditioned but nonsensuous condition and thus satisfaction is

done to the understanding on the one hand and to the reason on the other62 while moreover the dialectical

arguments for unconditioned totality in mere phenomena fall to the ground both

propositions of reason may be shown to be true in their proper signification

this could not happen in the case of the cosmological ideas which demanded a

mathematically unconditioned unity for no condition could be placed at the

head of the series of phenomena except one which was itself a phenomenon and

consequently a member of the series



 62

for the understanding cannot admit among phenomena a condition which is itself

empirically unconditioned but if it is possible to cogitate an intelligible

conditionone which is not a member of the series of phenomenafor

a conditioned phenomenon without breaking the series of empirical conditions

such a condition may be admissible as empirically unconditioned and the

empirical regress continue regular unceasing and intact


iii solution of the cosmological idea of the totality

of the deduction of cosmical events from their causes


there are only two modes of causality cogitablethe causality of nature

or of freedom the first is the conjunction of a particular state with another

preceding it in the world of sense the former following the latter by virtue

of a law now as the causality of phenomena is subject to conditions of time

and the preceding state if it had always existed could not have produced an

effect which would make its first appearance at a particular time the

causality of a cause must itself be an effectmust itself have begun to

be and therefore according to the principle of the understanding itself

requires a cause




we must understand on the contrary by the term freedom in the cosmological

sense a faculty of the spontaneous origination of a state the causality of

which therefore is not subordinated to another cause determining it in time

freedom is in this sense a pure transcendental idea which in the first place

contains no empirical element the object of which in the second place cannot

be given or determined in any experience because it is a universal law of the

very possibility of experience that everything which happens must have a

cause that consequently the causality of a cause being itself something that

has happened must also have a cause in this view of the case the whole field

of experience how far soever it may extend contains nothing that is not

subject to the laws of nature but as we cannot by this means attain to an

absolute totality of conditions in reference to the series of causes and

effects reason creates the idea of a spontaneity which can begin to act of

itself and without any external cause determining it to action according to

the natural law of causality




it is especially remarkable that the practical conception of freedom is based

upon the transcendental idea and that the question of the possibility of the

former is difficult only as it involves the consideration of the truth of the

latter freedom in the practical sense is the independence of the will of

coercion by sensuous impulses a will is sensuous in so far as it is

pathologically affected by sensuous impulses it is termed animal arbitrium

brutum when it is pathologically necessitated the human will is certainly an

arbitrium sensitivum not brutum but liberum because sensuousness does not

necessitate its action a faculty existing in man of selfdetermination

independently of all sensuous coercion




it is plain that if all causality in the world of sense were naturaland

natural onlyevery event would be determined by another according to

necessary laws and that consequently phenomena in so far as they determine

the will must necessitate every action as a natural effect from themselves

and thus all practical freedom would fall to the ground with the transcendental

idea for the latter presupposes that although a certain thing has not

happened it ought to have happened and that consequently its phenomenal

cause was not so powerful and determinative as to exclude the causality of our

willa causality capable of producing effects independently of and even

in opposition to the power of natural causes and capable consequently of

spontaneously originating a series of events




here too we find it to be the case as we generally found in the

selfcontradictions and perplexities of a reason which strives to pass the

bounds of possible experience that the problem is properly not physiological

but transcendental the question of the possibility of freedom does indeed

concern psychology but as it rests upon dialectical arguments of pure reason

its solution must engage the attention of transcendental philosophy before

attempting this solution a task which transcendental philosophy cannot

decline it will be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in

the settlement of the question




if phenomena were things in themselves and time and space forms of the

existence of things condition and conditioned would always be members of the

same series and thus would arise in the present case the antinomy common to

all transcendental ideasthat their series is either too great or too

small for the understanding the dynamical ideas which we are about to discuss

in this and the following section possess the peculiarity of relating to an

object not considered as a quantity but as an existence and thus in the

discussion of the present question we may make abstraction of the quantity of

the series of conditions and consider merely the dynamical relation of the

condition to the conditioned the question then suggests itself whether

freedom is possible and if it is whether it can consist with the

universality of the natural law of causality and consequently whether we

enounce a proper disjunctive proposition when we say every effect must

have its origin either in nature or in freedom or whether both cannot

exist together in the same event in different relations the principle of an

unbroken connection between all events in the phenomenal world in accordance

with the unchangeable laws of nature is a wellestablished principle of

transcendental analytic which admits of no exception the question therefore

is whether an effect determined according to the laws of nature can

at the same time be produced by a free agent or whether freedom and nature

mutually exclude each other and here the common but fallacious

hypothesis of the absolute reality of phenomena manifests its injurious

influence in embarrassing the procedure of reason for if phenomena are things

in themselves freedom is impossible in this case nature is the complete and

allsufficient cause of every event and condition and conditioned cause and

effect are contained in the same series and necessitated by the same law if

on the contrary phenomena are held to be as they are in fact nothing more

than mere representations connected with each other in accordance with

empirical laws they must have a ground which is not phenomenal but the

causality of such an intelligible cause is not determined or determinable by

phenomena although its effects as phenomena must be determined by other

phenomenal existences this cause and its causality exist therefore out of and

apart from the series of phenomena while its effects do exist and are

discoverable in the series of empirical conditions such an effect may

therefore be considered to be free in relation to its intelligible cause and

necessary in relation to the phenomena from which it is a necessary

consequencea distinction which stated in this perfectly general and

abstract manner must appear in the highest degree subtle and obscure the

sequel will explain it is sufficient at present to remark that as the

complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is an unalterable law of nature

freedom is impossibleon the supposition that phenomena are absolutely

real hence those philosophers who adhere to the common opinion on this subject

can never succeed in reconciling the ideas of nature and freedom



possibility of freedom in harmony with the universal law of natural

necessity



that element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous i may be

allowed to term intelligible if accordingly an object which must be regarded

as a sensuous phenomenon possesses a faculty which is not an object of sensuous

intuition but by means of which it is capable of being the cause of phenomena

the causality of an object or existence of this kind may be regarded from two

different points of view it may be considered to be intelligible as regards

its actionthe action of a thing which is a thing in itself and

sensuous as regards its effectsthe effects of a phenomenon belonging to

the sensuous world we should accordingly have to form both an empirical and

an intellectual conception of the causality of such a faculty or

powerboth however having reference to the same effect this twofold

manner of cogitating a power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter

to any of the conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or

of a possible experience phenomenanot being things in

themselvesmust have a transcendental object as a foundation which

determines them as mere representations and there seems to be no reason why we

should not ascribe to this transcendental object in addition to the property

of selfphenomenization a causality whose effects are to be met with in the

world of phenomena although it is not itself a phenomenon but every effective

cause must possess a character that is to say a law of its causality without

which it would cease to be a cause in the above case then every sensuous

object would possess an empirical character which guaranteed that its actions

as phenomena stand in complete and harmonious connection conformably to

unvarying natural laws with all other phenomena and can be deduced from

these as conditions and that they do thus in connection with these

constitute a series in the order of nature this sensuous object must in the

second place possess an intelligible character which guarantees it to be the

cause of those actions as phenomena although it is not itself a phenomenon

nor subordinate to the conditions of the world of sense the former may be

termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon the latter the character of

the thing as a thing in itself




now this active subject would in its character of intelligible subject be

subordinate to no conditions of time for time is only a condition of

phenomena and not of things in themselves no action would begin or cease to

be in this subject it would consequently be free from the law of all

determination of timethe law of change namely that everything which

happens must have a cause in the phenomena of a preceding state in one word

the causality of the subject in so far as it is intelligible would not form

part of the series of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an

event in the world of sense again this intelligible character of a thing

cannot be immediately cognized because we can perceive nothing but phenomena

but it must be capable of being cogitated in harmony with the empirical

character for we always find ourselves compelled to place in thought a

transcendental object at the basis of phenomena although we can never know what

this object is in itself




in virtue of its empirical character this subject would at the same time be

subordinate to all the empirical laws of causality and as a phenomenon and

member of the sensuous world its effects would have to be accounted for by a

reference to preceding phenomena eternal phenomena must be capable of

influencing it and its actions in accordance with natural laws must explain

to us how its empirical character that is the law of its causality is to be

cognized in and by means of experience in a word all requisites for a

complete and necessary determination of these actions must be presented to us

by experience




in virtue of its intelligible character on the other hand although we possess

only a general conception of this character the subject must be regarded as

free from all sensuous influences and from all phenomenal determination

moreover as nothing happens in this subjectfor it is a noumenon and

there does not consequently exist in it any change demanding the dynamical

determination of time and for the same reason no connection with phenomena as

causesthis active existence must in its actions be free from and

independent of natural necessity for this necessity exists only in the world

of phenomena it would be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its

effects in the world of sense from itself although the action productive of

these effects does not begin in itself we should not be in this case affirming

that these sensuous effects began to exist of themselves because they are

always determined by prior empirical conditionsby virtue of the

empirical character which is the phenomenon of the intelligible

characterand are possible only as constituting a continuation of the

series of natural causes and thus nature and freedom each in the complete and

absolute signification of these terms can exist without contradiction or

disagreement in the same action



exposition of the cosmological idea of freedom in harmony with the universal

law of natural necessity



i have thought it advisable to lay before the reader at first merely a sketch

of the solution of this transcendental problem in order to enable him to form

with greater ease a clear conception of the course which reason must adopt in

the solution i shall now proceed to exhibit the several momenta of this

solution and to consider them in their order




the natural law that everything which happens must have a cause that the

causality of this cause that is the action of the cause which cannot always

have existed but must be itself an event for it precedes in time some effect

which it has originated must have itself a phenomenal cause by which it is

determined and and consequently all events are empirically determined in an

order of naturethis law i say which lies at the foundation of the

possibility of experience and of a connected system of phenomena or nature is

a law of the understanding from which no departure and to which no exception

can be admitted for to except even a single phenomenon from its operation is

to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus to admit it to be

a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain




thus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes in

which however absolute totality cannot be found but we need not detain

ourselves with this question for it has already been sufficiently answered in

our discussion of the antinomies into which reason falls when it attempts to

reach the unconditioned in the series of phenomena if we permit ourselves to

be deceived by the illusion of transcendental idealism we shall find that

neither nature nor freedom exists now the question is whether

admitting the existence of natural necessity in the world of phenomena it is

possible to consider an effect as at the same time an effect of nature and an

effect of freedomor whether these two modes of causality are

contradictory and incompatible




no phenomenal cause can absolutely and of itself begin a series every action

in so far as it is productive of an event is itself an event or occurrence

and presupposes another preceding state in which its cause existed thus

everything that happens is but a continuation of a series and an absolute

beginning is impossible in the sensuous world the actions of natural causes

are accordingly themselves effects and presuppose causes preceding them in

time a primal action which forms an absolute beginning is beyond the causal

power of phenomena




now is it absolutely necessary that granting that all effects are phenomena

the causality of the cause of these effects must also be a phenomenon and

belong to the empirical world is it not rather possible that although every

effect in the phenomenal world must be connected with an empirical cause

according to the universal law of nature this empirical causality may be

itself the effect of a nonempirical and intelligible causalityits

connection with natural causes remaining nevertheless intact such a causality

would be considered in reference to phenomena as the primal action of a

cause which is in so far therefore not phenomenal but by reason of this

faculty or power intelligible although it must at the same time as a link

in the chain of nature be regarded as belonging to the sensuous world




a belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary if we are

required to look for and to present the natural conditions of natural events

that is to say their causes this being admitted as unexceptionably valid the

requirements of the understanding which recognizes nothing but nature in the

region of phenomena are satisfied and our physical explanations of physical

phenomena may proceed in their regular course without hindrance and without

opposition but it is no stumblingblock in the way even assuming the idea to

be a pure fiction to admit that there are some natural causes in the

possession of a faculty which is not empirical but intelligible inasmuch as

it is not determined to action by empirical conditions but purely and solely

upon grounds brought forward by the understandingthis action being

still when the cause is phenomenized in perfect accordance with the laws of

empirical causality thus the acting subject as a causal phenomenon would

continue to preserve a complete connection with nature and natural conditions

and the phenomenon only of the subject with all its phenomenal causality

would contain certain conditions which if we ascend from the empirical to the

transcendental object must necessarily be regarded as intelligible for if we

attend in our inquiries with regard to causes in the world of phenomena to

the directions of nature alone we need not trouble ourselves about the

relation in which the transcendental subject which is completely unknown to

us stands to these phenomena and their connection in nature the intelligible

ground of phenomena in this subject does not concern empirical questions it

has to do only with pure thought and although the effects of this thought and

action of the pure understanding are discoverable in phenomena these phenomena

must nevertheless be capable of a full and complete explanation upon purely

physical grounds and in accordance with natural laws and in this case we

attend solely to their empirical and omit all consideration of their

intelligible character which is the transcendental cause of the former as

completely unknown except in so far as it is exhibited by the latter as its

empirical symbol now let us apply this to experience man is a phenomenon of

the sensuous world and at the same time therefore a natural cause the

causality of which must be regulated by empirical laws as such he must

possess an empirical character like all other natural phenomena we remark

this empirical character in his actions which reveal the presence of certain

powers and faculties if we consider inanimate or merely animal nature we can

discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any other than a faculty which is

determined in a purely sensuous manner but man to whom nature reveals herself

only through sense cognizes himself not only by his senses but also through

pure apperception and this in actions and internal determinations which he

cannot regard as sensuous impressions he is thus to himself on the one hand

a phenomenon but on the other hand in respect of certain faculties a purely

intelligible objectintelligible because its action cannot be ascribed

to sensuous receptivity these faculties are understanding and reason the

latter especially is in a peculiar manner distinct from all

empiricallyconditioned faculties for it employs ideas alone in the

consideration of its objects and by means of these determines the

understanding which then proceeds to make an empirical use of its own

conceptions which like the ideas of reason are pure and nonempirical




that reason possesses the faculty of causality or that at least we are

compelled so to represent it is evident from the imperatives which in the

sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers the words i

ought express a species of necessity and imply a connection with grounds which

nature does not and cannot present to the mind of man understanding knows

nothing in nature but that which is or has been or will be it would be

absurd to say that anything in nature ought to be other than it is in the

relations of time in which it stands indeed the ought when we consider

merely the course of nature has neither application nor meaning the question

what ought to happen in the sphere of nature is just as absurd

as the question what ought to be the properties of a circle all

that we are entitled to ask is what takes place in nature or

in the latter case what are the properties of a circle




but the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action the ground of

which is a pure conception while the ground of a merely natural action is on

the contrary always a phenomenon this action must certainly be possible under

physical conditions if it is prescribed by the moral imperative ought but

these physical or natural conditions do not concern the determination of the

will itself they relate to its effects alone and the consequences of the

effect in the world of phenomena whatever number of motives nature may present

to my will whatever sensuous impulsesthe moral ought it is beyond their

power to produce they may produce a volition which so far from being

necessary is always conditioneda volition to which the ought enunciated

by reason sets an aim and a standard gives permission or prohibition be the

object what it may purely sensuousas pleasure or presented by pure

reasonas good reason will not yield to grounds which have an empirical

origin reason will not follow the order of things presented by experience

but with perfect spontaneity rearranges them according to ideas with which

it compels empirical conditions to agree it declares in the name of these

ideas certain actions to be necessary which nevertheless have not taken place

and which perhaps never will take place and yet presupposes that it possesses

the faculty of causality in relation to these actions for in the absence of

this supposition it could not expect its ideas to produce certain effects in

the world of experience




now let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reason does

stand in a really causal relation to phenomena in this case it mustpure

reason as it isexhibit an empirical character for every cause supposes

a rule according to which certain phenomena follow as effects from the cause

and every rule requires uniformity in these effects and this is the proper

ground of the conception of a causeas a faculty or power now this

conception of a cause may be termed the empirical character of reason and

this character is a permanent one while the effects produced appear in

conformity with the various conditions which accompany and partly limit them

in various forms




thus the volition of every man has an empirical character which is nothing

more than the causality of his reason in so far as its effects in the

phenomenal world manifest the presence of a rule according to which we are

enabled to examine in their several kinds and degrees the actions of this

causality and the rational grounds for these actions and in this way to decide

upon the subjective principles of the volition now we learn what this

empirical character is only from phenomenal effects and from the rule of these

which is presented by experience and for this reason all the actions of man in

the world of phenomena are determined by his empirical character and the

cooperative causes of nature if then we could investigate all the phenomena

of human volition to their lowest foundation in the mind there would be no

action which we could not anticipate with certainty and recognize to be

absolutely necessary from its preceding conditions so far as relates to this

empirical character therefore there can be no freedom and it is only in the

light of this character that we can consider the human will when we confine

ourselves to simple observation and as is the case in anthropology institute

a physiological investigation of the motive causes of human actions




but when we consider the same actions in relation to reasonnot for the

purpose of explaining their origin that is in relation to speculative reason

but to practical reason as the producing cause of these actionswe shall

discover a rule and an order very different from those of nature and

experience for the declaration of this mental faculty may be that what has and

could not but take place in the course of nature ought not to have taken

place sometimes too we discover or believe that we discover that the ideas

of reason did actually stand in a causal relation to certain actions of man

and that these actions have taken place because they were determined not by

empirical causes but by the act of the will upon grounds of reason




now granting that reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena can an

action of reason be called free when we know that sensuously in its

empirical character it is completely determined and absolutely necessary but

this empirical character is itself determined by the intelligible character

the latter we cannot cognize we can only indicate it by means of phenomena

which enable us to have an immediate cognition only of the empirical

character63 an action then in so far as it is to

be ascribed to an intelligible cause does not result from it in accordance

with empirical laws that is to say not the conditions of pure reason but

only their effects in the internal sense precede the act pure reason as a

purely intelligible faculty is not subject to the conditions of time the

causality of reason in its intelligible character does not begin to be it does

not make its appearance at a certain time for the purpose of producing an

effect if this were not the case the causality of reason would be subservient

to the natural law of phenomena which determines them according to time and

as a series of causes and effects in time it would consequently cease to be

freedom and become a part of nature we are therefore justified in saying

if reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena it is a faculty

which originates the sensuous condition of an empirical series of

effects for the condition which resides in the reason is

nonsensuous and therefore cannot be originated or begin to be and thus we

findwhat we could not discover in any empirical seriesa condition

of a successive series of events itself empirically unconditioned for in the

present case the condition stands out of and beyond the series of

phenomenait is intelligible and it consequently cannot be subjected to

any sensuous condition or to any timedetermination by a preceding cause



 63

the real morality of actionstheir merit or demerit and even that of our

own conduct is completely unknown to us our estimates can relate only to

their empirical character how much is the result of the action of free will

how much is to be ascribed to nature and to blameless error or to a happy

constitution of temperament merito fortunae no one can discover nor for

this reason determine with perfect justice




but in another respect the same cause belongs also to the series of

phenomena man is himself a phenomenon his will has an empirical character

which is the empirical cause of all his actions there is no

conditiondetermining man and his volition in conformity with this

characterwhich does not itself form part of the series of effects in

nature and is subject to their lawthe law according to which an

empirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist for this

reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous origination all

actions being phenomena and belonging to the world of experience but it

cannot be said of reason that the state in which it determines the will is

always preceded by some other state determining it for reason is not a

phenomenon and therefore not subject to sensuous conditions and

consequently even in relation to its causality the sequence or conditions of

time do not influence reason nor can the dynamical law of nature which

determines the sequence of time according to certain rules be applied to it




reason is consequently the permanent condition of all actions of the human

will each of these is determined in the empirical character of the man even

before it has taken place the intelligible character of which the former is

but the sensuous schema knows no before or after and every action

irrespective of the timerelation in which it stands with other phenomena is

the immediate effect of the intelligible character of pure reason which

consequently enjoys freedom of action and is not dynamically determined

either by internal or external preceding conditions this freedom must not be

described in a merely negative manner as independence of empirical

conditions for in this case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of

phenomena but it must be regarded positively as a faculty which can

spontaneously originate a series of events at the same time it must not be

supposed that any beginning can take place in reason on the contrary reason

as the unconditioned condition of all action of the will admits of no

timeconditions although its effect does really begin in a series of

phenomenaa beginning which is not however absolutely primal




i shall illustrate this regulative principle of reason by an example from its

employment in the world of experience proved it cannot be by any amount of

experience or by any number of facts for such arguments cannot establish the

truth of transcendental propositions let us take a voluntary actionfor

example a falsehoodby means of which a man has introduced a certain

degree of confusion into the social life of humanity which is judged according

to the motives from which it originated and the blame of which and of the evil

consequences arising from it is imputed to the offender we at first proceed

to examine the empirical character of the offence and for this purpose we

endeavour to penetrate to the sources of that character such as a defective

education bad company a shameless and wicked disposition frivolity and want

of reflectionnot forgetting also the occasioning causes which prevailed

at the moment of the transgression in this the procedure is exactly the same

as that pursued in the investigation of the series of causes which determine a

given physical effect now although we believe the action to have been

determined by all these circumstances we do not the less blame the offender

we do not blame him for his unhappy disposition nor for the circumstances

which influenced him nay not even for his former course of life for we

presuppose that all these considerations may be set aside that the series of

preceding conditions may be regarded as having never existed and that the

action may be considered as completely unconditioned in relation to any state

preceding just as if the agent commenced with it an entirely new series of

effects our blame of the offender is grounded upon a law of reason which

requires us to regard this faculty as a cause which could have and ought to

have otherwise determined the behaviour of the culprit independently of all

empirical conditions this causality of reason we do not regard as a

cooperating agency but as complete in itself it matters not whether the

sensuous impulses favoured or opposed the action of this causality the offence

is estimated according to its intelligible characterthe offender is

decidedly worthy of blame the moment he utters a falsehood it follows that we

regard reason in spite of the empirical conditions of the act as completely

free and therefore as in the present case culpable




the above judgement is complete evidence that we are accustomed to think that

reason is not affected by sensuous conditions that in it no change takes

placealthough its phenomena in other words the mode in which it

appears in its effects are subject to changethat in it no preceding

state determines the following and consequently that it does not form a

member of the series of sensuous conditions which necessitate phenomena

according to natural laws reason is present and the same in all human actions

and at all times but it does not itself exist in time and therefore does not

enter upon any state in which it did not formerly exist it is relatively to

new states or conditions determining but not determinable hence we cannot

ask why did not reason determine itself in a different manner

the question ought to be thus stated why did not reason employ its

power of causality to determine certain phenomena in a different manner

but this is a question which admits of no answer for a different intelligible

character would have exhibited a different empirical character and when we

say that in spite of the course which his whole former life has taken the

offender could have refrained from uttering the falsehood this means merely

that the act was subject to the power and authoritypermissive or

prohibitiveof reason now reason is not subject in its causality to any

conditions of phenomena or of time and a difference in time may produce a

difference in the relation of phenomena to each otherfor these are not

things and therefore not causes in themselvesbut it cannot produce any

difference in the relation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason




thus then in our investigation into free actions and the causal power which

produced them we arrive at an intelligible cause beyond which however we

cannot go although we can recognize that it is free that is independent of

all sensuous conditions and that in this way it may be the sensuously

unconditioned condition of phenomena but for what reason the intelligible

character generates such and such phenomena and exhibits such and such an

empirical character under certain circumstances it is beyond the power of our

reason to decide the question is as much above the power and the sphere of

reason as the following would be why does the transcendental object of

our external sensuous intuition allow of no other form than that of intuition

in space but the problem which we were called upon to solve does not

require us to entertain any such questions the problem was merely

thiswhether freedom and natural necessity can exist without opposition

in the same action to this question we have given a sufficient answer for we

have shown that as the former stands in a relation to a different kind of

condition from those of the latter the law of the one does not affect the law

of the other and that consequently both can exist together in independence of

and without interference with each other




the reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the above remarks has

not been to prove the actual existence of freedom as a faculty in which

resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena for not to mention that such

an argument would not have a transcendental character nor have been limited to

the discussion of pure conceptionsall attempts at inferring from

experience what cannot be cogitated in accordance with its laws must ever be

unsuccessful nay more i have not even aimed at demonstrating the possibility

of freedom for this too would have been a vain endeavour inasmuch as it is

beyond the power of the mind to cognize the possibility of a reality or of a

causal power by the aid of mere  priori conceptions freedom has been

considered in the foregoing remarks only as a transcendental idea by means of

which reason aims at originating a series of conditions in the world of

phenomena with the help of that which is sensuously unconditioned involving

itself however in an antinomy with the laws which itself prescribes for the

conduct of the understanding that this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion

and that nature and freedom are at least not opposedthis was the only

thing in our power to prove and the question which it was our task to solve


iv solution of the cosmological idea of the totality

of the dependence of phenomenal existences


in the preceding remarks we considered the changes in the world of sense as

constituting a dynamical series in which each member is subordinated to

anotheras its cause our present purpose is to avail ourselves of this

series of states or conditions as a guide to an existence which may be the

highest condition of all changeable phenomena that is to a necessary being

our endeavour to reach not the unconditioned causality but the unconditioned

existence of substance the series before us is therefore a series of

conceptions and not of intuitions in which the one intuition is the condition

of the other




but it is evident that as all phenomena are subject to change and conditioned

in their existence the series of dependent existences cannot embrace an

unconditioned member the existence of which would be absolutely necessary it

follows that if phenomena were things in themselves andas an immediate

consequence from this suppositioncondition and conditioned belonged to

the same series of phenomena the existence of a necessary being as the

condition of the existence of sensuous phenomena would be perfectly

impossible




an important distinction however exists between the dynamical and the

mathematical regress the latter is engaged solely with the combination of

parts into a whole or with the division of a whole into its parts and

therefore are the conditions of its series parts of the series and to be

consequently regarded as homogeneous and for this reason as consisting

without exception of phenomena if the former regress on the contrary the

aim of which is not to establish the possibility of an unconditioned whole

consisting of given parts or of an unconditioned part of a given whole but to

demonstrate the possibility of the deduction of a certain state from its cause

or of the contingent existence of substance from that which exists necessarily

it is not requisite that the condition should form part of an empirical series

along with the conditioned




in the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at present dealing

there exists a way of escape from the difficulty for it is not impossible that

both of the contradictory statements may be true in different relations all

sensuous phenomena may be contingent and consequently possess only an

empirically conditioned existence and yet there may also exist a nonempirical

condition of the whole series or in other words a necessary being for this

necessary being as an intelligible condition would not form a

membernot even the highest memberof the series the whole world

of sense would be left in its empirically determined existence uninterfered

with and uninfluenced this would also form a ground of distinction between the

modes of solution employed for the third and fourth antinomies for while in

the consideration of freedom in the former antinomy the thing itselfthe

cause substantia phaenomenonwas regarded as belonging to the series of

conditions and only its causality to the intelligible worldwe are

obliged in the present case to cogitate this necessary being as purely

intelligible and as existing entirely apart from the world of sense as an ens

extramundanum for otherwise it would be subject to the phenomenal law of

contingency and dependence




in relation to the present problem therefore the regulative principle of

reason is that everything in the sensuous world possesses an empirically

conditioned existencethat no property of the sensuous world possesses

unconditioned necessitythat we are bound to expect and so far as is

possible to seek for the empirical condition of every member in the series of

conditionsand that there is no sufficient reason to justify us in

deducing any existence from a condition which lies out of and beyond the

empirical series or in regarding any existence as independent and

selfsubsistent although this should not prevent us from recognizing the

possibility of the whole series being based upon a being which is intelligible

and for this reason free from all empirical conditions




but it has been far from my intention in these remarks to prove the existence

of this unconditioned and necessary being or even to evidence the possibility

of a purely intelligible condition of the existence of all sensuous phenomena

as bounds were set to reason to prevent it from leaving the guiding thread of

empirical conditions and losing itself in transcendent theories which are

incapable of concrete presentation so it was my purpose on the other hand to

set bounds to the law of the purely empirical understanding and to protest

against any attempts on its part at deciding on the possibility of things or

declaring the existence of the intelligible to be impossible merely on the

ground that it is not available for the explanation and exposition of

phenomena it has been shown at the same time that the contingency of all the

phenomena of nature and their empirical conditions is quite consistent with the

arbitrary hypothesis of a necessary although purely intelligible condition

that no real contradiction exists between them and that consequently both may

be true the existence of such an absolutely necessary being may be impossible

but this can never be demonstrated from the universal contingency and

dependence of sensuous phenomena nor from the principle which forbids us to

discontinue the series at some member of it or to seek for its cause in some

sphere of existence beyond the world of nature reason goes its way in the

empirical world and follows too its peculiar path in the sphere of the

transcendental




the sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena which are mere

representations and always sensuously conditioned things in themselves are

not and cannot be objects to us it is not to be wondered at therefore that

we are not justified in leaping from some member of an empirical series beyond

the world of sense as if empirical representations were things in themselves

existing apart from their transcendental ground in the human mind and the

cause of whose existence may be sought out of the empirical series this would

certainly be the case with contingent things but it cannot be with mere

representations of things the contingency of which is itself merely a

phenomenon and can relate to no other regress than that which determines

phenomena that is the empirical but to cogitate an intelligible ground of

phenomena as free moreover from the contingency of the latter conflicts

neither with the unlimited nature of the empirical regress nor with the

complete contingency of phenomena and the demonstration of this was the only

thing necessary for the solution of this apparent antinomy for if the

condition of every conditionedas regards its existenceis

sensuous and for this reason a part of the same series it must be itself

conditioned as was shown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy the

embarrassments into which a reason which postulates the unconditioned

necessarily falls must therefore continue to exist or the unconditioned

must be placed in the sphere of the intelligible in this way its necessity

does not require nor does it even permit the presence of an empirical

condition and it is consequently unconditionally necessary




the empirical employment of reason is not affected by the assumption of a

purely intelligible being it continues its operations on the principle of the

contingency of all phenomena proceeding from empirical conditions to still

higher and higher conditions themselves empirical just as little does this

regulative principle exclude the assumption of an intelligible cause when the

question regards merely the pure employment of reasonin relation to ends

or aims for in this case an intelligible cause signifies merely the

transcendental and to us unknown ground of the possibility of sensuous

phenomena and its existence necessary and independent of all sensuous

conditions is not inconsistent with the contingency of phenomena or with the

unlimited possibility of regress which exists in the series of empirical

conditions




concluding remarks on the antinomy of pure reason




so long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality of conditions

in the world of phenomena and the satisfaction from this source of the

requirements of reason so long are our ideas transcendental and cosmological

but when we set the unconditionedwhich is the aim of all our

inquiriesin a sphere which lies out of the world of sense and possible

experience our ideas become transcendent they are then not merely serviceable

towards the completion of the exercise of reason which remains an idea never

executed but always to be pursued they detach themselves completely from

experience and construct for themselves objects the material of which has not

been presented by experience and the objective reality of which is not based

upon the completion of the empirical series but upon pure  priori

conceptions the intelligible object of these transcendent ideas may be

conceded as a transcendental object but we cannot cogitate it as a thing

determinable by certain distinct predicates relating to its internal nature

for it has no connection with empirical conceptions nor are we justified in

affirming the existence of any such object it is consequently a mere product

of the mind alone of all the cosmological ideas however it is that

occasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon this step for

the existence of phenomena always conditioned and never selfsubsistent

requires us to look for an object different from phenomenaan

intelligible object with which all contingency must cease but as we have

allowed ourselves to assume the existence of a selfsubsistent reality out of

the field of experience and are therefore obliged to regard phenomena as

merely a contingent mode of representing intelligible objects employed by

beings which are themselves intelligencesno other course remains for us

than to follow analogy and employ the same mode in forming some conception of

intelligible things of which we have not the least knowledge which nature

taught us to use in the formation of empirical conceptions experience made us

acquainted with the contingent but we are at present engaged in the discussion

of things which are not objects of experience and must therefore deduce our

knowledge of them from that which is necessary absolutely and in itself that

is from pure conceptions hence the first step which we take out of the world

of sense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with the investigation

of a necessary being and to deduce from our conceptions of it all our

conceptions of intelligible things this we propose to attempt in the following

chapter


chapter iii the ideal of pure reason
section i of the ideal in general


we have seen that pure conceptions do not present objects to the mind except

under sensuous conditions because the conditions of objective reality do not

exist in these conceptions which contain in fact nothing but the mere form

of thought they may however when applied to phenomena be presented in

concreto for it is phenomena that present to them the materials for the

formation of empirical conceptions which are nothing more than concrete forms

of the conceptions of the understanding but ideas are still further removed

from objective reality than categories for no phenomenon can ever present them

to the human mind in concreto they contain a certain perfection attainable by

no possible empirical cognition and they give to reason a systematic unity to

which the unity of experience attempts to approximate but can never completely

attain




but still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the ideal by

which term i understand the idea not in concreto but in individuoas an

individual thing determinable or determined by the idea alone the idea of

humanity in its complete perfection supposes not only the advancement of all

the powers and faculties which constitute our conception of human nature to a

complete attainment of their final aims but also everything which is requisite

for the complete determination of the idea for of all contradictory

predicates only one can conform with the idea of the perfect man what i have

termed an ideal was in platos philosophy an idea of the divine

mindan individual object present to its pure intuition the most perfect

of every kind of possible beings and the archetype of all phenomenal

existences




without rising to these speculative heights we are bound to confess that human

reason contains not only ideas but ideals which possess not like those of

plato creative but certainly practical poweras regulative principles

and form the basis of the perfectibility of certain actions moral conceptions

are not perfectly pure conceptions of reason because an empirical

elementof pleasure or painlies at the foundation of them in

relation however to the principle whereby reason sets bounds to a freedom

which is in itself without law and consequently when we attend merely to their

form they may be considered as pure conceptions of reason virtue and wisdom

in their perfect purity are ideas but the wise man of the stoics is an ideal

that is to say a human being existing only in thought and in complete

conformity with the idea of wisdom as the idea provides a rule so the ideal

serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination of the copy

thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as a standard of action

with which we may compare and judge ourselves which may help us to reform

ourselves although the perfection it demands can never be attained by us

although we cannot concede objective reality to these ideals they are not to

be considered as chimeras on the contrary they provide reason with a

standard which enables it to estimate by comparison the degree of

incompleteness in the objects presented to it but to aim at realizing the

ideal in an example in the world of experienceto describe for instance

the character of the perfectly wise man in a romanceis impracticable

nay more there is something absurd in the attempt and the result must be

little edifying as the natural limitations which are continually breaking in

upon the perfection and completeness of the idea destroy the illusion in the

story and throw an air of suspicion even on what is good in the idea which

hence appears fictitious and unreal




such is the constitution of the ideal of reason which is always based upon

determinate conceptions and serves as a rule and a model for limitation or of

criticism very different is the nature of the ideals of the imagination of

these it is impossible to present an intelligible conception they are a kind

of monogram drawn according to no determinate rule and forming rather a vague

picturethe production of many diverse experiencesthan a

determinate image such are the ideals which painters and physiognomists

profess to have in their minds and which can serve neither as a model for

production nor as a standard for appreciation they may be termed though

improperly sensuous ideals as they are declared to be models of certain

possible empirical intuitions they cannot however furnish rules or standards

for explanation or examination




in its ideals reason aims at complete and perfect determination according to 

priori rules and hence it cogitates an object which must be completely

determinable in conformity with principles although all empirical conditions

are absent and the conception of the object is on this account transcendent


section ii of the transcendental ideal prototypon

trancendentale


every conception is in relation to that which is not contained in it

undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability this principle is

that of every two contradictorily opposed predicates only one can belong to a

conception it is a purely logical principle itself based upon the principle

of contradiction inasmuch as it makes complete abstraction of the content and

attends merely to the logical form of the cognition




but again everything as regards its possibility is also subject to the

principle of complete determination according to which one of all the possible

contradictory predicates of things must belong to it this principle is not

based merely upon that of contradiction for in addition to the relation

between two contradictory predicates it regards everything as standing in a

relation to the sum of possibilities as the sum total of all predicates of

things and while presupposing this sum as an  priori condition presents to

the mind everything as receiving the possibility of its individual existence

from the relation it bears to and the share it possesses in the aforesaid sum

of possibilities64 the principle of complete determination

relates the content and not to the logical form it is the principle of the

synthesis of all the predicates which are required to constitute the complete

conception of a thing and not a mere principle analytical representation

which enounces that one of two contradictory predicates must belong to a

conception it contains moreover a transcendental presuppositionthat

namely of the material for all possibility which must contain  priori the

data for this or that particular possibility



 64

thus this principle declares everything to possess a relation to a common

correlatethe sumtotal of possibility which if discovered to exist in

the idea of one individual thing would establish the affinity of all possible

things from the identity of the ground of their complete determination the

determinability of every conception is subordinate to the universality

allgemeinheit universalitas of the principle of excluded middle the

determination of a thing to the totality allheit universitas of all possible

predicates




the proposition everything which exists is completely determined means not

only that one of every pair of given contradictory attributes but that one of

all possible attributes is always predicable of the thing in it the

predicates are not merely compared logically with each other but the thing

itself is transcendentally compared with the sumtotal of all possible

predicates the proposition is equivalent to saying to attain to a

complete knowledge of a thing it is necessary to possess a knowledge of

everything that is possible and to determine it thereby in a positive or

negative manner the conception of complete determination is

consequently a conception which cannot be presented in its totality in

concreto and is therefore based upon an idea which has its seat in the

reasonthe faculty which prescribes to the understanding the laws of its

harmonious and perfect exercise




now although this idea of the sumtotal of all possibility in so far as it

forms the condition of the complete determination of everything is itself

undetermined in relation to the predicates which may constitute this sumtotal

and we cogitate in it merely the sumtotal of all possible predicateswe

nevertheless find upon closer examination that this idea as a primitive

conception of the mind excludes a large number of predicatesthose

deduced and those irreconcilable with others and that it is evolved as a

conception completely determined  priori thus it becomes the conception of an

individual object which is completely determined by and through the mere idea

and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason




when we consider all possible predicates not merely logically but

transcendentally that is to say with reference to the content which may be

cogitated as existing in them  priori we shall find that some indicate a

being others merely a nonbeing the logical negation expressed in the word

not does not properly belong to a conception but only to the relation of one

conception to another in a judgement and is consequently quite insufficient to

present to the mind the content of a conception the expression not mortal does

not indicate that a nonbeing is cogitated in the object it does not concern

the content at all a transcendental negation on the contrary indicates

nonbeing in itself and is opposed to transcendental affirmation the

conception of which of itself expresses a being hence this affirmation

indicates a reality because in and through it objects are considered to be

somethingto be things while the opposite negation on the other hand

indicates a mere want or privation or absence and where such negations

alone are attached to a representation the nonexistence of anything

corresponding to the representation




now a negation cannot be cogitated as determined without cogitating at the

same time the opposite affirmation the man born blind has not the least notion

of darkness because he has none of light the vagabond knows nothing of

poverty because he has never known what it is to be in comfort65 the ignorant man has no conception of

his ignorance because he has no conception of knowledge all conceptions of

negatives are accordingly derived or deduced conceptions and realities contain

the data and so to speak the material or transcendental content of the

possibility and complete determination of all things



 65

the investigations and calculations of astronomers have taught us much that is

wonderful but the most important lesson we have received from them is the

discovery of the abyss of our ignorance in relation to the universean

ignorance the magnitude of which reason without the information thus derived

could never have conceived this discovery of our deficiencies must produce a

great change in the determination of the aims of human reason




if therefore a transcendental substratum lies at the foundation of the

complete determination of thingsa substratum which is to form the fund

from which all possible predicates of things are to be supplied this

substratum cannot be anything else than the idea of a sumtotal of reality

omnitudo realitatis in this view negations are nothing but

limitationsa term which could not with propriety be applied to them

if the unlimited the all did not form the true basis of our conception




this conception of a sumtotal of reality is the conception of a thing in

itself regarded as completely determined and the conception of an ens

realissimum is the conception of an individual being inasmuch as it is

determined by that predicate of all possible contradictory predicates which

indicates and belongs to being it is therefore a transcendental ideal which

forms the basis of the complete determination of everything that exists and is

the highest material condition of its possibilitya condition on which

must rest the cogitation of all objects with respect to their content nay

more this ideal is the only proper ideal of which the human mind is capable

because in this case alone a general conception of a thing is completely

determined by and through itself and cognized as the representation of an

individuum




the logical determination of a conception is based upon a disjunctive

syllogism the major of which contains the logical division of the extent of a

general conception the minor limits this extent to a certain part while the

conclusion determines the conception by this part the general conception of a

reality cannot be divided  priori because without the aid of experience we

cannot know any determinate kinds of reality standing under the former as the

genus the transcendental principle of the complete determination of all things

is therefore merely the representation of the sumtotal of all reality it is

not a conception which is the genus of all predicates under itself but one

which comprehends them all within itself the complete determination of a thing

is consequently based upon the limitation of this total of reality so much

being predicated of the thing while all that remains over is excludeda

procedure which is in exact agreement with that of the disjunctive syllogism

and the determination of the objects in the conclusion by one of the members of

the division it follows that reason in laying the transcendental ideal at the

foundation of its determination of all possible things takes a course in exact

analogy with that which it pursues in disjunctive syllogismsa

proposition which formed the basis of the systematic division of all

transcendental ideas according to which they are produced in complete

parallelism with the three modes of syllogistic reasoning employed by the human

mind




it is selfevident that reason in cogitating the necessary complete

determination of things does not presuppose the existence of a being

corresponding to its ideal but merely the idea of the idealfor the

purpose of deducing from the unconditional totality of complete determination

the ideal is therefore the prototype of all things which as defective copies

ectypa receive from it the material of their possibility and approximate to

it more or less though it is impossible that they can ever attain to its

perfection




the possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derivedexcept

that of the thing which contains in itself all reality which must be

considered to be primitive and original for all negationsand they are

the only predicates by means of which all other things can be distinguished

from the ens realissimumare mere limitations of a greater and a

highernay the highest reality and they consequently presuppose this

reality and are as regards their content derived from it the manifold

nature of things is only an infinitely various mode of limiting the conception

of the highest reality which is their common substratum just as all figures

are possible only as different modes of limiting infinite space the object of

the ideal of reasonan object existing only in reason itselfis

also termed the primal being ens originarium as having no existence superior

to him the supreme being ens summum and as being the condition of all other

beings which rank under it the being of all beings ens entium but none of

these terms indicate the objective relation of an actually existing object to

other things but merely that of an idea to conceptions and all our

investigations into this subject still leave us in perfect uncertainty with

regard to the existence of this being




a primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with an existence

which is derivative for the latter presuppose the former and therefore cannot

be constitutive parts of it it follows that the ideal of the primal being must

be cogitated as simple




the deduction of the possibility of all other things from this primal being

cannot strictly speaking be considered as a limitation or as a kind of

division of its reality for this would be regarding the primal being as a mere

aggregatewhich has been shown to be impossible although it was so

represented in our first rough sketch the highest reality must be regarded

rather as the ground than as the sumtotal of the possibility of all things

and the manifold nature of things be based not upon the limitation of the

primal being itself but upon the complete series of effects which flow from

it and thus all our powers of sense as well as all phenomenal reality may be

with propriety regarded as belonging to this series of effects while they

could not have formed parts of the idea considered as an aggregate pursuing

this track and hypostatizing this idea we shall find ourselves authorized to

determine our notion of the supreme being by means of the mere conception of a

highest reality as one simple allsufficient eternal and so onin

one word to determine it in its unconditioned completeness by the aid of every

possible predicate the conception of such a being is the conception of god in

its transcendental sense and thus the ideal of pure reason is the

objectmatter of a transcendental theology




but by such an employment of the transcendental idea we should be over

stepping the limits of its validity and purpose for reason placed it as the

conception of all reality at the basis of the complete determination of

things without requiring that this conception be regarded as the conception of

an objective existence such an existence would be purely fictitious and the

hypostatizing of the content of the idea into an ideal as an individual being

is a step perfectly unauthorized nay more we are not even called upon to

assume the possibility of such an hypothesis as none of the deductions drawn

from such an ideal would affect the complete determination of things in

generalfor the sake of which alone is the idea necessary




it is not sufficient to circumscribe the procedure and the dialectic of reason

we must also endeavour to discover the sources of this dialectic that we may

have it in our power to give a rational explanation of this illusion as a

phenomenon of the human mind for the ideal of which we are at present

speaking is based not upon an arbitrary but upon a natural idea the

question hence arises how happens it that reason regards the possibility of

all things as deduced from a single possibility that to wit of the highest

reality and presupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being




the answer is ready it is at once presented by the procedure of transcendental

analytic the possibility of sensuous objects is a relation of these objects to

thought in which something the empirical form may be cogitated  priori

while that which constitutes the matterthe reality of the phenomenon

that element which corresponds to sensationmust be given from without

as otherwise it could not even be cogitated by nor could its possibility be

presentable to the mind now a sensuous object is completely determined when

it has been compared with all phenomenal predicates and represented by means

of these either positively or negatively but as that which constitutes the

thing itselfthe real in a phenomenon must be given and that in which

the real of all phenomena is given is experience one sole and

allembracingthe material of the possibility of all sensuous objects

must be presupposed as given in a whole and it is upon the limitation of this

whole that the possibility of all empirical objects their distinction from

each other and their complete determination are based now no other objects

are presented to us besides sensuous objects and these can be given only in

connection with a possible experience it follows that a thing is not an object

to us unless it presupposes the whole or sumtotal of empirical reality as the

condition of its possibility now a natural illusion leads us to consider this

principle which is valid only of sensuous objects as valid with regard to

things in general and thus we are induced to hold the empirical principle of

our conceptions of the possibility of things as phenomena by leaving out this

limitative condition to be a transcendental principle of the possibility of

things in general




we proceed afterwards to hypostatize this idea of the sumtotal of all reality

by changing the distributive unity of the empirical exercise of the

understanding into the collective unity of an empirical wholea

dialectical illusion and by cogitating this whole or sum of experience as an

individual thing containing in itself all empirical reality this individual

thing or being is then by means of the abovementioned transcendental

subreption substituted for our notion of a thing which stands at the head of

the possibility of all things the real conditions of whose complete

determination it presents66


 66

this ideal of the ens realissimumalthough merely a mental

representationis first objectivized that is has an objective existence

attributed to it then hypostatized and finally by the natural progress of

reason to the completion of unity personified as we shall show presently for

the regulative unity of experience is not based upon phenomena themselves but

upon the connection of the variety of phenomena by the understanding in a

consciousness and thus the unity of the supreme reality and the complete

determinability of all things seem to reside in a supreme understanding and

consequently in a conscious intelligence


section iii of the arguments employed by speculative

reason in proof of the existence of a supreme being


notwithstanding the pressing necessity which reason feels to form some

presupposition that shall serve the understanding as a proper basis for the

complete determination of its conceptions the idealistic and factitious nature

of such a presupposition is too evident to allow reason for a moment to

persuade itself into a belief of the objective existence of a mere creation of

its own thought but there are other considerations which compel reason to seek

out some resting place in the regress from the conditioned to the

unconditioned which is not given as an actual existence from the mere

conception of it although it alone can give completeness to the series of

conditions and this is the natural course of every human reason even of the

most uneducated although the path at first entered it does not always continue

to follow it does not begin from conceptions but from common experience and

requires a basis in actual existence but this basis is insecure unless it

rests upon the immovable rock of the absolutely necessary and this foundation

is itself unworthy of trust if it leave under and above it empty space if it

do not fill all and leave no room for a why or a wherefore if it be not in

one word infinite in its reality




if we admit the existence of some one thing whatever it may be we must also

admit that there is something which exists necessarily for what is contingent

exists only under the condition of some other thing which is its cause and

from this we must go on to conclude the existence of a cause which is not

contingent and which consequently exists necessarily and unconditionally such

is the argument by which reason justifies its advances towards a primal being




now reason looks round for the conception of a being that may be admitted

without inconsistency to be worthy of the attribute of absolute necessity not

for the purpose of inferring  priori from the conception of such a being its

objective existence for if reason allowed itself to take this course it would

not require a basis in given and actual existence but merely the support of

pure conceptions but for the purpose of discovering among all our

conceptions of possible things that conception which possesses no element

inconsistent with the idea of absolute necessity for that there must be some

absolutely necessary existence it regards as a truth already established now

if it can remove every existence incapable of supporting the attribute of

absolute necessity excepting onethis must be the absolutely necessary

being whether its necessity is comprehensible by us that is deducible from

the conception of it alone or not




now that the conception of which contains a therefore to every wherefore

which is not defective in any respect whatever which is allsufficient as a

condition seems to be the being of which we can justly predicate absolute

necessityfor this reason that possessing the conditions of all that is

possible it does not and cannot itself require any condition and thus it

satisfies in one respect at least the requirements of the conception of

absolute necessity in this view it is superior to all other conceptions

which as deficient and incomplete do not possess the characteristic of

independence of all higher conditions it is true that we cannot infer from

this that what does not contain in itself the supreme and complete

conditionthe condition of all other thingsmust possess only a

conditioned existence but as little can we assert the contrary for this

supposed being does not possess the only characteristic which can enable reason

to cognize by means of an  priori conception the unconditioned and necessary

nature of its existence




the conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with the

conception of an unconditioned and necessary being the former conception does

not satisfy all the requirements of the latter but we have no choice we are

obliged to adhere to it for we find that we cannot do without the existence of

a necessary being and even although we admit it we find it out of our power

to discover in the whole sphere of possibility any being that can advance

wellgrounded claims to such a distinction




the following is therefore the natural course of human reason it begins by

persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being in this being it

recognizes the characteristics of unconditioned existence it then seeks the

conception of that which is independent of all conditions and finds it in that

which is itself the sufficient condition of all other thingsin other

words in that which contains all reality but the unlimited all is an absolute

unity and is conceived by the mind as a being one and supreme and thus reason

concludes that the supreme being as the primal basis of all things possesses

an existence which is absolutely necessary




this conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory if we admit

the existence of a necessary being and consider that there exists a necessity

for a definite and final answer to these questions in such a case we cannot

make a better choice or rather we have no choice at all but feel ourselves

obliged to declare in favour of the absolute unity of complete reality as the

highest source of the possibility of things but if there exists no motive for

coming to a definite conclusion and we may leave the question unanswered till

we have fully weighed both sidesin other words when we are merely

called upon to decide how much we happen to know about the question and how

much we merely flatter ourselves that we knowthe above conclusion does

not appear to be so great advantage but on the contrary seems defective in

the grounds upon which it is supported




for admitting the truth of all that has been said that namely the inference

from a given existence my own for example to the existence of an

unconditioned and necessary being is valid and unassailable that in the

second place we must consider a being which contains all reality and

consequently all the conditions of other things to be absolutely

unconditioned and admitting too that we have thus discovered the conception

of a thing to which may be attributed without inconsistency absolute

necessityit does not follow from all this that the conception of a

limited being in which the supreme reality does not reside is therefore

incompatible with the idea of absolute necessity for although i do not

discover the element of the unconditioned in the conception of such a

beingan element which is manifestly existent in the sumtotal of all

conditionsi am not entitled to conclude that its existence is therefore

conditioned just as i am not entitled to affirm in a hypothetical syllogism

that where a certain condition does not exist in the present completeness as

far as pure conceptions are concerned the conditioned does not exist either

on the contrary we are free to consider all limited beings as likewise

unconditionally necessary although we are unable to infer this from the

general conception which we have of them thus conducted this argument is

incapable of giving us the least notion of the properties of a necessary being

and must be in every respect without result




this argument continues however to possess a weight and an authority which

in spite of its objective insufficiency it has never been divested of for

granting that certain responsibilities lie upon us which as based on the

ideas of reason deserve to be respected and submitted to although they are

incapable of a real or practical application to our nature or in other words

would be responsibilities without motives except upon the supposition of a

supreme being to give effect and influence to the practical laws in such a

case we should be bound to obey our conceptions which although objectively

insufficient do according to the standard of reason preponderate over and

are superior to any claims that may be advanced from any other quarter the

equilibrium of doubt would in this case be destroyed by a practical addition

indeed reason would be compelled to condemn herself if she refused to comply

with the demands of the judgement no superior to which we knowhowever

defective her understanding of the grounds of these demands might be




this argument although in fact transcendental inasmuch as it rests upon the

intrinsic insufficiency of the contingent is so simple and natural that the

commonest understanding can appreciate its value we see things around us

change arise and pass away they or their condition must therefore have a

cause the same demand must again be made of the cause itselfas a datum

of experience now it is natural that we should place the highest causality

just where we place supreme causality in that being which contains the

conditions of all possible effects and the conception of which is so simple as

that of an allembracing reality this highest cause then we regard as

absolutely necessary because we find it absolutely necessary to rise to it

and do not discover any reason for proceeding beyond it thus among all

nations through the darkest polytheism glimmer some faint sparks of

monotheism to which these idolaters have been led not from reflection and

profound thought but by the study and natural progress of the common

understanding




there are only three modes of proving the existence of a deity on the grounds

of speculative reason




all the paths conducting to this end begin either from determinate experience

and the peculiar constitution of the world of sense and rise according to the

laws of causality from it to the highest cause existing apart from the

worldor from a purely indeterminate experience that is some empirical

existenceor abstraction is made of all experience and the existence of

a supreme cause is concluded from  priori conceptions alone the first is the

physicotheological argument the second the cosmological the third the

ontological more there are not and more there cannot be




i shall show it is as unsuccessful on the one paththe empiricalas

on the otherthe transcendental and that it stretches its wings in vain

to soar beyond the world of sense by the mere might of speculative thought as

regards the order in which we must discuss those arguments it will be exactly

the reverse of that in which reason in the progress of its development

attains to themthe order in which they are placed above for it will be

made manifest to the reader that although experience presents the occasion and

the startingpoint it is the transcendental idea of reason which guides it in

its pilgrimage and is the goal of all its struggles i shall therefore begin

with an examination of the transcendental argument and afterwards inquire what

additional strength has accrued to this mode of proof from the addition of the

empirical element


section iv of the impossibility of an ontological

proof of the existence of god


it is evident from what has been said that the conception of an absolutely

necessary being is a mere idea the objective reality of which is far from

being established by the mere fact that it is a need of reason on the

contrary this idea serves merely to indicate a certain unattainable

perfection and rather limits the operations than by the presentation of new

objects extends the sphere of the understanding but a strange anomaly meets

us at the very threshold for the inference from a given existence in general

to an absolutely necessary existence seems to be correct and unavoidable while

the conditions of the understanding refuse to aid us in forming any conception

of such a being




philosophers have always talked of an absolutely necessary being and have

nevertheless declined to take the trouble of conceiving whetherand

howa being of this nature is even cogitable not to mention that its

existence is actually demonstrable a verbal definition of the conception is

certainly easy enough it is something the nonexistence of which is

impossible but does this definition throw any light upon the conditions which

render it impossible to cogitate the nonexistence of a thingconditions

which we wish to ascertain that we may discover whether we think anything in

the conception of such a being or not for the mere fact that i throw away by

means of the word unconditioned all the conditions which the understanding

habitually requires in order to regard anything as necessary is very far from

making clear whether by means of the conception of the unconditionally

necessary i think of something or really of nothing at all




nay more this chanceconception now become so current many have endeavoured

to explain by examples which seemed to render any inquiries regarding its

intelligibility quite needless every geometrical propositiona triangle

has three anglesit was said is absolutely necessary and thus people

talked of an object which lay out of the sphere of our understanding as if it

were perfectly plain what the conception of such a being meant




all the examples adduced have been drawn without exception from judgements

and not from things but the unconditioned necessity of a judgement does not

form the absolute necessity of a thing on the contrary the absolute necessity

of a judgement is only a conditioned necessity of a thing or of the predicate

in a judgement the proposition abovementioned does not enounce that three

angles necessarily exist but upon condition that a triangle exists three

angles must necessarily existin it and thus this logical necessity has

been the source of the greatest delusions having formed an  priori conception

of a thing the content of which was made to embrace existence we believed

ourselves safe in concluding that because existence belongs necessarily to the

object of the conception that is under the condition of my positing this

thing as given the existence of the thing is also posited necessarily and

that it is therefore absolutely necessarymerely because its existence

has been cogitated in the conception




if in an identical judgement i annihilate the predicate in thought and

retain the subject a contradiction is the result and hence i say the former

belongs necessarily to the latter but if i suppress both subject and predicate

in thought no contradiction arises for there is nothing at all and therefore

no means of forming a contradiction to suppose the existence of a triangle and

not that of its three angles is selfcontradictory but to suppose the

nonexistence of both triangle and angles is perfectly admissible and so is it

with the conception of an absolutely necessary being annihilate its existence

in thought and you annihilate the thing itself with all its predicates how

then can there be any room for contradiction externally there is nothing to

give rise to a contradiction for a thing cannot be necessary externally nor

internally for by the annihilation or suppression of the thing itself its

internal properties are also annihilated god is omnipotentthat is a

necessary judgement his omnipotence cannot be denied if the existence of a

deity is positedthe existence that is of an infinite being the two

conceptions being identical but when you say god does not exist neither

omnipotence nor any other predicate is affirmed they must all disappear with

the subject and in this judgement there cannot exist the least

selfcontradiction




you have thus seen that when the predicate of a judgement is annihilated in

thought along with the subject no internal contradiction can arise be the

predicate what it may there is no possibility of evading the

conclusionyou find yourselves compelled to declare there are certain

subjects which cannot be annihilated in thought but this is nothing more than

saying there exist subjects which are absolutely necessarythe very

hypothesis which you are called upon to establish for i find myself unable to

form the slightest conception of a thing which when annihilated in thought with

all its predicates leaves behind a contradiction and contradiction is the

only criterion of impossibility in the sphere of pure  priori conceptions




against these general considerations the justice of which no one can dispute

one argument is adduced which is regarded as furnishing a satisfactory

demonstration from the fact it is affirmed that there is one and only one

conception in which the nonbeing or annihilation of the object is

selfcontradictory and this is the conception of an ens realissimum it

possesses you say all reality and you feel yourselves justified in admitting

the possibility of such a being this i am willing to grant for the present

although the existence of a conception which is not selfcontradictory is far

from being sufficient to prove the possibility of an object67 now the notion of all reality embraces

in it that of existence the notion of existence lies therefore in the

conception of this possible thing if this thing is annihilated in thought the

internal possibility of the thing is also annihilated which is

selfcontradictory



 67

a conception is always possible if it is not selfcontradictory this is the

logical criterion of possibility distinguishing the object of such a

conception from the nihil negativum but it may be notwithstanding an empty

conception unless the objective reality of this synthesis but which it is

generated is demonstrated and a proof of this kind must be based upon

principles of possible experience and not upon the principle of analysis or

contradiction this remark may be serviceable as a warning against concluding

from the possibility of a conceptionwhich is logicalthe

possibility of a thingwhich is real




i answer it is absurd to introduceunder whatever term

disguisedinto the conception of a thing which is to be cogitated solely

in reference to its possibility the conception of its existence if this is

admitted you will have apparently gained the day but in reality have enounced

nothing but a mere tautology i ask is the proposition this or that thing

which i am admitting to be possible exists an analytical or a synthetical

proposition if the former there is no addition made to the subject of your

thought by the affirmation of its existence but then the conception in your

minds is identical with the thing itself or you have supposed the existence of

a thing to be possible and then inferred its existence from its internal

possibilitywhich is but a miserable tautology the word reality in the

conception of the thing and the word existence in the conception of the

predicate will not help you out of the difficulty for supposing you were to

term all positing of a thing reality you have thereby posited the thing with

all its predicates in the conception of the subject and assumed its actual

existence and this you merely repeat in the predicate but if you confess as

every reasonable person must that every existential proposition is

synthetical how can it be maintained that the predicate of existence cannot be

denied without contradictiona property which is the characteristic of

analytical propositions alone




i should have a reasonable hope of putting an end for ever to this sophistical

mode of argumentation by a strict definition of the conception of existence

did not my own experience teach me that the illusion arising from our

confounding a logical with a real predicate a predicate which aids in the

determination of a thing resists almost all the endeavours of explanation and

illustration a logical predicate may be what you please even the subject may

be predicated of itself for logic pays no regard to the content of a

judgement but the determination of a conception is a predicate which adds to

and enlarges the conception it must not therefore be contained in the

conception




being is evidently not a real predicate that is a conception of something

which is added to the conception of some other thing it is merely the positing

of a thing or of certain determinations in it logically it is merely the

copula of a judgement the proposition god is omnipotent contains two

conceptions which have a certain object or content the word is is no

additional predicateit merely indicates the relation of the predicate to

the subject now if i take the subject god with all its predicates

omnipotence being one and say god is or there is a god i add no new

predicate to the conception of god i merely posit or affirm the existence of

the subject with all its predicatesi posit the object in relation to my

conception the content of both is the same and there is no addition made to

the conception which expresses merely the possibility of the object by my

cogitating the objectin the expression it isas absolutely given

or existing thus the real contains no more than the possible a hundred real

dollars contain no more than a hundred possible dollars for as the latter

indicate the conception and the former the object on the supposition that the

content of the former was greater than that of the latter my conception would

not be an expression of the whole object and would consequently be an

inadequate conception of it but in reckoning my wealth there may be said to be

more in a hundred real dollars than in a hundred possible dollarsthat

is in the mere conception of them for the real objectthe

dollarsis not analytically contained in my conception but forms a

synthetical addition to my conception which is merely a determination of my

mental state although this objective realitythis existenceapart

from my conceptions does not in the least degree increase the aforesaid

hundred dollars




by whatever and by whatever number of predicateseven to the complete

determination of iti may cogitate a thing i do not in the least augment

the object of my conception by the addition of the statement this thing

exists otherwise not exactly the same but something more than what was

cogitated in my conception would exist and i could not affirm that the exact

object of my conception had real existence if i cogitate a thing as containing

all modes of reality except one the mode of reality which is absent is not

added to the conception of the thing by the affirmation that the thing exists

on the contrary the thing existsif it exist at allwith the same

defect as that cogitated in its conception otherwise not that which was

cogitated but something different exists now if i cogitate a being as the

highest reality without defect or imperfection the question still

remainswhether this being exists or not for although no element is

wanting in the possible real content of my conception there is a defect in its

relation to my mental state that is i am ignorant whether the cognition of

the object indicated by the conception is possible  posteriori and here the

cause of the present difficulty becomes apparent if the question regarded an

object of sense merely it would be impossible for me to confound the

conception with the existence of a thing for the conception merely enables me

to cogitate an object as according with the general conditions of experience

while the existence of the object permits me to cogitate it as contained in the

sphere of actual experience at the same time this connection with the world

of experience does not in the least augment the conception although a possible

perception has been added to the experience of the mind but if we cogitate

existence by the pure category alone it is not to be wondered at that we

should find ourselves unable to present any criterion sufficient to distinguish

it from mere possibility




whatever be the content of our conception of an object it is necessary to go

beyond it if we wish to predicate existence of the object in the case of

sensuous objects this is attained by their connection according to empirical

laws with some one of my perceptions but there is no means of cognizing the

existence of objects of pure thought because it must be cognized completely 

priori but all our knowledge of existence be it immediately by perception or

by inferences connecting some object with a perception belongs entirely to the

sphere of experiencewhich is in perfect unity with itself and although

an existence out of this sphere cannot be absolutely declared to be impossible

it is a hypothesis the truth of which we have no means of ascertaining




the notion of a supreme being is in many respects a highly useful idea but for

the very reason that it is an idea it is incapable of enlarging our cognition

with regard to the existence of things it is not even sufficient to instruct

us as to the possibility of a being which we do not know to exist the

analytical criterion of possibility which consists in the absence of

contradiction in propositions cannot be denied it but the connection of real

properties in a thing is a synthesis of the possibility of which an  priori

judgement cannot be formed because these realities are not presented to us

specifically and even if this were to happen a judgement would still be

impossible because the criterion of the possibility of synthetical cognitions

must be sought for in the world of experience to which the object of an idea

cannot belong and thus the celebrated leibnitz has utterly failed in his

attempt to establish upon  priori grounds the possibility of this sublime

ideal being




the celebrated ontological or cartesian argument for the existence of a supreme

being is therefore insufficient and we may as well hope to increase our stock

of knowledge by the aid of mere ideas as the merchant to augment his wealth by

the addition of noughts to his cash account


section v of the impossibility of a cosmological

proof of the existence of god


it was by no means a natural course of proceeding but on the contrary an

invention entirely due to the subtlety of the schools to attempt to draw from

a mere idea a proof of the existence of an object corresponding to it such a

course would never have been pursued were it not for that need of reason which

requires it to suppose the existence of a necessary being as a basis for the

empirical regress and that as this necessity must be unconditioned and 

priori reason is bound to discover a conception which shall satisfy if

possible this requirement and enable us to attain to the  priori cognition

of such a being this conception was thought to be found in the idea of an ens

realissimum and thus this idea was employed for the attainment of a better

defined knowledge of a necessary being of the existence of which we were

convinced or persuaded on other grounds thus reason was seduced from her

natural courage and instead of concluding with the conception of an ens

realissimum an attempt was made to begin with it for the purpose of inferring

from it that idea of a necessary existence which it was in fact called in to

complete thus arose that unfortunate ontological argument which neither

satisfies the healthy common sense of humanity nor sustains the scientific

examination of the philosopher




the cosmological proof which we are about to examine retains the connection

between absolute necessity and the highest reality but instead of reasoning

from this highest reality to a necessary existence like the preceding

argument it concludes from the given unconditioned necessity of some being its

unlimited reality the track it pursues whether rational or sophistical is at

least natural and not only goes far to persuade the common understanding but

shows itself deserving of respect from the speculative intellect while it

contains at the same time the outlines of all the arguments employed in

natural theologyarguments which always have been and still will be in

use and authority these however adorned and hid under whatever

embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment are at bottom identical with the

arguments we are at present to discuss this proof termed by leibnitz the

argumentum a contingentia mundi i shall now lay before the reader and subject

to a strict examination




it is framed in the following manner if something exists an absolutely

necessary being must likewise exist now i at least exist consequently

there exists an absolutely necessary being the minor contains an experience

the major reasons from a general experience to the existence of a necessary

being68 thus this argument really begins at

experience and is not completely  priori or ontological the object of all

possible experience being the world it is called the cosmological proof it

contains no reference to any peculiar property of sensuous objects by which

this world of sense might be distinguished from other possible worlds and in

this respect it differs from the physicotheological proof which is based upon

the consideration of the peculiar constitution of our sensuous world



 68

this inference is too well known to require more detailed discussion it is

based upon the spurious transcendental law of causality that everything which

is contingent has a cause which if itself contingent must also have a cause

and so on till the series of subordinated causes must end with an absolutely

necessary cause without which it would not possess completeness




the proof proceeds thus a necessary being can be determined only in one way

that is it can be determined by only one of all possible opposed predicates

consequently it must be completely determined in and by its conception but

there is only a single conception of a thing possible which completely

determines the thing  priori that is the conception of the ens realissimum

it follows that the conception of the ens realissimum is the only conception by

and in which we can cogitate a necessary being consequently a supreme being

necessarily exists




in this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophistical propositions

that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it all her dialectical skill

to produce a transcendental illusion of the most extreme character we shall

postpone an investigation of this argument for the present and confine

ourselves to exposing the stratagem by which it imposes upon us an old argument

in a new dress and appeals to the agreement of two witnesses the one with the

credentials of pure reason and the other with those of empiricism while in

fact it is only the former who has changed his dress and voice for the

purpose of passing himself off for an additional witness that it may possess a

secure foundation it bases its conclusions upon experience and thus appears

to be completely distinct from the ontological argument which places its

confidence entirely in pure  priori conceptions but this experience merely

aids reason in making one stepto the existence of a necessary being

what the properties of this being are cannot be learned from experience and

therefore reason abandons it altogether and pursues its inquiries in the

sphere of pure conception for the purpose of discovering what the properties

of an absolutely necessary being ought to be that is what among all possible

things contain the conditions requisita of absolute necessity reason

believes that it has discovered these requisites in the conception of an ens

realissimumand in it alone and hence concludes the ens realissimum is

an absolutely necessary being but it is evident that reason has here

presupposed that the conception of an ens realissimum is perfectly adequate to

the conception of a being of absolute necessity that is that we may infer the

existence of the latter from that of the formera proposition which

formed the basis of the ontological argument and which is now employed in the

support of the cosmological argument contrary to the wish and professions of

its inventors for the existence of an absolutely necessary being is given in

conceptions alone but if i say the conception of the ens realissimum

is a conception of this kind and in fact the only conception which is adequate

to our idea of a necessary being i am obliged to admit that the latter

may be inferred from the former thus it is properly the ontological argument

which figures in the cosmological and constitutes the whole strength of the

latter while the spurious basis of experience has been of no further use than

to conduct us to the conception of absolute necessity being utterly

insufficient to demonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate

existence or thing for when we propose to ourselves an aim of this character

we must abandon the sphere of experience and rise to that of pure conceptions

which we examine with the purpose of discovering whether any one contains the

conditions of the possibility of an absolutely necessary being but if the

possibility of such a being is thus demonstrated its existence is also proved

for we may then assert that of all possible beings there is one which

possesses the attribute of necessityin other words this being possesses

an absolutely necessary existence




all illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they are presented

in the formal manner employed by the schools which we now proceed to do




if the proposition every absolutely necessary being is likewise an ens

realissimum is correct and it is this which constitutes the nervus

probandi of the cosmological argument it must like all affirmative

judgements be capable of conversionthe conversio per accidens at

least it follows then that some entia realissima are absolutely necessary

beings but no ens realissimum is in any respect different from another and

what is valid of some is valid of all in this present case therefore i may

employ simple conversion and say every ens realissimum is a necessary

being but as this proposition is determined  priori by the conceptions

contained in it the mere conception of an ens realissimum must possess the

additional attribute of absolute necessity but this is exactly what was

maintained in the ontological argument and not recognized by the cosmological

although it formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning




thus the second mode employed by speculative reason of demonstrating the

existence of a supreme being is not only like the first illusory and

inadequate but possesses the additional blemish of an ignoratio

elenchiprofessing to conduct us by a new road to the desired goal but

bringing us back after a short circuit to the old path which we had deserted

at its call




i mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfect nest of

dialectical assumptions which transcendental criticism does not find it

difficult to expose and to dissipate i shall merely enumerate these leaving

it to the reader who must by this time be well practised in such matters to

investigate the fallacies residing therein




the following fallacies for example are discoverable in this mode of proof

1 the transcendental principle everything that is contingent must have

a causea principle without significance except in the sensuous

world for the purely intellectual conception of the contingent cannot produce

any synthetical proposition like that of causality which is itself without

significance or distinguishing characteristic except in the phenomenal world

but in the present case it is employed to help us beyond the limits of its

sphere 2 from the impossibility of an infinite ascending series of

causes in the world of sense a first cause is inferred a conclusion

which the principles of the employment of reason do not justify even in the

sphere of experience and still less when an attempt is made to pass the limits

of this sphere 3 reason allows itself to be satisfied upon insufficient

grounds with regard to the completion of this series it removes all

conditions without which however no conception of necessity can take place

and as after this it is beyond our power to form any other conceptions it

accepts this as a completion of the conception it wishes to form of the series

4 the logical possibility of a conception of the total of reality the

criterion of this possibility being the absence of contradiction is confounded

with the transcendental which requires a principle of the practicability of

such a synthesisa principle which again refers us to the world of

experience and so on




the aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity of proving the

existence of a necessary being priori from mere conceptionsa proof which

must be ontological and of which we feel ourselves quite incapable with this

purpose we reason from an actual existencean experience in general to

an absolutely necessary condition of that existence it is in this case

unnecessary to demonstrate its possibility for after having proved that it

exists the question regarding its possibility is superfluous now when we

wish to define more strictly the nature of this necessary being we do not look

out for some being the conception of which would enable us to comprehend the

necessity of its beingfor if we could do this an empirical

presupposition would be unnecessary no we try to discover merely the negative

condition conditio sine qua non without which a being would not be

absolutely necessary now this would be perfectly admissible in every sort of

reasoning from a consequence to its principle but in the present case it

unfortunately happens that the condition of absolute necessity can be

discovered in but a single being the conception of which must consequently

contain all that is requisite for demonstrating the presence of absolute

necessity and thus entitle me to infer this absolute necessity  priori that

is it must be possible to reason conversely and say the thing to which the

conception of the highest reality belongs is absolutely necessary but if i

cannot reason thusand i cannot unless i believe in the sufficiency of

the ontological argumenti find insurmountable obstacles in my new path

and am really no farther than the point from which i set out the conception of

a supreme being satisfies all questions  priori regarding the internal

determinations of a thing and is for this reason an ideal without equal or

parallel the general conception of it indicating it as at the same time an ens

individuum among all possible things but the conception does not satisfy the

question regarding its existencewhich was the purpose of all our

inquiries and although the existence of a necessary being were admitted we

should find it impossible to answer the question what of all things in the

world must be regarded as such




it is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an allsufficient

beinga cause of all possible effectsfor the purpose of enabling

reason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation with regard

to phenomena but to assert that such a being necessarily exists is no longer

the modest enunciation of an admissible hypothesis but the boldest declaration

of an apodeictic certainty for the cognition of that which is absolutely

necessary must itself possess that character




the aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either to discover a

conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolute necessity or a

conception which shall contain that idea if the one is possible so is the

other for reason recognizes that alone as absolutely necessary which is

necessary from its conception but both attempts are equally beyond our

powerwe find it impossible to satisfy the understanding upon this point

and as impossible to induce it to remain at rest in relation to this

incapacity




unconditioned necessity which as the ultimate support and stay of all

existing things is an indispensable requirement of the mind is an abyss on

the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay even the idea of eternity

terrible and sublime as it is as depicted by haller does not produce upon the

mental vision such a feeling of awe and terror for although it measures the

duration of things it does not support them we cannot bear nor can we rid

ourselves of the thought that a being which we regard as the greatest of all

possible existences should say to himself i am from eternity to eternity

beside me there is nothing except that which exists by my will whence then am

i here all sinks away from under us and the greatest as the smallest

perfection hovers without stay or footing in presence of the speculative

reason which finds it as easy to part with the one as with the other




many physical powers which evidence their existence by their effects are

perfectly inscrutable in their nature they elude all our powers of

observation the transcendental object which forms the basis of phenomena and

in connection with it the reason why our sensibility possesses this rather

than that particular kind of conditions are and must ever remain hidden from

our mental vision the fact is there the reason of the fact we cannot see but

an ideal of pure reason cannot be termed mysterious or inscrutable because the

only credential of its reality is the need of it felt by reason for the

purpose of giving completeness to the world of synthetical unity an ideal is

not even given as a cogitable object and therefore cannot be inscrutable on

the contrary it must as a mere idea be based on the constitution of reason

itself and on this account must be capable of explanation and solution for

the very essence of reason consists in its ability to give an account of all

our conceptions opinions and assertionsupon objective or when they

happen to be illusory and fallacious upon subjective grounds




detection and explanation of the dialectical illusion in all transcendental

arguments for the existence of a necessary being




both of the above arguments are transcendental in other words they do not

proceed upon empirical principles for although the cosmological argument

professed to lay a basis of experience for its edifice of reasoning it did not

ground its procedure upon the peculiar constitution of experience but upon

pure principles of reasonin relation to an existence given by empirical

consciousness utterly abandoning its guidance however for the purpose of

supporting its assertions entirely upon pure conceptions now what is the

cause in these transcendental arguments of the dialectical but natural

illusion which connects the conceptions of necessity and supreme reality and

hypostatizes that which cannot be anything but an idea what is the cause of

this unavoidable step on the part of reason of admitting that some one among

all existing things must be necessary while it falls back from the assertion

of the existence of such a being as from an abyss and how does reason proceed

to explain this anomaly to itself and from the wavering condition of a timid

and reluctant approbationalways again withdrawnarrive at a calm

and settled insight into its cause




it is something very remarkable that on the supposition that something exists

i cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily upon this

perfectly naturalbut not on that account reliableinference does

the cosmological argument rest but let me form any conception whatever of a

thing i find that i cannot cogitate the existence of the thing as absolutely

necessary and that nothing prevents mebe the thing or being what it

mayfrom cogitating its nonexistence i may thus be obliged to admit

that all existing things have a necessary basis while i cannot cogitate any

single or individual thing as necessary in other words i can never complete

the regress through the conditions of existence without admitting the

existence of a necessary being but on the other hand i cannot make a

commencement from this being




if i must cogitate something as existing necessarily as the basis of existing

things and yet am not permitted to cogitate any individual thing as in itself

necessary the inevitable inference is that necessity and contingency are not

properties of things themselvesotherwise an internal contradiction would

result that consequently neither of these principles are objective but merely

subjective principles of reasonthe one requiring us to seek for a

necessary ground for everything that exists that is to be satisfied with no

other explanation than that which is complete  priori the other forbidding us

ever to hope for the attainment of this completeness that is to regard no

member of the empirical world as unconditioned in this mode of viewing them

both principles in their purely heuristic and regulative character and as

concerning merely the formal interest of reason are quite consistent with each

other the one says you must philosophize upon nature as if

there existed a necessary primal basis of all existing things solely for the

purpose of introducing systematic unity into your knowledge by pursuing an

idea of this charactera foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to be

ultimate while the other warns you to consider no individual determination

concerning the existence of things as such an ultimate foundation that is as

absolutely necessary but to keep the way always open for further progress in

the deduction and to treat every determination as determined by some other

but if all that we perceive must be regarded as conditionally necessary it is

impossible that anything which is empirically given should be absolutely

necessary




it follows from this that you must accept the absolutely necessary as out of

and beyond the world inasmuch as it is useful only as a principle of the

highest possible unity in experience and you cannot discover any such

necessary existence in the would the second rule requiring you to regard all

empirical causes of unity as themselves deduced




the philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature as contingent

while matter was considered by them in accordance with the judgement of the

common reason of mankind as primal and necessary but if they had regarded

matter not relativelyas the substratum of phenomena but absolutely and

in itselfas an independent existence this idea of absolute necessity

would have immediately disappeared for there is nothing absolutely connecting

reason with such an existence on the contrary it can annihilate it in

thought always and without selfcontradiction but in thought alone lay the

idea of absolute necessity a regulative principle must therefore have been

at the foundation of this opinion in fact extension and

impenetrabilitywhich together constitute our conception of

matterform the supreme empirical principle of the unity of phenomena

and this principle in so far as it is empirically unconditioned possesses the

property of a regulative principle but as every determination of matter which

constitutes what is real in itand consequently impenetrabilityis

an effect which must have a cause and is for this reason always derived the

notion of matter cannot harmonize with the idea of a necessary being in its

character of the principle of all derived unity for every one of its real

properties being derived must be only conditionally necessary and can

therefore be annihilated in thought and thus the whole existence of matter can

be so annihilated or suppressed if this were not the case we should have

found in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition of

unitywhich is impossible according to the second regulative principle

it follows that matter and in general all that forms part of the world of

sense cannot be a necessary primal being nor even a principle of empirical

unity but that this being or principle must have its place assigned without

the world and in this way we can proceed in perfect confidence to deduce the

phenomena of the world and their existence from other phenomena just as if

there existed no necessary being and we can at the same time strive without

ceasing towards the attainment of completeness for our deduction just as if

such a beingthe supreme condition of all existenceswere

presupposed by the mind




these remarks will have made it evident to the reader that the ideal of the

supreme being far from being an enouncement of the existence of a being in

itself necessary is nothing more than a regulative principle of reason

requiring us to regard all connection existing between phenomena as if it had

its origin from an allsufficient necessary cause and basing upon this the

rule of a systematic and necessary unity in the explanation of phenomena we

cannot at the same time avoid regarding by a transcendental subreptio this

formal principle as constitutive and hypostatizing this unity precisely

similar is the case with our notion of space space is the primal condition of

all forms which are properly just so many different limitations of it and

thus although it is merely a principle of sensibility we cannot help

regarding it as an absolutely necessary and selfsubsistent thingas an

object given  priori in itself in the same way it is quite natural that as

the systematic unity of nature cannot be established as a principle for the

empirical employment of reason unless it is based upon the idea of an ens

realissimum as the supreme cause we should regard this idea as a real object

and this object in its character of supreme condition as absolutely

necessary and that in this way a regulative should be transformed into a

constitutive principle this interchange becomes evident when i regard this

supreme being which relatively to the world was absolutely unconditionally

necessary as a thing per se in this case i find it impossible to represent

this necessity in or by any conception and it exists merely in my own mind as

the formal condition of thought but not as a material and hypostatic condition

of existence


section vi of the impossibility of a

physicotheological proof


if then neither a pure conception nor the general experience of an existing

being can provide a sufficient basis for the proof of the existence of the

deity we can make the attempt by the only other modethat of grounding

our argument upon a determinate experience of the phenomena of the present

world their constitution and disposition and discover whether we can thus

attain to a sound conviction of the existence of a supreme being this argument

we shall term the physicotheological argument if it is shown to be

insufficient speculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof

of the existence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea




it is evident from the remarks that have been made in the preceding sections

that an answer to this question will be far from being difficult or

unconvincing for how can any experience be adequate with an idea the very

essence of an idea consists in the fact that no experience can ever be

discovered congruent or adequate with it the transcendental idea of a

necessary and allsufficient being is so immeasurably great so high above all

that is empirical which is always conditioned that we hope in vain to find

materials in the sphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception

and in vain seek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned while

examples nay even guidance is denied us by the laws of empirical synthesis




if the supreme being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions it must

be a member of the empirical series and like the lower members which it

precedes have its origin in some higher member of the series if on the other

hand we disengage it from the chain and cogitate it as an intelligible being

apart from the series of natural causeshow shall reason bridge the abyss

that separates the latter from the former all laws respecting the regress from

effects to causes all synthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to

possible experience and the objects of the sensuous world and apart from

them are without significance




the world around us opens before our view so magnificent a spectacle of order

variety beauty and conformity to ends that whether we pursue our

observations into the infinity of space in the one direction or into its

illimitable divisions in the other whether we regard the world in its greatest

or its least manifestationseven after we have attained to the highest

summit of knowledge which our weak minds can reach we find that language in

the presence of wonders so inconceivable has lost its force and number its

power to reckon nay even thought fails to conceive adequately and our

conception of the whole dissolves into an astonishment without power of

expressionall the more eloquent that it is dumb everywhere around us we

observe a chain of causes and effects of means and ends of death and birth

and as nothing has entered of itself into the condition in which we find it

we are constantly referred to some other thing which itself suggests the same

inquiry regarding its cause and thus the universe must sink into the abyss of

nothingness unless we admit that besides this infinite chain of

contingencies there exists something that is primal and

selfsubsistentsomething which as the cause of this phenomenal world

secures its continuance and preservation




this highest causewhat magnitude shall we attribute to it of the

content of the world we are ignorant still less can we estimate its magnitude

by comparison with the sphere of the possible but this supreme cause being a

necessity of the human mind what is there to prevent us from attributing to it

such a degree of perfection as to place it above the sphere of all that is

possible this we can easily do although only by the aid of the faint outline

of an abstract conception by representing this being to ourselves as

containing in itself as an individual substance all possible

perfectiona conception which satisfies that requirement of reason which

demands parsimony in principles which is free from selfcontradiction which

even contributes to the extension of the employment of reason in experience by

means of the guidance afforded by this idea to order and system and which in

no respect conflicts with any law of experience




this argument always deserves to be mentioned with respect it is the oldest

the clearest and that most in conformity with the common reason of humanity

it animates the study of nature as it itself derives its existence and draws

ever new strength from that source it introduces aims and ends into a sphere

in which our observation could not of itself have discovered them and extends

our knowledge of nature by directing our attention to a unity the principle

of which lies beyond nature this knowledge of nature again reacts upon this

ideaits cause and thus our belief in a divine author of the universe

rises to the power of an irresistible conviction




for these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this argument

of the authority it has always enjoyed the mind unceasingly elevated by these

considerations which although empirical are so remarkably powerful and

continually adding to their force will not suffer itself to be depressed by

the doubts suggested by subtle speculation it tears itself out of this state

of uncertainty the moment it casts a look upon the wondrous forms of nature

and the majesty of the universe and rises from height to height from

condition to condition till it has elevated itself to the supreme and

unconditioned author of all




but although we have nothing to object to the reasonableness and utility of

this procedure but have rather to commend and encourage it we cannot approve

of the claims which this argument advances to demonstrative certainty and to a

reception upon its own merits apart from favour or support by other arguments

nor can it injure the cause of morality to endeavour to lower the tone of the

arrogant sophist and to teach him that modesty and moderation which are the

properties of a belief that brings calm and content into the mind without

prescribing to it an unworthy subjection i maintain then that the

physicotheological argument is insufficient of itself to prove the existence

of a supreme being that it must entrust this to the ontological

argumentto which it serves merely as an introduction and that

consequently this argument contains the only possible ground of proof

possessed by speculative reason for the existence of this being




the chief momenta in the physicotheological argument are as follow 1 we

observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full of purpose executed

with great wisdom and argument in whole of a content indescribably various

and of an extent without limits 2 this arrangement of means and ends is

entirely foreign to the things existing in the worldit belongs to them

merely as a contingent attribute in other words the nature of different

things could not of itself whatever means were employed harmoniously tend

towards certain purposes were they not chosen and directed for these purposes

by a rational and disposing principle in accordance with certain fundamental

ideas 3 there exists therefore a sublime and wise cause or several which

is not merely a blind allpowerful nature producing the beings and events

which fill the world in unconscious fecundity but a free and intelligent cause

of the world 4 the unity of this cause may be inferred from the unity of the

reciprocal relation existing between the parts of the world as portions of an

artistic edificean inference which all our observation favours and all

principles of analogy support




in the above argument it is inferred from the analogy of certain products of

nature with those of human art when it compels nature to bend herself to its

purposes as in the case of a house a ship or a watch that the same kind of

causalitynamely understanding and willresides in nature it is

also declared that the internal possibility of this freelyacting nature which

is the source of all art and perhaps also of human reason is derivable from

another and superhuman arta conclusion which would perhaps be found

incapable of standing the test of subtle transcendental criticism but to

neither of these opinions shall we at present object we shall only remark that

it must be confessed that if we are to discuss the subject of cause at all we

cannot proceed more securely than with the guidance of the analogy subsisting

between nature and such products of designthese being the only products

whose causes and modes of organization are completely known to us reason would

be unable to satisfy her own requirements if she passed from a causality which

she does know to obscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which

she does not know




according to the physicotheological argument the connection and harmony

existing in the world evidence the contingency of the form merely but not of

the matter that is of the substance of the world to establish the truth of

the latter opinion it would be necessary to prove that all things would be in

themselves incapable of this harmony and order unless they were even as

regards their substance the product of a supreme wisdom but this would

require very different grounds of proof from those presented by the analogy

with human art this proof can at most therefore demonstrate the existence of

an architect of the world whose efforts are limited by the capabilities of the

material with which he works but not of a creator of the world to whom all

things are subject thus this argument is utterly insufficient for the task

before usa demonstration of the existence of an allsufficient being if

we wish to prove the contingency of matter we must have recourse to a

transcendental argument which the physicotheological was constructed

expressly to avoid




we infer from the order and design visible in the universe as a disposition

of a thoroughly contingent character the existence of a cause proportionate

thereto the conception of this cause must contain certain determinate

qualities and it must therefore be regarded as the conception of a being which

possesses all power wisdom and so on in one word all perfectionthe

conception that is of an allsufficient being for the predicates of very

great astonishing or immeasurable power and excellence give us no

determinate conception of the thing nor do they inform us what the thing may

be in itself they merely indicate the relation existing between the magnitude

of the object and the observer who compares it with himself and with his own

power of comprehension and are mere expressions of praise and reverence by

which the object is either magnified or the observing subject depreciated in

relation to the object where we have to do with the magnitude of the

perfection of a thing we can discover no determinate conception except that

which comprehends all possible perfection or completeness and it is only the

total omnitudo of reality which is completely determined in and through its

conception alone




now it cannot be expected that any one will be bold enough to declare that he

has a perfect insight into the relation which the magnitude of the world he

contemplates bears in its extent as well as in its content to omnipotence

into that of the order and design in the world to the highest wisdom and that

of the unity of the world to the absolute unity of a supreme being

physicotheology is therefore incapable of presenting a determinate conception

of a supreme cause of the world and is therefore insufficient as a principle

of theologya theology which is itself to be the basis of religion




the attainment of absolute totality is completely impossible on the path of

empiricism and yet this is the path pursued in the physicotheological

argument what means shall we employ to bridge the abyss




after elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power wisdom

and other attributes of the author of the world and finding we can advance no

further we leave the argument on empirical grounds and proceed to infer the

contingency of the world from the order and conformity to aims that are

observable in it from this contingency we infer by the help of transcendental

conceptions alone the existence of something absolutely necessary and still

advancing proceed from the conception of the absolute necessity of the first

cause to the completely determined or determining conception thereofthe

conception of an allembracing reality thus the physicotheological failing

in its undertaking recurs in its embarrassment to the cosmological argument

and as this is merely the ontological argument in disguise it executes its

design solely by the aid of pure reason although it at first professed to have

no connection with this faculty and to base its entire procedure upon

experience alone




the physicotheologians have therefore no reason to regard with such contempt

the transcendental mode of argument and to look down upon it with the conceit

of clearsighted observers of nature as the braincobweb of obscure

speculatists for if they reflect upon and examine their own arguments they

will find that after following for some time the path of nature and

experience and discovering themselves no nearer their object they suddenly

leave this path and pass into the region of pure possibility where they hope

to reach upon the wings of ideas what had eluded all their empirical

investigations gaining as they think a firm footing after this immense leap

they extend their determinate conceptioninto the possession of which

they have come they know not howover the whole sphere of creation and

explain their ideal which is entirely a product of pure reason by

illustrations drawn from experiencethough in a degree miserably unworthy

of the grandeur of the object while they refuse to acknowledge that they have

arrived at this cognition or hypothesis by a very different road from that of

experience




thus the physicotheological is based upon the cosmological and this upon the

ontological proof of the existence of a supreme being and as besides these

three there is no other path open to speculative reason the ontological proof

on the ground of pure conceptions of reason is the only possible one if any

proof of a proposition so far transcending the empirical exercise of the

understanding is possible at all


section vii critique of all theology based upon

speculative principles of reason


if by the term theology i understand the cognition of a primal being that

cognition is based either upon reason alone theologia rationalis or upon

revelation theologia revelata the former cogitates its object either by

means of pure transcendental conceptions as an ens originarium realissimum

ens entium and is termed transcendental theology or by means of a conception

derived from the nature of our own mind as a supreme intelligence and must

then be entitled natural theology the person who believes in a transcendental

theology alone is termed a deist he who acknowledges the possibility of a

natural theology also a theist the former admits that we can cognize by pure

reason alone the existence of a supreme being but at the same time maintains

that our conception of this being is purely transcendental and that all we can

say of it is that it possesses all reality without being able to define it

more closely the second asserts that reason is capable of presenting us from

the analogy with nature with a more definite conception of this being and

that its operations as the cause of all things are the results of

intelligence and free will the former regards the supreme being as the cause

of the worldwhether by the necessity of his nature or as a free agent

is left undetermined the latter considers this being as the author of the

world




transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a supreme

being from a general experience without any closer reference to the world to

which this experience belongs and in this case it is called cosmotheology or

it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being through mere

conceptions without the aid of experience and is then termed ontotheology




natural theology infers the attributes and the existence of an author of the

world from the constitution of the order and unity observable in the world

in which two modes of causality must be admitted to existthose of nature

and freedom thus it rises from this world to a supreme intelligence either as

the principle of all natural or of all moral order and perfection in the

former case it is termed physicotheology in the latter ethical or

moraltheology69


 69

not theological ethics for this science contains ethical laws which

presuppose the existence of a supreme governor of the world while

moraltheology on the contrary is the expression of a conviction of the

existence of a supreme being founded upon ethical laws




as we are wont to understand by the term god not merely an eternal nature the

operations of which are insensate and blind but a supreme being who is the

free and intelligent author of all things and as it is this latter view alone

that can be of interest to humanity we might in strict rigour deny to the

deist any belief in god at all and regard him merely as a maintainer of the

existence of a primal being or thingthe supreme cause of all other

things but as no one ought to be blamed merely because he does not feel

himself justified in maintaining a certain opinion as if he altogether denied

its truth and asserted the opposite it is more correctas it is less

harshto say the deist believes in a god the theist in a living god

summa intelligentia we shall now proceed to investigate the sources of all

these attempts of reason to establish the existence of a supreme being




it may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge or cognition

as knowledge of that which is and practical knowledge as knowledge of that

which ought to be in this view the theoretical employment of reason is that

by which i cognize  priori as necessary that something is while the

practical is that by which i cognize  priori what ought to happen now if it

is an indubitably certain though at the same time an entirely conditioned

truth that something is or ought to happen either a certain determinate

condition of this truth is absolutely necessary or such a condition may be

arbitrarily presupposed in the former case the condition is postulated per

thesin in the latter supposed per hypothesin there are certain practical

lawsthose of moralitywhich are absolutely necessary now if

these laws necessarily presuppose the existence of some being as the condition

of the possibility of their obligatory power this being must be postulated

because the conditioned from which we reason to this determinate condition is

itself cognized  priori as absolutely necessary we shall at some future time

show that the moral laws not merely presuppose the existence of a supreme

being but also as themselves absolutely necessary in a different relation

demand or postulate italthough only from a practical point of view the

discussion of this argument we postpone for the present




when the question relates merely to that which is not to that which ought to

be the conditioned which is presented in experience is always cogitated as

contingent for this reason its condition cannot be regarded as absolutely

necessary but merely as relatively necessary or rather as needful the

condition is in itself and  priori a mere arbitrary presupposition in aid of

the cognition by reason of the conditioned if then we are to possess a

theoretical cognition of the absolute necessity of a thing we cannot attain to

this cognition otherwise than  priori by means of conceptions while it is

impossible in this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears any

relation to an existence given in experience




theoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object or certain

conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot be discovered by means

of experience it is opposed to the cognition of nature which concerns only

those objects or predicates which can be presented in a possible experience




the principle that everything which happens the empirically contingent must

have a cause is a principle of the cognition of nature but not of speculative

cognition for if we change it into an abstract principle and deprive it of

its reference to experience and the empirical we shall find that it cannot

with justice be regarded any longer as a synthetical proposition and that it

is impossible to discover any mode of transition from that which exists to

something entirely differenttermed cause nay more the conception of a

cause likewise that of the contingentloses in this speculative mode of

employing it all significance for its objective reality and meaning are

comprehensible from experience alone




when from the existence of the universe and the things in it the existence of a

cause of the universe is inferred reason is proceeding not in the natural but

in the speculative method for the principle of the former enounces not that

things themselves or substances but only that which happens or their

statesas empirically contingent have a cause the assertion that the

existence of substance itself is contingent is not justified by experience it

is the assertion of a reason employing its principles in a speculative manner

if again i infer from the form of the universe from the way in which all

things are connected and act and react upon each other the existence of a

cause entirely distinct from the universethis would again be a judgement

of purely speculative reason because the object in this casethe

causecan never be an object of possible experience in both these cases

the principle of causality which is valid only in the field of

experienceuseless and even meaningless beyond this region would be

diverted from its proper destination




now i maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology by the aid

of speculation alone are fruitless that the principles of reason as applied to

nature do not conduct us to any theological truths and consequently that a

rational theology can have no existence unless it is founded upon the laws of

morality for all synthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as

immanent in experience while the cognition of a supreme being necessitates

their being employed transcendentally and of this the understanding is quite

incapable if the empirical law of causality is to conduct us to a supreme

being this being must belong to the chain of empirical objectsin which

case it would be like all phenomena itself conditioned if the possibility of

passing the limits of experience be admitted by means of the dynamical law of

the relation of an effect to its cause what kind of conception shall we obtain

by this procedure certainly not the conception of a supreme being because

experience never presents us with the greatest of all possible effects and it

is only an effect of this character that could witness to the existence of a

corresponding cause if for the purpose of fully satisfying the requirements

of reason we recognize her right to assert the existence of a perfect and

absolutely necessary being this can be admitted only from favour and cannot

be regarded as the result of irresistible demonstration the

physicotheological proof may add weight to othersif other proofs there

areby connecting speculation with experience but in itself it rather

prepares the mind for theological cognition and gives it a right and natural

direction than establishes a sure foundation for theology




it is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only of

transcendental answersthose presented  priori by pure conceptions

without the least empirical admixture but the question in the present case is

evidently syntheticalit aims at the extension of our cognition beyond

the bounds of experienceit requires an assurance respecting the

existence of a being corresponding with the idea in our minds to which no

experience can ever be adequate now it has been abundantly proved that all 

priori synthetical cognition is possible only as the expression of the formal

conditions of a possible experience and that the validity of all principles

depends upon their immanence in the field of experience that is their

relation to objects of empirical cognition or phenomena thus all

transcendental procedure in reference to speculative theology is without

result




if any one prefers doubting the conclusiveness of the proofs of our analytic to

losing the persuasion of the validity of these old and time honoured arguments

he at least cannot decline answering the questionhow he can pass the

limits of all possible experience by the help of mere ideas if he talks of new

arguments or of improvements upon old arguments i request him to spare me

there is certainly no great choice in this sphere of discussion as all

speculative arguments must at last look for support to the ontological and i

have therefore very little to fear from the argumentative fecundity of the

dogmatical defenders of a nonsensuous reason without looking upon myself as a

remarkably combative person i shall not decline the challenge to detect the

fallacy and destroy the pretensions of every attempt of speculative theology

and yet the hope of better fortune never deserts those who are accustomed to

the dogmatical mode of procedure i shall therefore restrict myself to the

simple and equitable demand that such reasoners will demonstrate from the

nature of the human mind as well as from that of the other sources of

knowledge how we are to proceed to extend our cognition completely  priori

and to carry it to that point where experience abandons us and no means exist

of guaranteeing the objective reality of our conceptions in whatever way the

understanding may have attained to a conception the existence of the object of

the conception cannot be discovered in it by analysis because the cognition of

the existence of the object depends upon the objects being posited and

given in itself apart from the conception but it is utterly impossible to go

beyond our conception without the aid of experiencewhich presents to

the mind nothing but phenomena or to attain by the help of mere conceptions to

a conviction of the existence of new kinds of objects or supernatural beings




but although pure speculative reason is far from sufficient to demonstrate the

existence of a supreme being it is of the highest utility in correcting our

conception of this beingon the supposition that we can attain to the

cognition of it by some other meansin making it consistent with itself

and with all other conceptions of intelligible objects clearing it from all

that is incompatible with the conception of an ens summun and eliminating from

it all limitations or admixtures of empirical elements




transcendental theology is still therefore notwithstanding its objective

insufficiency of importance in a negative respect it is useful as a test of

the procedure of reason when engaged with pure ideas no other than a

transcendental standard being in this case admissible for if from a practical

point of view the hypothesis of a supreme and allsufficient being is to

maintain its validity without opposition it must be of the highest importance

to define this conception in a correct and rigorous manneras the

transcendental conception of a necessary being to eliminate all phenomenal

elements anthropomorphism in its most extended signification and at the same

time to overflow all contradictory assertionsbe they atheistic deistic

or anthropomorphic this is of course very easy as the same arguments which

demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirm the existence of a supreme

being must be alike sufficient to prove the invalidity of its denial for it is

impossible to gain from the pure speculation of reason demonstration that there

exists no supreme being as the ground of all that exists or that this being

possesses none of those properties which we regard as analogical with the

dynamical qualities of a thinking being or that as the anthropomorphists

would have us believe it is subject to all the limitations which sensibility

imposes upon those intelligences which exist in the world of experience




a supreme being is therefore for the speculative reason a mere ideal though

a faultless onea conception which perfects and crowns the system of

human cognition but the objective reality of which can neither be proved nor

disproved by pure reason if this defect is ever supplied by a moral theology

the problematic transcendental theology which has preceded will have been at

least serviceable as demonstrating the mental necessity existing for the

conception by the complete determination of it which it has furnished and the

ceaseless testing of the conclusions of a reason often deceived by sense and

not always in harmony with its own ideas the attributes of necessity

infinitude unity existence apart from the world and not as a world soul

eternity free from conditions of time omnipresence free from conditions of

space omnipotence and others are pure transcendental predicates and thus

the accurate conception of a supreme being which every theology requires is

furnished by transcendental theology alone


appendix of the regulative employment of the ideas of

pure reason


the result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason not only confirms the

truth of what we have already proved in our transcendental analytic namely

that all inferences which would lead us beyond the limits of experience are

fallacious and groundless but it at the same time teaches us this important

lesson that human reason has a natural inclination to overstep these limits

and that transcendental ideas are as much the natural property of the reason as

categories are of the understanding there exists this difference however

that while the categories never mislead us outward objects being always in

perfect harmony therewith ideas are the parents of irresistible illusions the

severest and most subtle criticism being required to save us from the fallacies

which they induce




whatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be in harmony

with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers when once we have

discovered their true direction and aim we are entitled to suppose therefore

that there exists a mode of employing transcendental ideas which is proper and

immanent although when we mistake their meaning and regard them as

conceptions of actual things their mode of application is transcendent and

delusive for it is not the idea itself but only the employment of the idea in

relation to possible experience that is transcendent or immanent an idea is

employed transcendently when it is applied to an object falsely believed to be

adequate with and to correspond to it imminently when it is applied solely to

the employment of the understanding in the sphere of experience thus all

errors of subreptioof misapplication are to be ascribed to defects of

judgement and not to understanding or reason




reason never has an immediate relation to an object it relates immediately to

the understanding alone it is only through the understanding that it can be

employed in the field of experience it does not form conceptions of objects

it merely arranges them and gives to them that unity which they are capable of

possessing when the sphere of their application has been extended as widely as

possible reason avails itself of the conception of the understanding for the

sole purpose of producing totality in the different series this totality the

understanding does not concern itself with its only occupation is the

connection of experiences by which series of conditions in accordance with

conceptions are established the object of reason is therefore the

understanding and its proper destination as the latter brings unity into the

diversity of objects by means of its conceptions so the former brings unity

into the diversity of conceptions by means of ideas as it sets the final aim

of a collective unity to the operations of the understanding which without

this occupies itself with a distributive unity alone




i accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employed as

constitutive ideas that they cannot be conceptions of objects and that when

thus considered they assume a fallacious and dialectical character but on

the other hand they are capable of an admirable and indispensably necessary

application to objectsas regulative ideas directing the understanding

to a certain aim the guiding lines towards which all its laws follow and in

which they all meet in one point this pointthough a mere idea focus

imaginarius that is not a point from which the conceptions of the

understanding do really proceed for it lies beyond the sphere of possible

experienceserves notwithstanding to give to these conceptions the

greatest possible unity combined with the greatest possible extension hence

arises the natural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines

proceed from an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition

just as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it but this

illusionwhich we may hinder from imposing upon usis necessary and

unavoidable if we desire to see not only those objects which lie before us

but those which are at a great distance behind us that is to say when in the

present case we direct the aims of the understanding beyond every given

experience towards an extension as great as can possibly be attained




if we review our cognitions in their entire extent we shall find that the

peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system that is to say

to give them connection according to a principle this unity presupposes an

ideathe idea of the form of a whole of cognition preceding the

determinate cognition of the parts and containing the conditions which

determine  priori to every part its place and relation to the other parts of

the whole system this idea accordingly demands complete unity in the

cognition of the understandingnot the unity of a contingent aggregate

but that of a system connected according to necessary laws it cannot be

affirmed with propriety that this idea is a conception of an object it is

merely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions of objects in so

far as this unity is available to the understanding as a rule such conceptions

of reason are not derived from nature on the contrary we employ them for the

interrogation and investigation of nature and regard our cognition as

defective so long as it is not adequate to them we admit that such a thing as

pure earth pure water or pure air is not to be discovered and yet we

require these conceptions which have their origin in the reason so far as

regards their absolute purity and completeness for the purpose of determining

the share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon thus the

different kinds of matter are all referred to earths as mere weight to salts

and inflammable bodies as pure force and finally to water and air as the

vehicula of the former or the machines employed by them in their

operationsfor the purpose of explaining the chemical action and reaction

of bodies in accordance with the idea of a mechanism for although not

actually so expressed the influence of such ideas of reason is very observable

in the procedure of natural philosophers




if reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general and if

the general be certain in se and given it is only necessary that the judgement

should subsume the particular under the general the particular being thus

necessarily determined i shall term this the demonstrative or apodeictic

employment of reason if however the general is admitted as problematical

only and is a mere idea the particular case is certain but the universality

of the rule which applies to this particular case remains a problem several

particular cases the certainty of which is beyond doubt are then taken and

examined for the purpose of discovering whether the rule is applicable to

them and if it appears that all the particular cases which can be collected

follow from the rule its universality is inferred and at the same time all

the causes which have not or cannot be presented to our observation are

concluded to be of the same character with those which we have observed this i

shall term the hypothetical employment of the reason




the hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed as

problematical conceptions is properly not constitutive that is to say if we

consider the subject strictly the truth of the rule which has been employed

as an hypothesis does not follow from the use that is made of it by reason

for how can we know all the possible cases that may arise some of which may

however prove exceptions to the universality of the rule this employment of

reason is merely regulative and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into

the aggregate of our particular cognitions and thereby the approximating of

the rule to universality




the object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore the systematic

unity of cognitions and this unity is the criterion of the truth of a rule on

the other hand this systematic unityas a mere ideais in fact

merely a unity projected not to be regarded as given but only in the light of

a problema problem which serves however as a principle for the various

and particular exercise of the understanding in experience directs it with

regard to those cases which are not presented to our observation and

introduces harmony and consistency into all its operations




all that we can be certain of from the above considerations is that this

systematic unity is a logical principle whose aim is to assist the

understanding where it cannot of itself attain to rules by means of ideas to

bring all these various rules under one principle and thus to ensure the most

complete consistency and connection that can be attained but the assertion

that objects and the understanding by which they are cognized are so

constituted as to be determined to systematic unity that this may be

postulated  priori without any reference to the interest of reason and that

we are justified in declaring all possible cognitionsempirical and

othersto possess systematic unity and to be subject to general

principles from which notwithstanding their various character they are all

derivable such an assertion can be founded only upon a transcendental principle

of reason which would render this systematic unity not subjectively and

logicallyin its character of a method but objectively necessary




we shall illustrate this by an example the conceptions of the understanding

make us acquainted among many other kinds of unity with that of the causality

of a substance which is termed power the different phenomenal manifestations

of the same substance appear at first view to be so very dissimilar that we are

inclined to assume the existence of just as many different powers as there are

different effectsas in the case of the human mind we have feeling

consciousness imagination memory wit analysis pleasure desire and so on

now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce these differences to as small

a number as possible by comparing them and discovering the hidden identity

which exists we must inquire for example whether or not imagination

connected with consciousness memory wit and analysis are not merely

different forms of understanding and reason the idea of a fundamental power

the existence of which no effort of logic can assure us of is the problem to

be solved for the systematic representation of the existing variety of powers

the logical principle of reason requires us to produce as great a unity as is

possible in the system of our cognitions and the more the phenomena of this

and the other power are found to be identical the more probable does it

become that they are nothing but different manifestations of one and the same

power which may be called relatively speaking a fundamental power and so

with other cases




these relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each other to

discover if possible the one radical and absolutely fundamental power of

which they are but the manifestations but this unity is purely hypothetical

it is not maintained that this unity does really exist but that we must in

the interest of reason that is for the establishment of principles for the

various rules presented by experience try to discover and introduce it so far

as is practicable into the sphere of our cognitions




but the transcendental employment of the understanding would lead us to believe

that this idea of a fundamental power is not problematical but that it

possesses objective reality and thus the systematic unity of the various

powers or forces in a substance is demanded by the understanding and erected

into an apodeictic or necessary principle for without having attempted to

discover the unity of the various powers existing in nature nay even after

all our attempts have failed we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist

and may be sooner or later discovered and this reason does not only as in

the case above adduced with regard to the unity of substance but where many

substances although all to a certain extent homogeneous are discoverable as

in the case of matter in general here also does reason presuppose the

existence of the systematic unity of various powersinasmuch as

particular laws of nature are subordinate to general laws and parsimony in

principles is not merely an economical principle of reason but an essential

law of nature




we cannot understand in fact how a logical principle of unity can of right

exist unless we presuppose a transcendental principle by which such a

systematic unitas a property of objects themselvesis regarded as

necessary  priori for with what right can reason in its logical exercise

require us to regard the variety of forces which nature displays as in effect

a disguised unity and to deduce them from one fundamental force or power when

she is free to admit that it is just as possible that all forces should be

different in kind and that a systematic unity is not conformable to the design

of nature in this view of the case reason would be proceeding in direct

opposition to her own destination by setting as an aim an idea which entirely

conflicts with the procedure and arrangement of nature neither can we assert

that reason has previously inferred this unity from the contingent nature of

phenomena for the law of reason which requires us to seek for this unity is a

necessary law inasmuch as without it we should not possess a faculty of

reason nor without reason a consistent and selfaccordant mode of employing

the understanding nor in the absence of this any proper and sufficient

criterion of empirical truth in relation to this criterion therefore we must

suppose the idea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective

validity and necessity




we find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different forms in the

principles of philosophers although they have neither recognized it nor

confessed to themselves its presence that the diversities of individual things

do not exclude identity of species that the various species must be considered

as merely different determinations of a few genera and these again as

divisions of still higher races and so onthat accordingly a certain

systematic unity of all possible empirical conceptions in so far as they can

be deduced from higher and more general conceptions must be sought for is a

scholastic maxim or logical principle without which reason could not be

employed by us for we can infer the particular from the general only in so

far as general properties of things constitute the foundation upon which the

particular rest




that the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers in the

wellknown scholastic maxim which forbids us unnecessarily to augment the

number of entities or principles entia praeter necessitatem non esse

multiplicanda this maxim asserts that nature herself assists in the

establishment of this unity of reason and that the seemingly infinite

diversity of phenomena should not deter us from the expectation of discovering

beneath this diversity a unity of fundamental properties of which the

aforesaid variety is but a more or less determined form this unity although a

mere idea thinkers have found it necessary rather to moderate the desire than

to encourage it it was considered a great step when chemists were able to

reduce all salts to two main generaacids and alkalis and they regard

this difference as itself a mere variety or different manifestation of one and

the same fundamental material the different kinds of earths stones and even

metals chemists have endeavoured to reduce to three and afterwards to two

but still not content with this advance they cannot but think that behind

these diversities there lurks but one genusnay that even salts and

earths have a common principle it might be conjectured that this is merely an

economical plan of reason for the purpose of sparing itself trouble and an

attempt of a purely hypothetical character which when successful gives an

appearance of probability to the principle of explanation employed by the

reason but a selfish purpose of this kind is easily to be distinguished from

the idea according to which every one presupposes that this unity is in

accordance with the laws of nature and that reason does not in this case

request but requires although we are quite unable to determine the proper

limits of this unity




if the diversity existing in phenomenaa diversity not of form for in

this they may be similar but of contentwere so great that the subtlest

human reason could never by comparison discover in them the least similarity

which is not impossible in this case the logical law of genera would be

without foundation the conception of a genus nay all general conceptions

would be impossible and the faculty of the understanding the exercise of

which is restricted to the world of conceptions could not exist the logical

principle of genera accordingly if it is to be applied to nature by which i

mean objects presented to our senses presupposes a transcendental principle

in accordance with this principle homogeneity is necessarily presupposed in

the variety of phenomena although we are unable to determine  priori the

degree of this homogeneity because without it no empirical conceptions and

consequently no experience would be possible




the logical principle of genera which demands identity in phenomena is

balanced by another principlethat of species which requires variety and

diversity in things notwithstanding their accordance in the same genus and

directs the understanding to attend to the one no less than to the other this

principle of the faculty of distinction acts as a check upon the reason and

reason exhibits in this respect a double and conflicting intereston the

one hand the interest in the extent the interest of generality in relation

to genera on the other that of the content the interest of individuality in

relation to the variety of species in the former case the understanding

cogitates more under its conceptions in the latter it cogitates more in them

this distinction manifests itself likewise in the habits of thought peculiar to

natural philosophers some of whomthe remarkably speculative

headsmay be said to be hostile to heterogeneity in phenomena and have

their eyes always fixed on the unity of genera while otherswith a

strong empirical tendencyaim unceasingly at the analysis of phenomena

and almost destroy in us the hope of ever being able to estimate the character

of these according to general principles




the latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle the aim

of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions this principle

authorizes me beginning at the genus to descend to the various and diverse

contained under it and in this way extension as in the former case unity is

assured to the system for if we merely examine the sphere of the conception

which indicates a genus we cannot discover how far it is possible to proceed

in the division of that sphere just as it is impossible from the

consideration of the space occupied by matter to determine how far we can

proceed in the division of it hence every genus must contain different

species and these again different subspecies and as each of the latter must

itself contain a sphere must be of a certain extent as a conceptus communis

reason demands that no species or subspecies is to be considered as the lowest

possible for a species or subspecies being always a conception which

contains only what is common to a number of different things does not

completely determine any individual thing or relate immediately to it and

must consequently contain other conceptions that is other subspecies under

it this law of specification may be thus expressed entium varietates non

temere sunt minuendae




but it is easy to see that this logical law would likewise be without sense or

application were it not based upon a transcendental law of specification

which certainly does not require that the differences existing phenomena should

be infinite in number for the logical principle which merely maintains the

indeterminateness of the logical sphere of a conception in relation to its

possible division does not authorize this statement while it does impose upon

the understanding the duty of searching for subspecies to every species and

minor differences in every difference for were there no lower conceptions

neither could there be any higher now the understanding cognizes only by means

of conceptions consequently how far soever it may proceed in division never

by mere intuition but always by lower and lower conceptions the cognition of

phenomena in their complete determination which is possible only by means of

the understanding requires an unceasingly continued specification of

conceptions and a progression to ever smaller differences of which

abstraction had been made in the conception of the species and still more in

that of the genus




this law of specification cannot be deduced from experience it can never

present us with a principle of so universal an application empirical

specification very soon stops in its distinction of diversities and requires

the guidance of the transcendental law as a principle of the reasona

law which imposes on us the necessity of never ceasing in our search for

differences even although these may not present themselves to the senses that

absorbent earths are of different kinds could only be discovered by obeying the

anticipatory law of reason which imposes upon the understanding the task of

discovering the differences existing between these earths and supposes that

nature is richer in substances than our senses would indicate the faculty of

the understanding belongs to us just as much under the presupposition of

differences in the objects of nature as under the condition that these objects

are homogeneous because we could not possess conceptions nor make any use of

our understanding were not the phenomena included under these conceptions in

some respects dissimilar as well as similar in their character




reason thus prepares the sphere of the understanding for the operations of this

faculty 1 by the principle of the homogeneity of the diverse in higher

genera 2 by the principle of the variety of the homogeneous in lower species

and to complete the systematic unity it adds 3 a law of the affinity of all

conceptions which prescribes a continuous transition from one species to every

other by the gradual increase of diversity we may term these the principles of

the homogeneity the specification and the continuity of forms the latter

results from the union of the two former inasmuch as we regard the systematic

connection as complete in thought in the ascent to higher genera as well as

in the descent to lower species for all diversities must be related to each

other as they all spring from one highest genus descending through the

different gradations of a more and more extended determination




we may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logical principles

in the following manner every conception may be regarded as a point which as

the standpoint of a spectator has a certain horizon which may be said to

enclose a number of things that may be viewed so to speak from that centre

within this horizon there must be an infinite number of other points each of

which has its own horizon smaller and more circumscribed in other words

every species contains subspecies according to the principle of

specification and the logical horizon consists of smaller horizons

subspecies but not of points individuals which possess no extent but

different horizons or genera which include under them so many conceptions may

have one common horizon from which as from a midpoint they may be surveyed

and we may proceed thus till we arrive at the highest genus or universal and

true horizon which is determined by the highest conception and which contains

under itself all differences and varieties as genera species and subspecies




to this highest standpoint i am conducted by the law of homogeneity as to all

lower and more variouslydetermined conceptions by the law of specification

now as in this way there exists no void in the whole extent of all possible

conceptions and as out of the sphere of these the mind can discover nothing

there arises from the presupposition of the universal horizon above mentioned

and its complete division the principle non datur vacuum formarum this

principle asserts that there are not different primitive and highest genera

which stand isolated so to speak from each other but all the various genera

are mere divisions and limitations of one highest and universal genus and

hence follows immediately the principle datur continuum formarum this

principle indicates that all differences of species limit each other and do

not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus but only through

smaller degrees of the difference between the one species and the other in one

word there are no species or subspecies which in the view of reason are the

nearest possible to each other intermediate species or subspecies being

always possible the difference of which from each of the former is always

smaller than the difference existing between these




the first law therefore directs us to avoid the notion that there exist

different primal genera and enounces the fact of perfect homogeneity the

second imposes a check upon this tendency to unity and prescribes the

distinction of subspecies before proceeding to apply our general conceptions

to individuals the third unites both the former by enouncing the fact of

homogeneity as existing even in the most various diversity by means of the

gradual transition from one species to another thus it indicates a

relationship between the different branches or species in so far as they all

spring from the same stem




but this logical law of the continuum specierum formarum logicarum

presupposes a transcendental principle lex continui in natura without which

the understanding might be led into error by following the guidance of the

former and thus perhaps pursuing a path contrary to that prescribed by nature

this law must consequently be based upon pure transcendental and not upon

empirical considerations for in the latter case it would come later than

the system whereas it is really itself the parent of all that is systematic in

our cognition of nature these principles are not mere hypotheses employed for

the purpose of experimenting upon nature although when any such connection is

discovered it forms a solid ground for regarding the hypothetical unity as

valid in the sphere of natureand thus they are in this respect not

without their use but we go farther and maintain that it is manifest that

these principles of parsimony in fundamental causes variety in effects and

affinity in phenomena are in accordance both with reason and nature and that

they are not mere methods or plans devised for the purpose of assisting us in

our observation of the external world




but it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea to which no

adequate object can be discovered in experience and this for two reasons

first because the species in nature are really divided and hence form quanta

discreta and if the gradual progression through their affinity were

continuous the intermediate members lying between two given species must be

infinite in number which is impossible secondly because we cannot make any

determinate empirical use of this law inasmuch as it does not present us with

any criterion of affinity which could aid us in determining how far we ought to

pursue the graduation of differences it merely contains a general indication

that it is our duty to seek for and if possible to discover them




when we arrange these principles of systematic unity in the order conformable

to their employment in experience they will stand thus variety affinity

unity each of them as ideas being taken in the highest degree of their

completeness reason presupposes the existence of cognitions of the

understanding which have a direct relation to experience and aims at the

ideal unity of these cognitionsa unity which far transcends all

experience or empirical notions the affinity of the diverse notwithstanding

the differences existing between its parts has a relation to things but a

still closer one to the mere properties and powers of things for example

imperfect experience may represent the orbits of the planets as circular but

we discover variations from this course and we proceed to suppose that the

planets revolve in a path which if not a circle is of a character very

similar to it that is to say the movements of those planets which do not form

a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of a circle and

probably form an ellipse the paths of comets exhibit still greater variations

for so far as our observation extends they do not return upon their own

course in a circle or ellipse but we proceed to the conjecture that comets

describe a parabola a figure which is closely allied to the ellipse in fact

a parabola is merely an ellipse with its longer axis produced to an indefinite

extent thus these principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms

of these orbits and proceeding farther to a unity as regards the cause of

the motions of the heavenly bodiesthat is gravitation but we go on

extending our conquests over nature and endeavour to explain all seeming

deviations from these rules and even make additions to our system which no

experience can ever substantiatefor example the theory in affinity

with that of ellipses of hyperbolic paths of comets pursuing which these

bodies leave our solar system and passing from sun to sun unite the most

distant parts of the infinite universe which is held together by the same

moving power




the most remarkable circumstance connected with these principles is that they

seem to be transcendental and although only containing ideas for the guidance

of the empirical exercise of reason and although this empirical employment

stands to these ideas in an asymptotic relation alone to use a mathematical

term that is continually approximate without ever being able to attain to

them they possess notwithstanding as  priori synthetical propositions

objective though undetermined validity and are available as rules for possible

experience in the elaboration of our experience they may also be employed

with great advantage as heuristic70 principles a transcendental deduction

of them cannot be made such a deduction being always impossible in the case of

ideas as has been already shown



 70

from the greek eurhioko




we distinguished in the transcendental analytic the dynamical principles of

the understanding which are regulative principles of intuition from the

mathematical which are constitutive principles of intuition these dynamical

laws are however constitutive in relation to experience inasmuch as they

render the conceptions without which experience could not exist possible 

priori but the principles of pure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard

to empirical conceptions because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can

be discovered and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto now if i

grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience as constitutive

principles how shall i secure for them employment and objective validity as

regulative principles and in what way can they be so employed




the understanding is the object of reason as sensibility is the object of the

understanding the production of systematic unity in all the empirical

operations of the understanding is the proper occupation of reason just as it

is the business of the understanding to connect the various content of

phenomena by means of conceptions and subject them to empirical laws but the

operations of the understanding are without the schemata of sensibility

undetermined and in the same manner the unity of reason is perfectly

undetermined as regards the conditions under which and the extent to which

the understanding ought to carry the systematic connection of its conceptions

but although it is impossible to discover in intuition a schema for the

complete systematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding there

must be some analogon of this schema this analogon is the idea of the maximum

of the division and the connection of our cognition in one principle for we

may have a determinate notion of a maximum and an absolutely perfect all the

restrictive conditions which are connected with an indeterminate and various

content having been abstracted thus the idea of reason is analogous with a

sensuous schema with this difference that the application of the categories

to the schema of reason does not present a cognition of any object as is the

case with the application of the categories to sensuous schemata but merely

provides us with a rule or principle for the systematic unity of the exercise

of the understanding now as every principle which imposes upon the exercise

of the understanding  priori compliance with the rule of systematic unity also

relates although only in an indirect manner to an object of experience the

principles of pure reason will also possess objective reality and validity in

relation to experience but they will not aim at determining our knowledge in

regard to any empirical object they will merely indicate the procedure

following which the empirical and determinate exercise of the understanding may

be in complete harmony and connection with itselfa result which is

produced by its being brought into harmony with the principle of systematic

unity so far as that is possible and deduced from it




i term all subjective principles which are not derived from observation of the

constitution of an object but from the interest which reason has in producing

a certain completeness in her cognition of that object maxims of reason thus

there are maxims of speculative reason which are based solely upon its

speculative interest although they appear to be objective principles




when principles which are really regulative are regarded as constitutive and

employed as objective principles contradictions must arise but if they are

considered as mere maxims there is no room for contradictions of any kind as

they then merely indicate the different interests of reason which occasion

differences in the mode of thought in effect reason has only one single

interest and the seeming contradiction existing between her maxims merely

indicates a difference in and a reciprocal limitation of the methods by which

this interest is satisfied




this reasoner has at heart the interest of diversityin accordance with

the principle of specification another the interest of unityin

accordance with the principle of aggregation each believes that his judgement

rests upon a thorough insight into the subject he is examining and yet it has

been influenced solely by a greater or less degree of adherence to some one of

the two principles neither of which are objective but originate solely from

the interest of reason and on this account to be termed maxims rather than

principles when i observe intelligent men disputing about the distinctive

characteristics of men animals or plants and even of minerals those on the

one side assuming the existence of certain national characteristics certain

welldefined and hereditary distinctions of family race and so on while the

other side maintain that nature has endowed all races of men with the same

faculties and dispositions and that all differences are but the result of

external and accidental circumstancesi have only to consider for a

moment the real nature of the subject of discussion to arrive at the

conclusion that it is a subject far too deep for us to judge of and that there

is little probability of either party being able to speak from a perfect

insight into and understanding of the nature of the subject itself both have

in reality been struggling for the twofold interest of reason the one

maintaining the one interest the other the other but this difference between

the maxims of diversity and unity may easily be reconciled and adjusted

although so long as they are regarded as objective principles they must

occasion not only contradictions and polemic but place hinderances in the way

of the advancement of truth until some means is discovered of reconciling

these conflicting interests and bringing reason into union and harmony with

itself




the same is the case with the socalled law discovered by leibnitz and

supported with remarkable ability by bonnetthe law of the continuous

gradation of created beings which is nothing more than an inference from the

principle of affinity for observation and study of the order of nature could

never present it to the mind as an objective truth the steps of this ladder

as they appear in experience are too far apart from each other and the

socalled petty differences between different kinds of animals are in nature

commonly so wide separations that no confidence can be placed in such views

particularly when we reflect on the great variety of things and the ease with

which we can discover resemblances and no faith in the laws which are said to

express the aims and purposes of nature on the other hand the method of

investigating the order of nature in the light of this principle and the maxim

which requires us to regard this orderit being still undetermined how

far it extendsas really existing in nature is beyond doubt a legitimate

and excellent principle of reasona principle which extends farther than

any experience or observation of ours and which without giving us any positive

knowledge of anything in the region of experience guides us to the goal of

systematic unity



of the ultimate end of the natural dialectic of human reason



the ideas of pure reason cannot be of themselves and in their own nature

dialectical it is from their misemployment alone that fallacies and illusions

arise for they originate in the nature of reason itself and it is impossible

that this supreme tribunal for all the rights and claims of speculation should

be itself undeserving of confidence and promotive of error it is to be

expected therefore that these ideas have a genuine and legitimate aim it is

true the mob of sophists raise against reason the cry of inconsistency and

contradiction and affect to despise the government of that faculty because

they cannot understand its constitution while it is to its beneficial

influences alone that they owe the position and the intelligence which enable

them to criticize and to blame its procedure




we cannot employ an  priori conception with certainty until we have made a

transcendental deduction therefore the ideas of pure reason do not admit of

the same kind of deduction as the categories but if they are to possess the

least objective validity and to represent anything but mere creations of

thought entia rationis ratiocinantis a deduction of them must be possible

this deduction will complete the critical task imposed upon pure reason and it

is to this part of our labours that we now proceed




there is a great difference between a things being presented to the mind

as an object in an absolute sense or merely as an ideal object in the former

case i employ my conceptions to determine the object in the latter case

nothing is present to the mind but a mere schema which does not relate

directly to an object not even in a hypothetical sense but which is useful

only for the purpose of representing other objects to the mind in a mediate

and indirect manner by means of their relation to the idea in the intellect

thus i say the conception of a supreme intelligence is a mere idea that is to

say its objective reality does not consist in the fact that it has an

immediate relation to an object for in this sense we have no means of

establishing its objective validity it is merely a schema constructed

according to the necessary conditions of the unity of reasonthe schema

of a thing in general which is useful towards the production of the highest

degree of systematic unity in the empirical exercise of reason in which we

deduce this or that object of experience from the imaginary object of this

idea as the ground or cause of the said object of experience in this way the

idea is properly a heuristic and not an ostensive conception it does not

give us any information respecting the constitution of an object it merely

indicates how under the guidance of the idea we ought to investigate the

constitution and the relations of objects in the world of experience now if

it can be shown that the three kinds of transcendental ideas psychological

cosmological and theological although not relating directly to any object

nor determining it do nevertheless on the supposition of the existence of an

ideal object produce systematic unity in the laws of the empirical employment

of the reason and extend our empirical cognition without ever being

inconsistent or in opposition with itit must be a necessary maxim of

reason to regulate its procedure according to these ideas and this forms the

transcendental deduction of all speculative ideas not as constitutive

principles of the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of our

experience but as regulative principles of the systematic unity of empirical

cognition which is by the aid of these ideas arranged and emended within its

own proper limits to an extent unattainable by the operation of the principles

of the understanding alone




i shall make this plainer guided by the principles involved in these ideas we

must in the first place so connect all the phenomena actions and feelings

of the mind as if it were a simple substance which endowed with personal

identity possesses a permanent existence in this life at least while its

states among which those of the body are to be included as external

conditions are in continual change secondly in cosmology we must

investigate the conditions of all natural phenomena internal as well as

external as if they belonged to a chain infinite and without any prime or

supreme member while we do not on this account deny the existence of

intelligible grounds of these phenomena although we never employ them to

explain phenomena for the simple reason that they are not objects of our

cognition thirdly in the sphere of theology we must regard the whole system

of possible experience as forming an absolute but dependent and

sensuouslyconditioned unity and at the same time as based upon a sole

supreme and allsufficient ground existing apart from the world itselfa

ground which is a selfsubsistent primeval and creative reason in relation to

which we so employ our reason in the field of experience as if all objects

drew their origin from that archetype of all reason in other words we ought

not to deduce the internal phenomena of the mind from a simple thinking

substance but deduce them from each other under the guidance of the regulative

idea of a simple being we ought not to deduce the phenomena order and unity

of the universe from a supreme intelligence but merely draw from this idea of

a supremely wise cause the rules which must guide reason in its connection of

causes and effects




now there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possess an

objective and hyperbolic existence except the cosmological ideas which lead

reason into an antinomy the psychological and theological ideas are not

antinomial they contain no contradiction and how then can any one dispute

their objective reality since he who denies it knows as little about their

possibility as we who affirm and yet when we wish to admit the existence of a

thing it is not sufficient to convince ourselves that there is no positive

obstacle in the way for it cannot be allowable to regard mere creations of

thought which transcend though they do not contradict all our conceptions

as real and determinate objects solely upon the authority of a speculative

reason striving to compass its own aims they cannot therefore be admitted to

be real in themselves they can only possess a comparative realitythat

of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematic unity of all

cognition they are to be regarded not as actual things but as in some measure

analogous to them we abstract from the object of the idea all the conditions

which limit the exercise of our understanding but which on the other hand

are the sole conditions of our possessing a determinate conception of any given

thing and thus we cogitate a something of the real nature of which we have

not the least conception but which we represent to ourselves as standing in a

relation to the whole system of phenomena analogous to that in which phenomena

stand to each other




by admitting these ideal beings we do not really extend our cognitions beyond

the objects of possible experience we extend merely the empirical unity of our

experience by the aid of systematic unity the schema of which is furnished by

the idea which is therefore validnot as a constitutive but as a

regulative principle for although we posit a thing corresponding to the

ideaa something an actual existencewe do not on that account aim

at the extension of our cognition by means of transcendent conceptions this

existence is purely ideal and not objective it is the mere expression of the

systematic unity which is to be the guide of reason in the field of experience

there are no attempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be or

what the real nature of this imaginary being




thus the transcendental and only determinate conception of god which is

presented to us by speculative reason is in the strictest sense deistic in

other words reason does not assure us of the objective validity of the

conception it merely gives us the idea of something on which the supreme and

necessary unity of all experience is based this something we cannot following

the analogy of a real substance cogitate otherwise than as the cause of all

things operating in accordance with rational laws if we regard it as an

individual object although we should rest contented with the idea alone as a

regulative principle of reason and make no attempt at completing the sum of

the conditions imposed by thought this attempt is indeed inconsistent with

the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere of cognitiona

unity to which no bounds are set by reason




hence it happens that admitting a divine being i can have no conception of

the internal possibility of its perfection or of the necessity of its

existence the only advantage of this admission is that it enables me to answer

all other questions relating to the contingent and to give reason the most

complete satisfaction as regards the unity which it aims at attaining in the

world of experience but i cannot satisfy reason with regard to this hypothesis

itself and this proves that it is not its intelligence and insight into the

subject but its speculative interest alone which induces it to proceed from a

point lying far beyond the sphere of our cognition for the purpose of being

able to consider all objects as parts of a systematic whole




here a distinction presents itself in regard to the way in which we may

cogitate a presuppositiona distinction which is somewhat subtle but of

great importance in transcendental philosophy i may have sufficient grounds to

admit something or the existence of something in a relative point of view

suppositio relativa without being justified in admitting it in an absolute

sense suppositio absoluta this distinction is undoubtedly requisite in the

case of a regulative principle the necessity of which we recognize though we

are ignorant of the source and cause of that necessity and which we assume to

be based upon some ultimate ground for the purpose of being able to cogitate

the universality of the principle in a more determinate way for example i

cogitate the existence of a being corresponding to a pure transcendental idea

but i cannot admit that this being exists absolutely and in itself because all

of the conceptions by which i can cogitate an object in a determinate manner

fall short of assuring me of its existence nay the conditions of the

objective validity of my conceptions are excluded by the ideaby the very

fact of its being an idea the conceptions of reality substance causality

nay even that of necessity in existence have no significance out of the

sphere of empirical cognition and cannot beyond that sphere determine any

object they may accordingly be employed to explain the possibility of things

in the world of sense but they are utterly inadequate to explain the

possibility of the universe itself considered as a whole because in this case

the ground of explanation must lie out of and beyond the world and cannot

therefore be an object of possible experience now i may admit the existence

of an incomprehensible being of this naturethe object of a mere idea

relatively to the world of sense although i have no ground to admit its

existence absolutely and in itself for if an idea that of a systematic and

complete unity of which i shall presently speak more particularly lies at the

foundation of the most extended empirical employment of reason and if this

idea cannot be adequately represented in concreto although it is indispensably

necessary for the approximation of empirical unity to the highest possible

degreei am not only authorized but compelled to realize this idea

that is to posit a real object corresponding thereto but i cannot profess to

know this object it is to me merely a something to which as the ground of

systematic unity in cognition i attribute such properties as are analogous to

the conceptions employed by the understanding in the sphere of experience

following the analogy of the notions of reality substance causality and

necessity i cogitate a being which possesses all these attributes in the

highest degree and as this idea is the offspring of my reason alone i

cogitate this being as selfsubsistent reason and as the cause of the universe

operating by means of ideas of the greatest possible harmony and unity thus i

abstract all conditions that would limit my idea solely for the purpose of

rendering systematic unity possible in the world of empirical diversity and

thus securing the widest possible extension for the exercise of reason in that

sphere this i am enabled to do by regarding all connections and relations in

the world of sense as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason of

which our reason is but a faint image i then proceed to cogitate this supreme

being by conceptions which have properly no meaning or application except in

the world of sense but as i am authorized to employ the transcendental

hypothesis of such a being in a relative respect alone that is as the

substratum of the greatest possible unity in experiencei may attribute

to a being which i regard as distinct from the world such properties as belong

solely to the sphere of sense and experience for i do not desire and am not

justified in desiring to cognize this object of my idea as it exists in

itself for i possess no conceptions sufficient for this task those of

reality substance causality nay even that of necessity in existence losing

all significance and becoming merely the signs of conceptions without content

and without applicability when i attempt to carry them beyond the limits of

the world of sense i cogitate merely the relation of a perfectly unknown being

to the greatest possible systematic unity of experience solely for the purpose

of employing it as the schema of the regulative principle which directs reason

in its empirical exercise




it is evident at the first view that we cannot presuppose the reality of this

transcendental object by means of the conceptions of reality substance

causality and so on because these conceptions cannot be applied to anything

that is distinct from the world of sense thus the supposition of a supreme

being or cause is purely relative it is cogitated only in behalf of the

systematic unity of experience such a being is but a something of whose

existence in itself we have not the least conception thus too it becomes

sufficiently manifest why we required the idea of a necessary being in relation

to objects given by sense although we can never have the least conception of

this being or of its absolute necessity




and now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendental dialectic and

the proper aim of the ideas of pure reasonwhich become dialectical

solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness pure reason is in fact

occupied with itself and not with any object objects are not presented to it

to be embraced in the unity of an empirical conception it is only the

cognitions of the understanding that are presented to it for the purpose of

receiving the unity of a rational conception that is of being connected

according to a principle the unity of reason is the unity of system and this

systematic unity is not an objective principle extending its dominion over

objects but a subjective maxim extending its authority over the empirical

cognition of objects the systematic connection which reason gives to the

empirical employment of the understanding not only advances the extension of

that employment but ensures its correctness and thus the principle of a

systematic unity of this nature is also objective although only in an

indefinite respect principium vagum it is not however a constitutive

principle determining an object to which it directly relates it is merely a

regulative principle or maxim advancing and strengthening the empirical

exercise of reason by the opening up of new paths of which the understanding

is ignorant while it never conflicts with the laws of its exercise in the

sphere of experience




but reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity without at the same time

cogitating an object of the ideaan object that cannot be presented in

any experience which contains no concrete example of a complete systematic

unity this being ens rationis ratiocinatae is therefore a mere idea and is

not assumed to be a thing which is real absolutely and in itself on the

contrary it forms merely the problematical foundation of the connection which

the mind introduces among the phenomena of the sensuous world we look upon

this connection in the light of the abovementioned idea as if it drew its

origin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea and yet all we

aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation for the systematic

unity of experiencea unity indispensable to reason advantageous to the

understanding and promotive of the interests of empirical cognition




we mistake the true meaning of this idea when we regard it as an enouncement

or even as a hypothetical declaration of the existence of a real thing which

we are to regard as the origin or ground of a systematic constitution of the

universe on the contrary it is left completely undetermined what the nature

or properties of this socalled ground may be the idea is merely to be adopted

as a point of view from which this unity so essential to reason and so

beneficial to the understanding may be regarded as radiating in one word

this transcendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle by

means of which reason so far as in her lies extends the dominion of

systematic unity over the whole sphere of experience




the first object of an idea of this kind is the ego considered merely as a

thinking nature or soul if i wish to investigate the properties of a thinking

being i must interrogate experience but i find that i can apply none of the

categories to this object the schema of these categories which is the

condition of their application being given only in sensuous intuition but i

cannot thus attain to the cognition of a systematic unity of all the phenomena

of the internal sense instead therefore of an empirical conception of what

the soul really is reason takes the conception of the empirical unity of all

thought and by cogitating this unity as unconditioned and primitive

constructs the rational conception or idea of a simple substance which is in

itself unchangeable possessing personal identity and in connection with other

real things external to it in one word it constructs the idea of a simple

selfsubsistent intelligence but the real aim of reason in this procedure is

the attainment of principles of systematic unity for the explanation of the

phenomena of the soul that is reason desires to be able to represent all the

determinations of the internal sense as existing in one subject all powers as

deduced from one fundamental power all changes as mere varieties in the

condition of a being which is permanent and always the same and all phenomena

in space as entirely different in their nature from the procedure of thought

essential simplicity with the other attributes predicated of the ego is

regarded as the mere schema of this regulative principle it is not assumed

that it is the actual ground of the properties of the soul for these

properties may rest upon quite different grounds of which we are completely

ignorant just as the above predicates could not give us any knowledge of the

soul as it is in itself even if we regarded them as valid in respect of it

inasmuch as they constitute a mere idea which cannot be represented in

concreto nothing but good can result from a psychological idea of this kind

if we only take proper care not to consider it as more than an idea that is

if we regard it as valid merely in relation to the employment of reason in the

sphere of the phenomena of the soul under the guidance of this idea or

principle no empirical laws of corporeal phenomena are called in to explain

that which is a phenomenon of the internal sense alone no windy hypotheses of

the generation annihilation and palingenesis of souls are admitted thus the

consideration of this object of the internal sense is kept pure and unmixed

with heterogeneous elements while the investigation of reason aims at reducing

all the grounds of explanation employed in this sphere of knowledge to a single

principle all this is best effected nay cannot be effected otherwise than by

means of such a schema which requires us to regard this ideal thing as an

actual existence the psychological idea is therefore meaningless and

inapplicable except as the schema of a regulative conception for if i ask

whether the soul is not really of a spiritual natureit is a question

which has no meaning from such a conception has been abstracted not merely

all corporeal nature but all nature that is all the predicates of a possible

experience and consequently all the conditions which enable us to cogitate an

object to this conception have disappeared but if these conditions are

absent it is evident that the conception is meaningless




the second regulative idea of speculative reason is the conception of the

universe for nature is properly the only object presented to us in regard to

which reason requires regulative principles nature is twofoldthinking

and corporeal nature to cogitate the latter in regard to its internal

possibility that is to determine the application of the categories to it no

idea is requiredno representation which transcends experience in this

sphere therefore an idea is impossible sensuous intuition being our only

guide while in the sphere of psychology we require the fundamental idea i

which contains  priori a certain form of thought namely the unity of the ego

pure reason has therefore nothing left but nature in general and the

completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with some principle the

absolute totality of the series of these conditions is an idea which can never

be fully realized in the empirical exercise of reason while it is serviceable

as a rule for the procedure of reason in relation to that totality it requires

us in the explanation of given phenomena in the regress or ascent in the

series to proceed as if the series were infinite in itself that is were

prolonged in indefinitum while on the other hand where reason is regarded as

itself the determining cause in the region of freedom we are required to

proceed as if we had not before us an object of sense but of the pure

understanding in this latter case the conditions do not exist in the series

of phenomena but may be placed quite out of and beyond it and the series of

conditions may be regarded as if it had an absolute beginning from an

intelligible cause all this proves that the cosmological ideas are nothing but

regulative principles and not constitutive and that their aim is not to

realize an actual totality in such series the full discussion of this subject

will be found in its proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure

reason




the third idea of pure reason containing the hypothesis of a being which is

valid merely as a relative hypothesis is that of the one and allsufficient

cause of all cosmological series in other words the idea of god we have not

the slightest ground absolutely to admit the existence of an object

corresponding to this idea for what can empower or authorize us to affirm the

existence of a being of the highest perfectiona being whose existence is

absolutely necessarymerely because we possess the conception of such a

being the answer is it is the existence of the world which renders this

hypothesis necessary but this answer makes it perfectly evident that the idea

of this being like all other speculative ideas is essentially nothing more

than a demand upon reason that it shall regulate the connection which it and

its subordinate faculties introduce into the phenomena of the world by

principles of systematic unity and consequently that it shall regard all

phenomena as originating from one allembracing being as the supreme and

allsufficient cause from this it is plain that the only aim of reason in this

procedure is the establishment of its own formal rule for the extension of its

dominion in the world of experience that it does not aim at an extension of

its cognition beyond the limits of experience and that consequently this

idea does not contain any constitutive principle




the highest formal unity which is based upon ideas alone is the unity of all

thingsa unity in accordance with an aim or purpose and the speculative

interest of reason renders it necessary to regard all order in the world as if

it originated from the intention and design of a supreme reason this principle

unfolds to the view of reason in the sphere of experience new and enlarged

prospects and invites it to connect the phenomena of the world according to

teleological laws and in this way to attain to the highest possible degree of

systematic unity the hypothesis of a supreme intelligence as the sole cause

of the universean intelligence which has for us no more than an ideal

existenceis accordingly always of the greatest service to reason thus

if we presuppose in relation to the figure of the earth which is round but

somewhat flattened at the poles71 or that of mountains or seas wise

designs on the part of an author of the universe we cannot fail to make by

the light of this supposition a great number of interesting discoveries if we

keep to this hypothesis as a principle which is purely regulative even error

cannot be very detrimental for in this case error can have no more serious

consequences than that where we expected to discover a teleological connection

nexus finalis only a mechanical or physical connection appears in such a

case we merely fail to find the additional form of unity we expected but we

do not lose the rational unity which the mind requires in its procedure in

experience but even a miscarriage of this sort cannot affect the law in its

general and teleological relations for although we may convict an anatomist of

an error when he connects the limb of some animal with a certain purpose it

is quite impossible to prove in a single case that any arrangement of nature

be it what it may is entirely without aim or design and thus medical

physiology by the aid of a principle presented to it by pure reason extends

its very limited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the different parts of

an organized body so far that it may be asserted with the utmost confidence

and with the approbation of all reflecting men that every organ or bodily part

of an animal has its use and answers a certain design now this is a

supposition which if regarded as of a constitutive character goes much

farther than any experience or observation of ours can justify hence it is

evident that it is nothing more than a regulative principle of reason which

aims at the highest degree of systematic unity by the aid of the idea of a

causality according to design in a supreme causea cause which it regards

as the highest intelligence



 71

the advantages which a circular form in the case of the earth has over every

other are well known but few are aware that the slight flattening at the

poles which gives it the figure of a spheroid is the only cause which

prevents the elevations of continents or even of mountains perhaps thrown up

by some internal convulsion from continually altering the position of the axis

of the earthand that to some considerable degree in a short time the

great protuberance of the earth under the equator serves to overbalance the

impetus of all other masses of earth and thus to preserve the axis of the

earth so far as we can observe in its present position and yet this wise

arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the equilibrium of the

formerly fluid mass




if however we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purely regulative

influence reason is betrayed into numerous errors for it has then left the

ground of experience in which alone are to be found the criteria of truth and

has ventured into the region of the incomprehensible and unsearchable on the

heights of which it loses its power and collectedness because it has

completely severed its connection with experience




the first error which arises from our employing the idea of a supreme being as

a constitutive in repugnance to the very nature of an idea and not as a

regulative principle is the error of inactive reason ignava ratio72 we may so term every principle which

requires us to regard our investigations of nature as absolutely complete and

allows reason to cease its inquiries as if it had fully executed its task

thus the psychological idea of the ego when employed as a constitutive

principle for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul and for the

extension of our knowledge regarding this subject beyond the limits of

experienceeven to the condition of the soul after deathis

convenient enough for the purposes of pure reason but detrimental and even

ruinous to its interests in the sphere of nature and experience the

dogmatizing spiritualist explains the unchanging unity of our personality

through all changes of condition from the unity of a thinking substance the

interest which we take in things and events that can happen only after our

death from a consciousness of the immaterial nature of our thinking subject

and so on thus he dispenses with all empirical investigations into the cause

of these internal phenomena and with all possible explanations of them upon

purely natural grounds while at the dictation of a transcendent reason he

passes by the immanent sources of cognition in experience greatly to his own

ease and convenience but to the sacrifice of all genuine insight and

intelligence these prejudicial consequences become still more evident in the

case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of a supreme intelligence and the

theological system of nature physicotheology which is falsely based upon it

for in this case the aims which we observe in nature and often those which

we merely fancy to exist make the investigation of causes a very easy task by

directing us to refer such and such phenomena immediately to the unsearchable

will and counsel of the supreme wisdom while we ought to investigate their

causes in the general laws of the mechanism of matter we are thus recommended

to consider the labour of reason as ended when we have merely dispensed with

its employment which is guided surely and safely only by the order of nature

and the series of changes in the worldwhich are arranged according to

immanent and general laws this error may be avoided if we do not merely

consider from the viewpoint of final aims certain parts of nature such as the

division and structure of a continent the constitution and direction of

certain mountainchains or even the organization existing in the vegetable and

animal kingdoms but look upon this systematic unity of nature in a perfectly

general way in relation to the idea of a supreme intelligence if we pursue

this advice we lay as a foundation for all investigation the conformity to

aims of all phenomena of nature in accordance with universal laws for which no

particular arrangement of nature is exempt but only cognized by us with more

or less difficulty and we possess a regulative principle of the systematic

unity of a teleological connection which we do not attempt to anticipate or

predetermine all that we do and ought to do is to follow out the

physicomechanical connection in nature according to general laws with the

hope of discovering sooner or later the teleological connection also thus

and thus only can the principle of final unity aid in the extension of the

employment of reason in the sphere of experience without being in any case

detrimental to its interests



 72

this was the term applied by the old dialecticians to a sophistical argument

which ran thus if it is your fate to die of this disease you will die

whether you employ a physician or not cicero says that this mode of reasoning

has received this appellation because if followed it puts an end to the

employment of reason in the affairs of life for a similar reason i have

applied this designation to the sophistical argument of pure reason




the second error which arises from the misconception of the principle of

systematic unity is that of perverted reason perversa ratio usteron roteron

rationis the idea of systematic unity is available as a regulative principle

in the connection of phenomena according to general natural laws and how far

soever we have to travel upon the path of experience to discover some fact or

event this idea requires us to believe that we have approached all the more

nearly to the completion of its use in the sphere of nature although that

completion can never be attained but this error reverses the procedure of

reason we begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity and by

giving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a supreme

intelligence and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature thus not

only does teleology which ought to aid in the completion of unity in

accordance with general laws operate to the destruction of its influence but

it hinders reason from attaining its proper aim that is the proof upon

natural grounds of the existence of a supreme intelligent cause for if we

cannot presuppose supreme finality in nature  priori that is as essentially

belonging to nature how can we be directed to endeavour to discover this unity

and rising gradually through its different degrees to approach the supreme

perfection of an author of alla perfection which is absolutely

necessary and therefore cognizable  priori the regulative principle directs

us to presuppose systematic unity absolutely and consequently as following

from the essential nature of thingsbut only as a unity of nature not

merely cognized empirically but presupposed  priori although only in an

indeterminate manner but if i insist on basing nature upon the foundation of a

supreme ordaining being the unity of nature is in effect lost for in this

case it is quite foreign and unessential to the nature of things and cannot

be cognized from the general laws of nature and thus arises a vicious circular

argument what ought to have been proved having been presupposed




to take the regulative principle of systematic unity in nature for a

constitutive principle and to hypostatize and make a cause out of that which

is properly the ideal ground of the consistent and harmonious exercise of

reason involves reason in inextricable embarrassments the investigation of

nature pursues its own path under the guidance of the chain of natural causes

in accordance with the general laws of nature and ever follows the light of

the idea of an author of the universenot for the purpose of deducing the

finality which it constantly pursues from this supreme being but to attain

to the cognition of his existence from the finality which it seeks in the

existence of the phenomena of nature and if possible in that of all things

to cognize this being consequently as absolutely necessary whether this

latter purpose succeed or not the idea is and must always be a true one and

its employment when merely regulative must always be accompanied by truthful

and beneficial results




complete unity in conformity with aims constitutes absolute perfection but

if we do not find this unity in the nature of the things which go to constitute

the world of experience that is of objective cognition consequently in the

universal and necessary laws of nature how can we infer from this unity the

idea of the supreme and absolutely necessary perfection of a primal being

which is the origin of all causality the greatest systematic unity and

consequently teleological unity constitutes the very foundation of the

possibility of the most extended employment of human reason the idea of unity

is therefore essentially and indissolubly connected with the nature of our

reason this idea is a legislative one and hence it is very natural that we

should assume the existence of a legislative reason corresponding to it from

which the systematic unity of naturethe object of the operations of

reasonmust be derived




in the course of our discussion of the antinomies we stated that it is always

possible to answer all the questions which pure reason may raise and that the

plea of the limited nature of our cognition which is unavoidable and proper in

many questions regarding natural phenomena cannot in this case be admitted

because the questions raised do not relate to the nature of things but are

necessarily originated by the nature of reason itself and relate to its own

internal constitution we can now establish this assertion which at first

sight appeared so rash in relation to the two questions in which reason takes

the greatest interest and thus complete our discussion of the dialectic of

pure reason




if then the question is asked in relation to transcendental theology73 first whether there is anything

distinct from the world which contains the ground of cosmical order and

connection according to general laws the answer is certainly for the world

is a sum of phenomena there must therefore be some transcendental basis of

these phenomena that is a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone

if secondly the question is asked whether this being is substance whether it

is of the greatest reality whether it is necessary and so forth i answer

that this question is utterly without meaning for all the categories which aid

me in forming a conception of an object cannot be employed except in the world

of sense and are without meaning when not applied to objects of actual or

possible experience out of this sphere they are not properly conceptions but

the mere marks or indices of conceptions which we may admit although they

cannot without the help of experience help us to understand any subject or

thing if thirdly the question is whether we may not cogitate this being

which is distinct from the world in analogy with the objects of experience

the answer is undoubtedly but only as an ideal and not as a real object

that is we must cogitate it only as an unknown substratum of the systematic

unity order and finality of the worlda unity which reason must employ

as the regulative principle of its investigation of nature nay more we may

admit into the idea certain anthropomorphic elements which are promotive of

the interests of this regulative principle for it is no more than an idea

which does not relate directly to a being distinct from the world but to the

regulative principle of the systematic unity of the world by means however

of a schema of this unitythe schema of a supreme intelligence who is

the wiselydesigning author of the universe what this basis of cosmical unity

may be in itself we know notwe cannot discover from the idea we merely

know how we ought to employ the idea of this unity in relation to the

systematic operation of reason in the sphere of experience



 73

after what has been said of the psychological idea of the ego and its proper

employment as a regulative principle of the operations of reason i need not

enter into details regarding the transcendental illusion by which the

systematic unity of all the various phenomena of the internal sense is

hypostatized the procedure is in this case very similar to that which has been

discussed in our remarks on the theological ideal




but it will be asked again can we on these grounds admit the existence of a

wise and omnipotent author of the world without doubt and not only so but we

must assume the existence of such a being but do we thus extend the limits of

our knowledge beyond the field of possible experience by no means for we have

merely presupposed a something of which we have no conception which we do not

know as it is in itself but in relation to the systematic disposition of the

universe which we must presuppose in all our observation of nature we have

cogitated this unknown being in analogy with an intelligent existence an

empirical conception that is to say we have endowed it with those

attributes which judging from the nature of our own reason may contain the

ground of such a systematic unity this idea is therefore valid only relatively

to the employment in experience of our reason but if we attribute to it

absolute and objective validity we overlook the fact that it is merely an

ideal being that we cogitate and by setting out from a basis which is not

determinable by considerations drawn from experience we place ourselves in a

position which incapacitates us from applying this principle to the empirical

employment of reason




but it will be asked further can i make any use of this conception and

hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature yes for this very

purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental basis but may i

regard certain arrangements which seemed to have been made in conformity with

some fixed aim as the arrangements of design and look upon them as proceeding

from the divine will with the intervention however of certain other

particular arrangements disposed to that end yes you may do so but at the

same time you must regard it as indifferent whether it is asserted that divine

wisdom has disposed all things in conformity with his highest aims or that the

idea of supreme wisdom is a regulative principle in the investigation of

nature and at the same time a principle of the systematic unity of nature

according to general laws even in those cases where we are unable to discover

that unity in other words it must be perfectly indifferent to you whether you

say when you have discovered this unity god has wisely willed it so or

nature has wisely arranged this for it was nothing but the systematic unity

which reason requires as a basis for the investigation of nature that

justified you in accepting the idea of a supreme intelligence as a schema for a

regulative principle and the farther you advance in the discovery of design

and finality the more certain the validity of your idea but as the whole aim

of this regulative principle was the discovery of a necessary and systematic

unity in nature we have in so far as we attain this to attribute our success

to the idea of a supreme being while at the same time we cannot without

involving ourselves in contradictions overlook the general laws of nature as

it was in reference to them alone that this idea was employed we cannot i

say overlook the general laws of nature and regard this conformity to aims

observable in nature as contingent or hyperphysical in its origin inasmuch as

there is no ground which can justify us in the admission of a being with such

properties distinct from and above nature all that we are authorized to assert

is that this idea may be employed as a principle and that the properties of

the being which is assumed to correspond to it may be regarded as

systematically connected in analogy with the causal determination of phenomena




for the same reasons we are justified in introducing into the idea of the

supreme cause other anthropomorphic elements for without these we could not

predicate anything of it we may regard it as allowable to cogitate this cause

as a being with understanding the feelings of pleasure and displeasure and

faculties of desire and will corresponding to these at the same time we may

attribute to this being infinite perfectiona perfection which

necessarily transcends that which our knowledge of the order and design in the

world authorize us to predicate of it for the regulative law of systematic

unity requires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic and final

unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable even in the highest diversity

for although we may discover little of this cosmical perfection it belongs to

the legislative prerogative of reason to require us always to seek for and to

expect it while it must always be beneficial to institute all inquiries into

nature in accordance with this principle but it is evident that by this idea

of a supreme author of all which i place as the foundation of all inquiries

into nature i do not mean to assert the existence of such a being or that i

have any knowledge of its existence and consequently i do not really deduce

anything from the existence of this being but merely from its idea that is to

say from the nature of things in this world in accordance with this idea a

certain dim consciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated

to the philosophers of all times the moderate language used by them regarding

the cause of the world we find them employing the expressions wisdom and care

of nature and divine wisdom as synonymousnay in purely speculative

discussions preferring the former because it does not carry the appearance of

greater pretensions than such as we are entitled to make and at the same time

directs reason to its proper field of actionnature and her phenomena




thus pure reason which at first seemed to promise us nothing less than the

extension of our cognition beyond the limits of experience is found when

thoroughly examined to contain nothing but regulative principles the virtue

and function of which is to introduce into our cognition a higher degree of

unity than the understanding could of itself these principles by placing the

goal of all our struggles at so great a distance realize for us the most

thorough connection between the different parts of our cognition and the

highest degree of systematic unity but on the other hand if misunderstood

and employed as constitutive principles of transcendent cognition they become

the parents of illusions and contradictions while pretending to introduce us

to new regions of knowledge




thus all human cognition begins with intuitions proceeds from thence to

conceptions and ends with ideas although it possesses in relation to all

three elements  priori sources of cognition which seemed to transcend the

limits of all experience a thoroughgoing criticism demonstrates that

speculative reason can never by the aid of these elements pass the bounds of

possible experience and that the proper destination of this highest faculty of

cognition is to employ all methods and all the principles of these methods

for the purpose of penetrating into the innermost secrets of nature by the aid

of the principles of unity among all kinds of which teleological unity is the

highest while it ought not to attempt to soar above the sphere of experience

beyond which there lies nought for us but the void inane the critical

examination in our transcendental analytic of all the propositions which

professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere of experience completely

demonstrated that they can only conduct us to a possible experience if we were

not distrustful even of the clearest abstract theorems if we were not allured

by specious and inviting prospects to escape from the constraining power of

their evidence we might spare ourselves the laborious examination of all the

dialectical arguments which a transcendent reason adduces in support of its

pretensions for we should know with the most complete certainty that however

honest such professions might be they are null and valueless because they

relate to a kind of knowledge to which no man can by any possibility attain

but as there is no end to discussion if we cannot discover the true cause of

the illusions by which even the wisest are deceived and as the analysis of all

our transcendent cognition into its elements is of itself of no slight value as

a psychological study while it is a duty incumbent on every

philosopherit was found necessary to investigate the dialectical

procedure of reason in its primary sources and as the inferences of which this

dialectic is the parent are not only deceitful but naturally possess a

profound interest for humanity it was advisable at the same time to give a

full account of the momenta of this dialectical procedure and to deposit it in

the archives of human reason as a warning to all future metaphysicians to

avoid these causes of speculative error




ii transcendental doctrine of method


if we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as an edifice

the idea of which at least exists in the human mind it may be said that we

have in the transcendental doctrine of elements examined the materials and

determined to what edifice these belong and what its height and stability we

have found indeed that although we had purposed to build for ourselves a

tower which should reach to heaven the supply of materials sufficed merely for

a habitation which was spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes and high

enough to enable us to survey the level plain of experience but that the bold

undertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materialsnot to

mention the confusion of tongues which gave rise to endless disputes among the

labourers on the plan of the edifice and at last scattered them over all the

world each to erect a separate building for himself according to his own

plans and his own inclinations our present task relates not to the materials

but to the plan of an edifice and as we have had sufficient warning not to

venture blindly upon a design which may be found to transcend our natural

powers while at the same time we cannot give up the intention of erecting a

secure abode for the mind we must proportion our design to the material which

is presented to us and which is at the same time sufficient for all our

wants




i understand then by the transcendental doctrine of method the determination

of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure reason we shall

accordingly have to treat of the discipline the canon the architectonic and

finally the history of pure reason this part of our critique will accomplish

from the transcendental point of view what has been usually attempted but

miserably executed under the name of practical logic it has been badly

executed i say because general logic not being limited to any particular

kind of cognition not even to the pure cognition of the understanding nor to

any particular objects it cannot without borrowing from other sciences do

more than present merely the titles or signs of possible methods and the

technical expressions which are employed in the systematic parts of all

sciences and thus the pupil is made acquainted with names the meaning and

application of which he is to learn only at some future time


chapter i the discipline of pure reason


negative judgementsthose which are so not merely as regards their

logical form but in respect of their contentare not commonly held in

especial respect they are on the contrary regarded as jealous enemies of our

insatiable desire for knowledge and it almost requires an apology to induce us

to tolerate much less to prize and to respect them




all propositions indeed may be logically expressed in a negative form but

in relation to the content of our cognition the peculiar province of negative

judgements is solely to prevent error for this reason too negative

propositions which are framed for the purpose of correcting false cognitions

where error is absolutely impossible are undoubtedly true but inane and

senseless that is they are in reality purposeless and for this reason often

very ridiculous such is the proposition of the schoolman that alexander could

not have subdued any countries without an army




but where the limits of our possible cognition are very much contracted the

attraction to new fields of knowledge great the illusions to which the mind is

subject of the most deceptive character and the evil consequences of error of

no inconsiderable magnitudethe negative element in knowledge which is

useful only to guard us against error is of far more importance than much of

that positive instruction which makes additions to the sum of our knowledge

the restraint which is employed to repress and finally to extirpate the

constant inclination to depart from certain rules is termed discipline it is

distinguished from culture which aims at the formation of a certain degree of

skill without attempting to repress or to destroy any other mental power

already existing in the cultivation of a talent which has given evidence of

an impulse towards selfdevelopment discipline takes a negative74 culture and doctrine a positive part



 74

i am well aware that in the language of the schools the term discipline is

usually employed as synonymous with instruction but there are so many cases in

which it is necessary to distinguish the notion of the former as a course of

corrective training from that of the latter as the communication of

knowledge and the nature of things itself demands the appropriation of the

most suitable expressions for this distinction that it is my desire that the

former terms should never be employed in any other than a negative

signification




that natural dispositions and talents such as imagination and wit which ask

a free and unlimited development require in many respects the corrective

influence of discipline every one will readily grant but it may well appear

strange that reason whose proper duty it is to prescribe rules of discipline

to all the other powers of the mind should itself require this corrective it

has in fact hitherto escaped this humiliation only because in presence of

its magnificent pretensions and high position no one could readily suspect it

to be capable of substituting fancies for conceptions and words for things




reason when employed in the field of experience does not stand in need of

criticism because its principles are subjected to the continual test of

empirical observations nor is criticism requisite in the sphere of

mathematics where the conceptions of reason must always be presented in

concreto in pure intuition and baseless or arbitrary assertions are discovered

without difficulty but where reason is not held in a plain track by the

influence of empirical or of pure intuition that is when it is employed in

the transcendental sphere of pure conceptions it stands in great need of

discipline to restrain its propensity to overstep the limits of possible

experience and to keep it from wandering into error in fact the utility of

the philosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character

particular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions and the causes

of these errors may be eradicated by criticism but where we find as in the

case of pure reason a complete system of illusions and fallacies closely

connected with each other and depending upon grand general principles there

seems to be required a peculiar and negative code of mental legislation which

under the denomination of a discipline and founded upon the nature of reason

and the objects of its exercise shall constitute a system of thorough

examination and testing which no fallacy will be able to withstand or escape

from under whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk




but the reader must remark that in this the second division of our

transcendental critique the discipline of pure reason is not directed to the

content but to the method of the cognition of pure reason the former task has

been completed in the doctrine of elements but there is so much similarity in

the mode of employing the faculty of reason whatever be the object to which it

is applied while at the same time its employment in the transcendental

sphere is so essentially different in kind from every other that without the

warning negative influence of a discipline specially directed to that end the

errors are unavoidable which spring from the unskillful employment of the

methods which are originated by reason but which are out of place in this

sphere


section i the discipline of pure reason in the sphere

of dogmatism


the science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of the extension

of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience examples are always

contagious and they exert an especial influence on the same faculty which

naturally flatters itself that it will have the same good fortune in other case

as fell to its lot in one fortunate instance hence pure reason hopes to be

able to extend its empire in the transcendental sphere with equal success and

security especially when it applies the same method which was attended with

such brilliant results in the science of mathematics it is therefore of the

highest importance for us to know whether the method of arriving at

demonstrative certainty which is termed mathematical be identical with that

by which we endeavour to attain the same degree of certainty in philosophy and

which is termed in that science dogmatical




philosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means of conceptions

mathematical cognition is cognition by means of the construction of

conceptions the construction of a conception is the presentation  priori of

the intuition which corresponds to the conception for this purpose a

nonempirical intuition is requisite which as an intuition is an individual

object while as the construction of a conception a general representation

it must be seen to be universally valid for all the possible intuitions which

rank under that conception thus i construct a triangle by the presentation of

the object which corresponds to this conception either by mere imagination in

pure intuition or upon paper in empirical intuition in both cases completely

 priori without borrowing the type of that figure from any experience the

individual figure drawn upon paper is empirical but it serves

notwithstanding to indicate the conception even in its universality because

in this empirical intuition we keep our eye merely on the act of the

construction of the conception and pay no attention to the various modes of

determining it for example its size the length of its sides the size of its

angles these not in the least affecting the essential character of the

conception




philosophical cognition accordingly regards the particular only in the

general mathematical the general in the particular nay in the individual

this is done however entirely  priori and by means of pure reason so that

as this individual figure is determined under certain universal conditions of

construction the object of the conception to which this individual figure

corresponds as its schema must be cogitated as universally determined




the essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists therefore

in this formal quality it does not regard the difference of the matter or

objects of both those thinkers who aim at distinguishing philosophy from

mathematics by asserting that the former has to do with quality merely and the

latter with quantity have mistaken the effect for the cause the reason why

mathematical cognition can relate only to quantity is to be found in its form

alone for it is the conception of quantities only that is capable of being

constructed that is presented  priori in intuition while qualities cannot

be given in any other than an empirical intuition hence the cognition of

qualities by reason is possible only through conceptions no one can find an

intuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality except in

experience it cannot be presented to the mind  priori and antecedently to the

empirical consciousness of a reality we can form an intuition by means of the

mere conception of it of a cone without the aid of experience but the colour

of the cone we cannot know except from experience i cannot present an

intuition of a cause except in an example which experience offers to me

besides philosophy as well as mathematics treats of quantities as for

example of totality infinity and so on mathematics too treats of the

difference of lines and surfacesas spaces of different quality of the

continuity of extensionas a quality thereof but although in such cases

they have a common object the mode in which reason considers that object is

very different in philosophy from what it is in mathematics the former

confines itself to the general conceptions the latter can do nothing with a

mere conception it hastens to intuition in this intuition it regards the

conception in concreto not empirically but in an  priori intuition which it

has constructed and in which all the results which follow from the general

conditions of the construction of the conception are in all cases valid for the

object of the constructed conception




suppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher and that he

is required to discover by the philosophical method what relation the sum of

its angles bears to a right angle he has nothing before him but the conception

of a figure enclosed within three right lines and consequently with the same

number of angles he may analyse the conception of a right line of an angle

or of the number three as long as he pleases but he will not discover any

properties not contained in these conceptions but if this question is

proposed to a geometrician he at once begins by constructing a triangle he

knows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguous angles

which proceed from one point in a straight line and he goes on to produce one

side of his triangle thus forming two adjacent angles which are together equal

to two right angles he then divides the exterior of these angles by drawing a

line parallel with the opposite side of the triangle and immediately perceives

that he has thus got an exterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior

proceeding in this way through a chain of inferences and always on the ground

of intuition he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of the

question




but mathematics does not confine itself to the construction of quantities

quanta as in the case of geometry it occupies itself with pure quantity

also quantitas as in the case of algebra where complete abstraction is made

of the properties of the object indicated by the conception of quantity in

algebra a certain method of notation by signs is adopted and these indicate

the different possible constructions of quantities the extraction of roots

and so on after having thus denoted the general conception of quantities

according to their different relations the different operations by which

quantity or number is increased or diminished are presented in intuition in

accordance with general rules thus when one quantity is to be divided by

another the signs which denote both are placed in the form peculiar to the

operation of division and thus algebra by means of a symbolical construction

of quantity just as geometry with its ostensive or geometrical construction

a construction of the objects themselves arrives at results which discursive

cognition cannot hope to reach by the aid of mere conceptions




now what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the philosopher and

the mathematician the former of whom follows the path of conceptions while

the latter pursues that of intuitions which he represents  priori in

correspondence with his conceptions the cause is evident from what has been

already demonstrated in the introduction to this critique we do not in the

present case want to discover analytical propositions which may be produced

merely by analysing our conceptionsfor in this the philosopher would

have the advantage over his rival we aim at the discovery of synthetical

propositionssuch synthetical propositions moreover as can be cognized

 priori i must not confine myself to that which i actually cogitate in my

conception of a triangle for this is nothing more than the mere definition i

must try to go beyond that and to arrive at properties which are not contained

in although they belong to the conception now this is impossible unless i

determine the object present to my mind according to the conditions either of

empirical or of pure intuition in the former case i should have an

empirical proposition arrived at by actual measurement of the angles of the

triangle which would possess neither universality nor necessity but that

would be of no value in the latter i proceed by geometrical construction by

means of which i collect in a pure intuition just as i would in an empirical

intuition all the various properties which belong to the schema of a triangle

in general and consequently to its conception and thus construct synthetical

propositions which possess the attribute of universality




it would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle that is to reflect on it

discursively i should get no further than the definition with which i had been

obliged to set out there are certainly transcendental synthetical propositions

which are framed by means of pure conceptions and which form the peculiar

distinction of philosophy but these do not relate to any particular thing but

to a thing in general and enounce the conditions under which the perception of

it may become a part of possible experience but the science of mathematics has

nothing to do with such questions nor with the question of existence in any

fashion it is concerned merely with the properties of objects in themselves

only in so far as these are connected with the conception of the objects




in the above example we merely attempted to show the great difference which

exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphere of

conceptions and its intuitive exercise by means of the construction of

conceptions the question naturally arises what is the cause which

necessitates this twofold exercise of reason and how are we to discover

whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical method which reason is

pursuing in an argument




all our knowledge relates finally to possible intuitions for it is these

alone that present objects to the mind an  priori or nonempirical conception

contains either a pure intuitionand in this case it can be constructed

or it contains nothing but the synthesis of possible intuitions which are not

given  priori in this latter case it may help us to form synthetical 

priori judgements but only in the discursive method by conceptions not in

the intuitive by means of the construction of conceptions




the only  priori intuition is that of the pure form of phenomenaspace

and time a conception of space and time as quanta may be presented  priori in

intuition that is constructed either alone with their quality figure or

as pure quantity the mere synthesis of the homogeneous by means of number

but the matter of phenomena by which things are given in space and time can

be presented only in perception  posteriori the only conception which

represents  priori this empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a

thing in general and the  priori synthetical cognition of this conception can

give us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which may be

contained in the corresponding  posteriori perception it is utterly

inadequate to present an  priori intuition of the real object which must

necessarily be empirical




synthetical propositions which relate to things in general an  priori

intuition of which is impossible are transcendental for this reason

transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of the construction of

conceptions they are  priori and based entirely on conceptions themselves

they contain merely the rule by which we are to seek in the world of

perception or experience the synthetical unity of that which cannot be intuited

 priori but they are incompetent to present any of the conceptions which

appear in them in an  priori intuition these can be given only  posteriori

in experience which however is itself possible only through these

synthetical principles




if we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception we must go

beyond it to the intuition in which it is given if we keep to what is

contained in the conception the judgement is merely analyticalit is

merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in the conception but i can

pass from the conception to the pure or empirical intuition which corresponds

to it i can proceed to examine my conception in concreto and to cognize

either  priori or a posterio what i find in the object of the conception the

former priori cognitionis rationalmathematical cognition by

means of the construction of the conception the latter posteriori

cognitionis purely empirical cognition which does not possess the

attributes of necessity and universality thus i may analyse the conception i

have of gold but i gain no new information from this analysis i merely

enumerate the different properties which i had connected with the notion

indicated by the word my knowledge has gained in logical clearness and

arrangement but no addition has been made to it but if i take the matter

which is indicated by this name and submit it to the examination of my senses

i am enabled to form several syntheticalalthough still

empiricalpropositions the mathematical conception of a triangle i

should construct that is present  priori in intuition and in this way

attain to rationalsynthetical cognition but when the transcendental

conception of reality or substance or power is presented to my mind i find

that it does not relate to or indicate either an empirical or pure intuition

but that it indicates merely the synthesis of empirical intuitions which

cannot of course be given  priori the synthesis in such a conception cannot

proceed  prioriwithout the aid of experienceto the intuition

which corresponds to the conception and for this reason none of these

conceptions can produce a determinative synthetical proposition they can never

present more than a principle of the synthesis75 of possible

empirical intuitions a transcendental proposition is therefore a synthetical

cognition of reason by means of pure conceptions and the discursive method and

it renders possible all synthetical unity in empirical cognition though it

cannot present us with any intuition  priori



 75

in the case of the conception of cause i do really go beyond the empirical

conception of an eventbut not to the intuition which presents this

conception in concreto but only to the timeconditions which may be found in

experience to correspond to the conception my procedure is therefore

strictly according to conceptions i cannot in a case of this kind employ the

construction of conceptions because the conception is merely a rule for the

synthesis of perceptions which are not pure intuitions and which therefore

cannot be given  priori




there is thus a twofold exercise of reason both modes have the properties of

universality and an  priori origin in common but are in their procedure of

widely different character the reason of this is that in the world of

phenomena in which alone objects are presented to our minds there are two

main elementsthe form of intuition space and time which can be

cognized and determined completely  priori and the matter or

contentthat which is presented in space and time and which

consequently contains a somethingan existence corresponding to our

powers of sensation as regards the latter which can never be given in a

determinate mode except by experience there are no  priori notions which

relate to it except the undetermined conceptions of the synthesis of possible

sensations in so far as these belong in a possible experience to the unity

of consciousness as regards the former we can determine our conceptions 

priori in intuition inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects

of the conceptions in space and timethese objects being regarded simply

as quanta in the one case reason proceeds according to conceptions and can do

nothing more than subject phenomena to thesewhich can only be determined

empirically that is  posterioriin conformity however with those

conceptions as the rules of all empirical synthesis in the other case reason

proceeds by the construction of conceptions and as these conceptions relate

to an  priori intuition they may be given and determined in pure intuition 

priori and without the aid of empirical data the examination and

consideration of everything that exists in space or timewhether it is a

quantum or not in how far the particular something which fills space or time

is a primary substratum or a mere determination of some other existence

whether it relates to anything elseeither as cause or effect whether

its existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with and dependence upon

others the possibility of this existence its reality and necessity or

oppositesall these form part of the cognition of reason on the ground of

conceptions and this cognition is termed philosophical but to determine 

priori an intuition in space its figure to divide time into periods or

merely to cognize the quantity of an intuition in space and time and to

determine it by numberall this is an operation of reason by means of the

construction of conceptions and is called mathematical




the success which attends the efforts of reason in the sphere of mathematics

naturally fosters the expectation that the same good fortune will be its lot

if it applies the mathematical method in other regions of mental endeavour

besides that of quantities its success is thus great because it can support

all its conceptions by  priori intuitions and in this way make itself a

master as it were over nature while pure philosophy with its  priori

discursive conceptions bungles about in the world of nature and cannot

accredit or show any  priori evidence of the reality of these conceptions

masters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success of this

method indeed it is a common persuasion that it is capable of being applied

to any subject of human thought they have hardly ever reflected or

philosophized on their favourite sciencea task of great difficulty and

the specific difference between the two modes of employing the faculty of

reason has never entered their thoughts rules current in the field of common

experience and which common sense stamps everywhere with its approval are

regarded by them as axiomatic from what source the conceptions of space and

time with which as the only primitive quanta they have to deal enter their

minds is a question which they do not trouble themselves to answer and they

think it just as unnecessary to examine into the origin of the pure conceptions

of the understanding and the extent of their validity all they have to do with

them is to employ them in all this they are perfectly right if they do not

overstep the limits of the sphere of nature but they pass unconsciously from

the world of sense to the insecure ground of pure transcendental conceptions

instabilis tellus innabilis unda where they can neither stand nor swim and

where the tracks of their footsteps are obliterated by time while the march of

mathematics is pursued on a broad and magnificent highway which the latest

posterity shall frequent without fear of danger or impediment




as we have taken upon us the task of determining clearly and certainly the

limits of pure reason in the sphere of transcendentalism and as the efforts of

reason in this direction are persisted in even after the plainest and most

expressive warnings hope still beckoning us past the limits of experience into

the splendours of the intellectual worldit becomes necessary to cut away

the last anchor of this fallacious and fantastic hope we shall accordingly

show that the mathematical method is unattended in the sphere of philosophy by

the least advantageexcept perhaps that it more plainly exhibits its

own inadequacythat geometry and philosophy are two quite different

things although they go hand in hand in the field of natural science and

consequently that the procedure of the one can never be imitated by the other




the evidence of mathematics rests upon definitions axioms and demonstrations

i shall be satisfied with showing that none of these forms can be employed or

imitated in philosophy in the sense in which they are understood by

mathematicians and that the geometrician if he employs his method in

philosophy will succeed only in building cardcastles while the employment of

the philosophical method in mathematics can result in nothing but mere

verbiage the essential business of philosophy indeed is to mark out the

limits of the science and even the mathematician unless his talent is

naturally circumscribed and limited to this particular department of knowledge

cannot turn a deaf ear to the warnings of philosophy or set himself above its

direction




i of definitions a definition is as the term itself indicates the

representation upon primary grounds of the complete conception of a thing

within its own limits76 accordingly an empirical conception

cannot be defined it can only be explained for as there are in such a

conception only a certain number of marks or signs which denote a certain

class of sensuous objects we can never be sure that we do not cogitate under

the word which indicates the same object at one time a greater at another a

smaller number of signs thus one person may cogitate in his conception of

gold in addition to its properties of weight colour malleability that of

resisting rust while another person may be ignorant of this quality we employ

certain signs only so long as we require them for the sake of distinction new

observations abstract some and add new ones so that an empirical conception

never remains within permanent limits it is in fact useless to define a

conception of this kind if for example we are speaking of water and its

properties we do not stop at what we actually think by the word water but

proceed to observation and experiment and the word with the few signs

attached to it is more properly a designation than a conception of the thing

a definition in this case would evidently be nothing more than a determination

of the word in the second place no  priori conception such as those of

substance cause right fitness and so on can be defined for i can never be

sure that the clear representation of a given conception which is given in a

confused state has been fully developed until i know that the representation

is adequate with its object but inasmuch as the conception as it is

presented to the mind may contain a number of obscure representations which

we do not observe in our analysis although we employ them in our application

of the conception i can never be sure that my analysis is complete while

examples may make this probable although they can never demonstrate the fact

instead of the word definition i should rather employ the term

expositiona more modest expression which the critic may accept without

surrendering his doubts as to the completeness of the analysis of any such

conception as therefore neither empirical nor  priori conceptions are

capable of definition we have to see whether the only other kind of

conceptionsarbitrary conceptionscan be subjected to this mental

operation such a conception can always be defined for i must know thoroughly

what i wished to cogitate in it as it was i who created it and it was not

given to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or by experience at

the same time i cannot say that by such a definition i have defined a real

object if the conception is based upon empirical conditions if for example

i have a conception of a clock for a ship this arbitrary conception does not

assure me of the existence or even of the possibility of the object my

definition of such a conception would with more propriety be termed a

declaration of a project than a definition of an object there are no other

conceptions which can bear definition except those which contain an arbitrary

synthesis which can be constructed  priori consequently the science of

mathematics alone possesses definitions for the object here thought is

presented  priori in intuition and thus it can never contain more or less

than the conception because the conception of the object has been given by the

definitionand primarily that is without deriving the definition from

any other source philosophical definitions are therefore merely expositions

of given conceptions while mathematical definitions are constructions of

conceptions originally formed by the mind itself the former are produced by

analysis the completeness of which is never demonstratively certain the

latter by a synthesis in a mathematical definition the conception is formed

in a philosophical definition it is only explained from this it follows



 76

the definition must describe the conception completely that is omit none of

the marks or signs of which it composed within its own limits that is it

must be precise and enumerate no more signs than belong to the conception and

on primary grounds that is to say the limitations of the bounds of the

conception must not be deduced from other conceptions as in this case a proof

would be necessary and the socalled definition would be incapable of taking

its place at the head of all the judgements we have to form regarding an

object




a that we must not imitate in philosophy the mathematical usage of

commencing with definitionsexcept by way of hypothesis or experiment

for as all socalled philosophical definitions are merely analyses of given

conceptions these conceptions although only in a confused form must precede

the analysis and the incomplete exposition must precede the complete so that

we may be able to draw certain inferences from the characteristics which an

incomplete analysis has enabled us to discover before we attain to the

complete exposition or definition of the conception in one word a full and

clear definition ought in philosophy rather to form the conclusion than the

commencement of our labours77 in mathematics on the contrary we

cannot have a conception prior to the definition it is the definition which

gives us the conception and it must for this reason form the commencement of

every chain of mathematical reasoning



 77

philosophy abounds in faulty definitions especially such as contain some of

the elements requisite to form a complete definition if a conception could not

be employed in reasoning before it had been defined it would fare ill with all

philosophical thought but as incompletely defined conceptions may always be

employed without detriment to truth so far as our analysis of the elements

contained in them proceeds imperfect definitions that is propositions which

are properly not definitions but merely approximations thereto may be used

with great advantage in mathematics definition belongs ad esse in philosophy

ad melius esse it is a difficult task to construct a proper definition

jurists are still without a complete definition of the idea of right




b mathematical definitions cannot be erroneous for the conception is given

only in and through the definition and thus it contains only what has been

cogitated in the definition but although a definition cannot be incorrect as

regards its content an error may sometimes although seldom creep into the

form this error consists in a want of precision thus the common definition of

a circlethat it is a curved line every point in which is equally

distant from another point called the centreis faulty from the fact

that the determination indicated by the word curved is superfluous for there

ought to be a particular theorem which may be easily proved from the

definition to the effect that every line which has all its points at equal

distances from another point must be a curved linethat is that not

even the smallest part of it can be straight analytical definitions on the

other hand may be erroneous in many respects either by the introduction of

signs which do not actually exist in the conception or by wanting in that

completeness which forms the essential of a definition in the latter case the

definition is necessarily defective because we can never be fully certain of

the completeness of our analysis for these reasons the method of definition

employed in mathematics cannot be imitated in philosophy




2 of axioms these in so far as they are immediately certain are  priori

synthetical principles now one conception cannot be connected synthetically

and yet immediately with another because if we wish to proceed out of and

beyond a conception a third mediating cognition is necessary and as

philosophy is a cognition of reason by the aid of conceptions alone there is

to be found in it no principle which deserves to be called an axiom

mathematics on the other hand may possess axioms because it can always

connect the predicates of an object  priori and without any mediating term

by means of the construction of conceptions in intuition such is the case with

the proposition three points can always lie in a plane on the other hand no

synthetical principle which is based upon conceptions can ever be immediately

certain for example the proposition everything that happens has a cause

because i require a mediating term to connect the two conceptions of event and

causenamely the condition of timedetermination in an experience and i

cannot cognize any such principle immediately and from conceptions alone

discursive principles are accordingly very different from intuitive

principles or axioms the former always require deduction which in the case of

the latter may be altogether dispensed with axioms are for this reason

always selfevident while philosophical principles whatever may be the degree

of certainty they possess cannot lay any claim to such a distinction no

synthetical proposition of pure transcendental reason can be so evident as is

often rashly enough declared as the statement twice two are four it is true

that in the analytic i introduced into the list of principles of the pure

understanding certain axioms of intuition but the principle there discussed

was not itself an axiom but served merely to present the principle of the

possibility of axioms in general while it was really nothing more than a

principle based upon conceptions for it is one part of the duty of

transcendental philosophy to establish the possibility of mathematics itself

philosophy possesses then no axioms and has no right to impose its  priori

principles upon thought until it has established their authority and validity

by a thoroughgoing deduction




3 of demonstrations only an apodeictic proof based upon intuition can be

termed a demonstration experience teaches us what is but it cannot convince

us that it might not have been otherwise hence a proof upon empirical grounds

cannot be apodeictic  priori conceptions in discursive cognition can never

produce intuitive certainty or evidence however certain the judgement they

present may be mathematics alone therefore contains demonstrations because

it does not deduce its cognition from conceptions but from the construction of

conceptions that is from intuition which can be given  priori in accordance

with conceptions the method of algebra in equations from which the correct

answer is deduced by reduction is a kind of constructionnot

geometrical but by symbolsin which all conceptions especially those of

the relations of quantities are represented in intuition by signs and thus

the conclusions in that science are secured from errors by the fact that every

proof is submitted to ocular evidence philosophical cognition does not possess

this advantage it being required to consider the general always in abstracto

by means of conceptions while mathematics can always consider it in concreto

in an individual intuition and at the same time by means of  priori

representation whereby all errors are rendered manifest to the senses the

formerdiscursive proofsought to be termed acroamatic proofs

rather than demonstrations as only words are employed in them while

demonstrations proper as the term itself indicates always require a reference

to the intuition of the object




it follows from all these considerations that it is not consonant with the

nature of philosophy especially in the sphere of pure reason to employ the

dogmatical method and to adorn itself with the titles and insignia of

mathematical science it does not belong to that order and can only hope for a

fraternal union with that science its attempts at mathematical evidence are

vain pretensions which can only keep it back from its true aim which is to

detect the illusory procedure of reason when transgressing its proper limits

and by fully explaining and analysing our conceptions to conduct us from the

dim regions of speculation to the clear region of modest selfknowledge reason

must not therefore in its transcendental endeavours look forward with such

confidence as if the path it is pursuing led straight to its aim nor reckon

with such security upon its premisses as to consider it unnecessary to take a

step back or to keep a strict watch for errors which overlooked in the

principles may be detected in the arguments themselvesin which case it

may be requisite either to determine these principles with greater strictness

or to change them entirely




i divide all apodeictic propositions whether demonstrable or immediately

certain into dogmata and mathemata a direct synthetical proposition based on

conceptions is a dogma a proposition of the same kind based on the

construction of conceptions is a mathema analytical judgements do not teach

us any more about an object than what was contained in the conception we had of

it because they do not extend our cognition beyond our conception of an

object they merely elucidate the conception they cannot therefore be with

propriety termed dogmas of the two kinds of  priori synthetical propositions

above mentioned only those which are employed in philosophy can according to

the general mode of speech bear this name those of arithmetic or geometry

would not be rightly so denominated thus the customary mode of speaking

confirms the explanation given above and the conclusion arrived at that only

those judgements which are based upon conceptions not on the construction of

conceptions can be termed dogmatical




thus pure reason in the sphere of speculation does not contain a single

direct synthetical judgement based upon conceptions by means of ideas it is

as we have shown incapable of producing synthetical judgements which are

objectively valid by means of the conceptions of the understanding it

establishes certain indubitable principles not however directly on the basis

of conceptions but only indirectly by means of the relation of these

conceptions to something of a purely contingent nature namely possible

experience when experience is presupposed these principles are apodeictically

certain but in themselves and directly they cannot even be cognized 

priori thus the given conceptions of cause and event will not be sufficient

for the demonstration of the proposition every event has a cause for this

reason it is not a dogma although from another point of view that of

experience it is capable of being proved to demonstration the proper term for

such a proposition is principle and not theorem although it does require to

be proved because it possesses the remarkable peculiarity of being the

condition of the possibility of its own ground of proof that is experience

and of forming a necessary presupposition in all empirical observation




if then in the speculative sphere of pure reason no dogmata are to be found

all dogmatical methods whether borrowed from mathematics or invented by

philosophical thinkers are alike inappropriate and inefficient they only

serve to conceal errors and fallacies and to deceive philosophy whose duty it

is to see that reason pursues a safe and straight path a philosophical method

may however be systematical for our reason is subjectively considered

itself a system and in the sphere of mere conceptions a system of

investigation according to principles of unity the material being supplied by

experience alone but this is not the proper place for discussing the peculiar

method of transcendental philosophy as our present task is simply to examine

whether our faculties are capable of erecting an edifice on the basis of pure

reason and how far they may proceed with the materials at their command


section ii the discipline of pure reason in

polemics


reason must be subject in all its operations to criticism which must always

be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint otherwise its

interests are imperilled and its influence obnoxious to suspicion there is

nothing however useful however sacred it may be that can claim exemption

from the searching examination of this supreme tribunal which has no respect

of persons the very existence of reason depends upon this freedom for the

voice of reason is not that of a dictatorial and despotic power it is rather

like the vote of the citizens of a free state every member of which must have

the privilege of giving free expression to his doubts and possess even the

right of veto




but while reason can never decline to submit itself to the tribunal of

criticism it has not always cause to dread the judgement of this court pure

reason however when engaged in the sphere of dogmatism is not so thoroughly

conscious of a strict observance of its highest laws as to appear before a

higher judicial reason with perfect confidence on the contrary it must

renounce its magnificent dogmatical pretensions in philosophy




very different is the case when it has to defend itself not before a judge

but against an equal if dogmatical assertions are advanced on the negative

side in opposition to those made by reason on the positive side its

justification kat authrhopon is complete although the proof of its

propositions is kat aletheian unsatisfactory




by the polemic of pure reason i mean the defence of its propositions made by

reason in opposition to the dogmatical counterpropositions advanced by other

parties the question here is not whether its own statements may not also be

false it merely regards the fact that reason proves that the opposite cannot

be established with demonstrative certainty nor even asserted with a higher

degree of probability reason does not hold her possessions upon sufferance

for although she cannot show a perfectly satisfactory title to them no one

can prove that she is not the rightful possessor




it is a melancholy reflection that reason in its highest exercise falls into

an antithetic and that the supreme tribunal for the settlement of differences

should not be at union with itself it is true that we had to discuss the

question of an apparent antithetic but we found that it was based upon a

misconception in conformity with the common prejudice phenomena were regarded

as things in themselves and thus an absolute completeness in their synthesis

was required in the one mode or in the other it was shown to be impossible in

both a demand entirely out of place in regard to phenomena there was then

no real selfcontradiction of reason in the propositions the series of

phenomena given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning and this

series is absolutely and in itself without beginning the two propositions are

perfectly consistent with each other because phenomena as phenomena are in

themselves nothing and consequently the hypothesis that they are things in

themselves must lead to selfcontradictory inferences




but there are cases in which a similar misunderstanding cannot be provided

against and the dispute must remain unsettled take for example the theistic

proposition there is a supreme being and on the other hand the atheistic

counterstatement there exists no supreme being or in psychology everything

that thinks possesses the attribute of absolute and permanent unity which is

utterly different from the transitory unity of material phenomena and the

counterproposition the soul is not an immaterial unity and its nature is

transitory like that of phenomena the objects of these questions contain no

heterogeneous or contradictory elements for they relate to things in

themselves and not to phenomena there would arise indeed a real

contradiction if reason came forward with a statement on the negative side of

these questions alone as regards the criticism to which the grounds of proof

on the affirmative side must be subjected it may be freely admitted without

necessitating the surrender of the affirmative propositions which have at

least the interest of reason in their favouran advantage which the

opposite party cannot lay claim to




i cannot agree with the opinion of several admirable thinkerssulzer

among the restthat in spite of the weakness of the arguments hitherto

in use we may hope one day to see sufficient demonstrations of the two

cardinal propositions of pure reasonthe existence of a supreme being

and the immortality of the soul i am certain on the contrary that this will

never be the case for on what ground can reason base such synthetical

propositions which do not relate to the objects of experience and their

internal possibility but it is also demonstratively certain that no one will

ever be able to maintain the contrary with the least show of probability for

as he can attempt such a proof solely upon the basis of pure reason he is

bound to prove that a supreme being and a thinking subject in the character of

a pure intelligence are impossible but where will he find the knowledge which

can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to things which

transcend the region of experience we may therefore rest assured that the

opposite never will be demonstrated we need not then have recourse to

scholastic arguments we may always admit the truth of those propositions which

are consistent with the speculative interests of reason in the sphere of

experience and form moreover the only means of uniting the speculative with

the practical interest our opponent who must not be considered here as a

critic solely we can be ready to meet with a non liquet which cannot fail to

disconcert him while we cannot deny his right to a similar retort as we have

on our side the advantage of the support of the subjective maxim of reason and

can therefore look upon all his sophistical arguments with calm indifference




from this point of view there is properly no antithetic of pure reason for

the only arena for such a struggle would be upon the field of pure theology and

psychology but on this ground there can appear no combatant whom we need to

fear ridicule and boasting can be his only weapons and these may be laughed

at as mere childs play this consideration restores to reason her

courage for what source of confidence could be found if she whose vocation

it is to destroy error were at variance with herself and without any

reasonable hope of ever reaching a state of permanent repose




everything in nature is good for some purpose even poisons are serviceable

they destroy the evil effects of other poisons generated in our system and

must always find a place in every complete pharmacopoeia the objections raised

against the fallacies and sophistries of speculative reason are objections

given by the nature of this reason itself and must therefore have a

destination and purpose which can only be for the good of humanity for what

purpose has providence raised many objects in which we have the deepest

interest so far above us that we vainly try to cognize them with certainty

and our powers of mental vision are rather excited than satisfied by the

glimpses we may chance to seize it is very doubtful whether it is for our

benefit to advance bold affirmations regarding subjects involved in such

obscurity perhaps it would even be detrimental to our best interests but it

is undoubtedly always beneficial to leave the investigating as well as the

critical reason in perfect freedom and permit it to take charge of its own

interests which are advanced as much by its limitation as by its extension of

its views and which always suffer by the interference of foreign powers

forcing it against its natural tendencies to bend to certain preconceived

designs




allow your opponent to say what he thinks reasonable and combat him only with

the weapons of reason have no anxiety for the practical interests of

humanitythese are never imperilled in a purely speculative dispute such

a dispute serves merely to disclose the antinomy of reason which as it has

its source in the nature of reason ought to be thoroughly investigated reason

is benefited by the examination of a subject on both sides and its judgements

are corrected by being limited it is not the matter that may give occasion to

dispute but the manner for it is perfectly permissible to employ in the

presence of reason the language of a firmly rooted faith even after we have

been obliged to renounce all pretensions to knowledge




if we were to ask the dispassionate david humea philosopher endowed in

a degree that few are with a wellbalanced judgement what motive induced you

to spend so much labour and thought in undermining the consoling and beneficial

persuasion that reason is capable of assuring us of the existence and

presenting us with a determinate conception of a supreme beinghis

answer would be nothing but the desire of teaching reason to know its own

powers better and at the same time a dislike of the procedure by which that

faculty was compelled to support foregone conclusions and prevented from

confessing the internal weaknesses which it cannot but feel when it enters upon

a rigid selfexamination if on the other hand we were to ask

priestleya philosopher who had no taste for transcendental speculation

but was entirely devoted to the principles of empiricismwhat his motives

were for overturning those two main pillars of religionthe doctrines of

the freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul in his view the hope

of a future life is but the expectation of the miracle of

resurrectionthis philosopher himself a zealous and pious teacher of

religion could give no other answer than this i acted in the interest of

reason which always suffers when certain objects are explained and judged by

a reference to other supposed laws than those of material naturethe only

laws which we know in a determinate manner it would be unfair to decry the

latter philosopher who endeavoured to harmonize his paradoxical opinions with

the interests of religion and to undervalue an honest and reflecting man

because he finds himself at a loss the moment he has left the field of natural

science the same grace must be accorded to hume a man not less welldisposed

and quite as blameless in his moral character and who pushed his abstract

speculations to an extreme length because as he rightly believed the object

of them lies entirely beyond the bounds of natural science and within the

sphere of pure ideas




what is to be done to provide against the danger which seems in the present

case to menace the best interests of humanity the course to be pursued in

reference to this subject is a perfectly plain and natural one let each

thinker pursue his own path if he shows talent if he gives evidence of

profound thought in one word if he shows that he possesses the power of

reasoningreason is always the gainer if you have recourse to other

means if you attempt to coerce reason if you raise the cry of treason to

humanity if you excite the feelings of the crowd which can neither understand

nor sympathize with such subtle speculationsyou will only make

yourselves ridiculous for the question does not concern the advantage or

disadvantage which we are expected to reap from such inquiries the question is

merely how far reason can advance in the field of speculation apart from all

kinds of interest and whether we may depend upon the exertions of speculative

reason or must renounce all reliance on it instead of joining the combatants

it is your part to be a tranquil spectator of the strugglea laborious

struggle for the parties engaged but attended in its progress as well as in

its result with the most advantageous consequences for the interests of

thought and knowledge it is absurd to expect to be enlightened by reason and

at the same time to prescribe to her what side of the question she must adopt

moreover reason is sufficiently held in check by its own power the limits

imposed on it by its own nature are sufficient it is unnecessary for you to

place over it additional guards as if its power were dangerous to the

constitution of the intellectual state in the dialectic of reason there is no

victory gained which need in the least disturb your tranquility




the strife of dialectic is a necessity of reason and we cannot but wish that

it had been conducted long ere this with that perfect freedom which ought to be

its essential condition in this case we should have had at an earlier period

a matured and profound criticism which must have put an end to all dialectical

disputes by exposing the illusions and prejudices in which they originated




there is in human nature an unworthy propensitya propensity which like

everything that springs from nature must in its final purpose be conducive to

the good of humanityto conceal our real sentiments and to give

expression only to certain received opinions which are regarded as at once

safe and promotive of the common good it is true this tendency not only to

conceal our real sentiments but to profess those which may gain us favour in

the eyes of society has not only civilized but in a certain measure

moralized us as no one can break through the outward covering of

respectability honour and morality and thus the seeminglygood examples

which we see around us form an excellent school for moral improvement so long

as our belief in their genuineness remains unshaken but this disposition to

represent ourselves as better than we are and to utter opinions which are not

our own can be nothing more than a kind of provisionary arrangement of nature

to lead us from the rudeness of an uncivilized state and to teach us how to

assume at least the appearance and manner of the good we see but when true

principles have been developed and have obtained a sure foundation in our

habit of thought this conventionalism must be attacked with earnest vigour

otherwise it corrupts the heart and checks the growth of good dispositions

with the mischievous weed of fair appearances




i am sorry to remark the same tendency to misrepresentation and hypocrisy in

the sphere of speculative discussion where there is less temptation to

restrain the free expression of thought for what can be more prejudicial to

the interests of intelligence than to falsify our real sentiments to conceal

the doubts which we feel in regard to our statements or to maintain the

validity of grounds of proof which we well know to be insufficient so long as

mere personal vanity is the source of these unworthy artificesand this

is generally the case in speculative discussions which are mostly destitute of

practical interest and are incapable of complete demonstrationthe

vanity of the opposite party exaggerates as much on the other side and thus

the result is the same although it is not brought about so soon as if the

dispute had been conducted in a sincere and upright spirit but where the mass

entertains the notion that the aim of certain subtle speculators is nothing

less than to shake the very foundations of public welfare and moralityit

seems not only prudent but even praise worthy to maintain the good cause by

illusory arguments rather than to give to our supposed opponents the advantage

of lowering our declarations to the moderate tone of a merely practical

conviction and of compelling us to confess our inability to attain to

apodeictic certainty in speculative subjects but we ought to reflect that

there is nothing in the world more fatal to the maintenance of a good cause

than deceit misrepresentation and falsehood that the strictest laws of

honesty should be observed in the discussion of a purely speculative subject is

the least requirement that can be made if we could reckon with security even

upon so little the conflict of speculative reason regarding the important

questions of god immortality and freedom would have been either decided long

ago or would very soon be brought to a conclusion but in general the

uprightness of the defence stands in an inverse ratio to the goodness of the

cause and perhaps more honesty and fairness are shown by those who deny than

by those who uphold these doctrines




i shall persuade myself then that i have readers who do not wish to see a

righteous cause defended by unfair arguments such will now recognize the fact

that according to the principles of this critique if we consider not what is

but what ought to be the case there can be really no polemic of pure reason

for how can two persons dispute about a thing the reality of which neither can

present in actual or even in possible experience each adopts the plan of

meditating on his idea for the purpose of drawing from the idea if he can

what is more than the idea that is the reality of the object which it

indicates how shall they settle the dispute since neither is able to make his

assertions directly comprehensible and certain but must restrict himself to

attacking and confuting those of his opponent all statements enounced by pure

reason transcend the conditions of possible experience beyond the sphere of

which we can discover no criterion of truth while they are at the same time

framed in accordance with the laws of the understanding which are applicable

only to experience and thus it is the fate of all such speculative discussions

that while the one party attacks the weaker side of his opponent he infallibly

lays open his own weaknesses




the critique of pure reason may be regarded as the highest tribunal for all

speculative disputes for it is not involved in these disputes which have an

immediate relation to certain objects and not to the laws of the mind but is

instituted for the purpose of determining the rights and limits of reason




without the control of criticism reason is as it were in a state of nature

and can only establish its claims and assertions by war criticism on the

contrary deciding all questions according to the fundamental laws of its own

institution secures to us the peace of law and order and enables us to

discuss all differences in the more tranquil manner of a legal process in the

former case disputes are ended by victory which both sides may claim and

which is followed by a hollow armistice in the latter by a sentence which

as it strikes at the root of all speculative differences ensures to all

concerned a lasting peace the endless disputes of a dogmatizing reason compel

us to look for some mode of arriving at a settled decision by a critical

investigation of reason itself just as hobbes maintains that the state of

nature is a state of injustice and violence and that we must leave it and

submit ourselves to the constraint of law which indeed limits individual

freedom but only that it may consist with the freedom of others and with the

common good of all




this freedom will among other things permit of our openly stating the

difficulties and doubts which we are ourselves unable to solve without being

decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens this privilege

forms part of the native rights of human reason which recognizes no other

judge than the universal reason of humanity and as this reason is the source

of all progress and improvement such a privilege is to be held sacred and

inviolable it is unwise moreover to denounce as dangerous any bold

assertions against or rash attacks upon an opinion which is held by the

largest and most moral class of the community for that would be giving them an

importance which they do not deserve when i hear that the freedom of the will

the hope of a future life and the existence of god have been overthrown by the

arguments of some able writer i feel a strong desire to read his book for i

expect that he will add to my knowledge and impart greater clearness and

distinctness to my views by the argumentative power shown in his writings but

i am perfectly certain even before i have opened the book that he has not

succeeded in a single point not because i believe i am in possession of

irrefutable demonstrations of these important propositions but because this

transcendental critique which has disclosed to me the power and the limits of

pure reason has fully convinced me that as it is insufficient to establish

the affirmative it is as powerless and even more so to assure us of the

truth of the negative answer to these questions from what source does this

freethinker derive his knowledge that there is for example no supreme being

this proposition lies out of the field of possible experience and therefore

beyond the limits of human cognition but i would not read at all the answer

which the dogmatical maintainer of the good cause makes to his opponent

because i know well beforehand that he will merely attack the fallacious

grounds of his adversary without being able to establish his own assertions

besides a new illusory argument in the construction of which talent and

acuteness are shown is suggestive of new ideas and new trains of reasoning

and in this respect the old and everyday sophistries are quite useless again

the dogmatical opponent of religion gives employment to criticism and enables

us to test and correct its principles while there is no occasion for anxiety

in regard to the influence and results of his reasoning




but it will be said must we not warn the youth entrusted to academical care

against such writings must we not preserve them from the knowledge of these

dangerous assertions until their judgement is ripened or rather until the

doctrines which we wish to inculcate are so firmly rooted in their minds as to

withstand all attempts at instilling the contrary dogmas from whatever quarter

they may come




if we are to confine ourselves to the dogmatical procedure in the sphere of

pure reason and find ourselves unable to settle such disputes otherwise than

by becoming a party in them and setting counterassertions against the

statements advanced by our opponents there is certainly no plan more advisable

for the moment but at the same time none more absurd and inefficient for the

future than this retaining of the youthful mind under guardianship for a time

and thus preserving itfor so long at leastfrom seduction into

error but when at a later period either curiosity or the prevalent fashion

of thought places such writings in their hands will the socalled convictions

of their youth stand firm the young thinker who has in his armoury none but

dogmatical weapons with which to resist the attacks of his opponent and who

cannot detect the latent dialectic which lies in his own opinions as well as in

those of the opposite party sees the advance of illusory arguments and grounds

of proof which have the advantage of novelty against as illusory grounds of

proof destitute of this advantage and which perhaps excite the suspicion

that the natural credulity of his youth has been abused by his instructors he

thinks he can find no better means of showing that he has out grown the

discipline of his minority than by despising those wellmeant warnings and

knowing no system of thought but that of dogmatism he drinks deep draughts of

the poison that is to sap the principles in which his early years were trained




exactly the opposite of the system here recommended ought to be pursued in

academical instruction this can only be effected however by a thorough

training in the critical investigation of pure reason for in order to bring

the principles of this critique into exercise as soon as possible and to

demonstrate their perfect even in the presence of the highest degree of

dialectical illusion the student ought to examine the assertions made on both

sides of speculative questions step by step and to test them by these

principles it cannot be a difficult task for him to show the fallacies

inherent in these propositions and thus he begins early to feel his own power

of securing himself against the influence of such sophistical arguments which

must finally lose for him all their illusory power and although the same

blows which overturn the edifice of his opponent are as fatal to his own

speculative structures if such he has wished to rear he need not feel any

sorrow in regard to this seeming misfortune as he has now before him a fair

prospect into the practical region in which he may reasonably hope to find a

more secure foundation for a rational system




there is accordingly no proper polemic in the sphere of pure reason both

parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows as they pass beyond the

limits of nature and can find no tangible point of attackno firm

footing for their dogmatical conflict fight as vigorously as they may the

shadows which they hew down immediately start up again like the heroes in

walhalla and renew the bloodless and unceasing contest




but neither can we admit that there is any proper sceptical employment of pure

reason such as might be based upon the principle of neutrality in all

speculative disputes to excite reason against itself to place weapons in the

hands of the party on the one side as well as in those of the other and to

remain an undisturbed and sarcastic spectator of the fierce struggle that

ensues seems from the dogmatical point of view to be a part fitting only a

malevolent disposition but when the sophist evidences an invincible obstinacy

and blindness and a pride which no criticism can moderate there is no other

practicable course than to oppose to this pride and obstinacy similar feelings

and pretensions on the other side equally well or ill founded so that reason

staggered by the reflections thus forced upon it finds it necessary to

moderate its confidence in such pretensions and to listen to the advice of

criticism but we cannot stop at these doubts much less regard the conviction

of our ignorance not only as a cure for the conceit natural to dogmatism but

as the settlement of the disputes in which reason is involved with itself on

the contrary scepticism is merely a means of awakening reason from its

dogmatic dreams and exciting it to a more careful investigation into its own

powers and pretensions but as scepticism appears to be the shortest road to a

permanent peace in the domain of philosophy and as it is the track pursued by

the many who aim at giving a philosophical colouring to their contemptuous

dislike of all inquiries of this kind i think it necessary to present to my

readers this mode of thought in its true light



scepticism not a permanent state for human reason



the consciousness of ignoranceunless this ignorance is recognized to be

absolutely necessary ought instead of forming the conclusion of my inquiries

to be the strongest motive to the pursuit of them all ignorance is either

ignorance of things or of the limits of knowledge if my ignorance is

accidental and not necessary it must incite me in the first case to a

dogmatical inquiry regarding the objects of which i am ignorant in the second

to a critical investigation into the bounds of all possible knowledge but that

my ignorance is absolutely necessary and unavoidable and that it consequently

absolves from the duty of all further investigation is a fact which cannot be

made out upon empirical groundsfrom observationbut upon critical

grounds alone that is by a thoroughgoing investigation into the primary

sources of cognition it follows that the determination of the bounds of reason

can be made only on  priori grounds while the empirical limitation of reason

which is merely an indeterminate cognition of an ignorance that can never be

completely removed can take place only  posteriori in other words our

empirical knowledge is limited by that which yet remains for us to know the

former cognition of our ignorance which is possible only on a rational basis

is a science the latter is merely a perception and we cannot say how far the

inferences drawn from it may extend if i regard the earth as it really

appears to my senses as a flat surface i am ignorant how far this surface

extends but experience teaches me that how far soever i go i always see

before me a space in which i can proceed farther and thus i know the

limitsmerely visualof my actual knowledge of the earth although

i am ignorant of the limits of the earth itself but if i have got so far as to

know that the earth is a sphere and that its surface is spherical i can

cognize  priori and determine upon principles from my knowledge of a small

part of this surfacesay to the extent of a degreethe diameter and

circumference of the earth and although i am ignorant of the objects which

this surface contains i have a perfect knowledge of its limits and extent




the sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to be a level

surface with an apparent horizonthat which forms the limit of its

extent and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditioned totality to

reach this limit by empirical means is impossible and all attempts to

determine it  priori according to a principle are alike in vain but all the

questions raised by pure reason relate to that which lies beyond this horizon

or at least in its boundary line




the celebrated david hume was one of those geographers of human reason who

believe that they have given a sufficient answer to all such questions by

declaring them to lie beyond the horizon of our knowledgea horizon

which however hume was unable to determine his attention especially was

directed to the principle of causality and he remarked with perfect justice

that the truth of this principle and even the objective validity of the

conception of a cause was not commonly based upon clear insight that is upon

 priori cognition hence he concluded that this law does not derive its

authority from its universality and necessity but merely from its general

applicability in the course of experience and a kind of subjective necessity

thence arising which he termed habit from the inability of reason to

establish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all

experience he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to pass the

region of the empirical




this procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination and if

necessary to disapproval may be termed the censura of reason this censura

must inevitably lead us to doubts regarding all transcendent employment of

principles but this is only the second step in our inquiry the first step in

regard to the subjects of pure reason and which marks the infancy of that

faculty is that of dogmatism the second which we have just mentioned is

that of scepticism and it gives evidence that our judgement has been improved

by experience but a third step is necessaryindicative of the maturity

and manhood of the judgement which now lays a firm foundation upon universal

and necessary principles this is the period of criticism in which we do not

examine the facta of reason but reason itself in the whole extent of its

powers and in regard to its capability of  priori cognition and thus we

determine not merely the empirical and evershifting bounds of our knowledge

but its necessary and eternal limits we demonstrate from indubitable

principles not merely our ignorance in respect to this or that subject but in

regard to all possible questions of a certain class thus scepticism is a

resting place for reason in which it may reflect on its dogmatical wanderings

and gain some knowledge of the region in which it happens to be that it may

pursue its way with greater certainty but it cannot be its permanent

dwellingplace it must take up its abode only in the region of complete

certitude whether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves or to

the limits which bound all our cognition




reason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plane of the bounds

of which we have only a general knowledge it ought rather to be compared to a

sphere the radius of which may be found from the curvature of its

surfacethat is the nature of  priori synthetical

propositionsand consequently its circumference and extent beyond the

sphere of experience there are no objects which it can cognize nay even

questions regarding such supposititious objects relate only to the subjective

principles of a complete determination of the relations which exist between the

understandingconceptions which lie within this sphere




we are actually in possession of  priori synthetical cognitions as is proved

by the existence of the principles of the understanding which anticipate

experience if any one cannot comprehend the possibility of these principles

he may have some reason to doubt whether they are really  priori but he

cannot on this account declare them to be impossible and affirm the nullity of

the steps which reason may have taken under their guidance he can only say if

we perceived their origin and their authenticity we should be able to

determine the extent and limits of reason but till we can do this all

propositions regarding the latter are mere random assertions in this view the

doubt respecting all dogmatical philosophy which proceeds without the guidance

of criticism is well grounded but we cannot therefore deny to reason the

ability to construct a sound philosophy when the way has been prepared by a

thorough critical investigation all the conceptions produced and all the

questions raised by pure reason do not lie in the sphere of experience but

in that of reason itself and hence they must be solved and shown to be either

valid or inadmissible by that faculty we have no right to decline the

solution of such problems on the ground that the solution can be discovered

only from the nature of things and under pretence of the limitation of human

faculties for reason is the sole creator of all these ideas and is therefore

bound either to establish their validity or to expose their illusory nature




the polemic of scepticism is properly directed against the dogmatist who

erects a system of philosophy without having examined the fundamental objective

principles on which it is based for the purpose of evidencing the futility of

his designs and thus bringing him to a knowledge of his own powers but in

itself scepticism does not give us any certain information in regard to the

bounds of our knowledge all unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are

facia which it is always useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic but

this cannot help us to any decision regarding the expectations which reason

cherishes of better success in future endeavours the investigations of

scepticism cannot therefore settle the dispute regarding the rights and

powers of human reason




hume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all sceptical philosophers

and his writings have undoubtedly exerted the most powerful influence in

awakening reason to a thorough investigation into its own powers it will

therefore well repay our labours to consider for a little the course of

reasoning which he followed and the errors into which he strayed although

setting out on the path of truth and certitude




hume was probably aware although he never clearly developed the notion that

we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond our conception of the

object i have termed this kind of judgement synthetical as regard the manner

in which i pass beyond my conception by the aid of experience no doubts can be

entertained experience is itself a synthesis of perceptions and it employs

perceptions to increment the conception which i obtain by means of another

perception but we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond a

conception and to extend our cognition  priori we attempt this in two

wayseither through the pure understanding in relation to that which

may become an object of experience or through pure reason in relation to

such properties of things or of the existence of things as can never be

presented in any experience this sceptical philosopher did not distinguish

these two kinds of judgements as he ought to have done but regarded this

augmentation of conceptions and if we may so express ourselves the

spontaneous generation of understanding and reason independently of the

impregnation of experience as altogether impossible the socalled  priori

principles of these faculties he consequently held to be invalid and imaginary

and regarded them as nothing but subjective habits of thought originating in

experience and therefore purely empirical and contingent rules to which we

attribute a spurious necessity and universality in support of this strange

assertion he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle of the

relation between cause and effect no faculty of the mind can conduct us from

the conception of a thing to the existence of something else and hence he

believed he could infer that without experience we possess no source from

which we can augment a conception and no ground sufficient to justify us in

framing a judgement that is to extend our cognition  priori that the light of

the sun which shines upon a piece of wax at the same time melts it while it

hardens clay no power of the understanding could infer from the conceptions

which we previously possessed of these substances much less is there any 

priori law that could conduct us to such a conclusion which experience alone

can certify on the other hand we have seen in our discussion of

transcendental logic that although we can never proceed immediately beyond

the content of the conception which is given us we can always cognize

completely  prioriin relation however to a third term namely

possible experiencethe law of its connection with other things for

example if i observe that a piece of wax melts i can cognize  priori that

there must have been something the suns heat preceding which this

law although without the aid of experience i could not cognize  priori and

in a determinate manner either the cause from the effect or the effect from

the cause hume was therefore wrong in inferring from the contingency of the

determination according to law the contingency of the law itself and the

passing beyond the conception of a thing to possible experience which is an 

priori proceeding constituting the objective reality of the conception he

confounded with our synthesis of objects in actual experience which is always

of course empirical thus too he regarded the principle of affinity which

has its seat in the understanding and indicates a necessary connection as a

mere rule of association lying in the imitative faculty of imagination which

can present only contingent and not objective connections




the sceptical errors of this remarkably acute thinker arose principally from a

defect which was common to him with the dogmatists namely that he had never

made a systematic review of all the different kinds of  priori synthesis

performed by the understanding had he done so he would have found to take

one example among many that the principle of permanence was of this character

and that it as well as the principle of causality anticipates experience in

this way he might have been able to describe the determinate limits of the 

priori operations of understanding and reason but he merely declared the

understanding to be limited instead of showing what its limits were he

created a general mistrust in the power of our faculties without giving us any

determinate knowledge of the bounds of our necessary and unavoidable ignorance

he examined and condemned some of the principles of the understanding without

investigating all its powers with the completeness necessary to criticism he

denies with truth certain powers to the understanding but he goes further

and declares it to be utterly inadequate to the  priori extension of

knowledge although he has not fully examined all the powers which reside in

the faculty and thus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too

that is to say his own declarations are doubted for his objections were based

upon facta which are contingent and not upon principles which can alone

demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmatical assertions




as hume makes no distinction between the wellgrounded claims of the

understanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason against which

however his attacks are mainly directed reason does not feel itself shut out

from all attempts at the extension of  priori cognition and hence it refuses

in spite of a few checks in this or that quarter to relinquish such efforts

for one naturally arms oneself to resist an attack and becomes more obstinate

in the resolve to establish the claims he has advanced but a complete review

of the powers of reason and the conviction thence arising that we are in

possession of a limited field of action while we must admit the vanity of

higher claims puts an end to all doubt and dispute and induces reason to rest

satisfied with the undisturbed possession of its limited domain




to the uncritical dogmatist who has not surveyed the sphere of his

understanding nor determined in accordance with principles the limits of

possible cognition who consequently is ignorant of his own powers and

believes he will discover them by the attempts he makes in the field of

cognition these attacks of scepticism are not only dangerous but destructive

for if there is one proposition in his chain of reasoning which he cannot

prove or the fallacy in which he cannot evolve in accordance with a principle

suspicion falls on all his statements however plausible they may appear




and thus scepticism the bane of dogmatical philosophy conducts us to a sound

investigation into the understanding and the reason when we are thus far

advanced we need fear no further attacks for the limits of our domain are

clearly marked out and we can make no claims nor become involved in any

disputes regarding the region that lies beyond these limits thus the sceptical

procedure in philosophy does not present any solution of the problems of

reason but it forms an excellent exercise for its powers awakening its

circumspection and indicating the means whereby it may most fully establish

its claims to its legitimate possessions


section iii the discipline of pure reason in

hypothesis


this critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts to extend the

bounds of knowledge by means of pure speculation are utterly fruitless so

much the wider field it may appear lies open to hypothesis as where we

cannot know with certainty we are at liberty to make guesses and to form

suppositions




imagination may be allowed under the strict surveillance of reason to invent

suppositions but these must be based on something that is perfectly

certainand that is the possibility of the object if we are well assured

upon this point it is allowable to have recourse to supposition in regard to

the reality of the object but this supposition must unless it is utterly

groundless be connected as its ground of explanation with that which is

really given and absolutely certain such a supposition is termed a hypothesis




it is beyond our power to form the least conception  priori of the possibility

of dynamical connection in phenomena and the category of the pure

understanding will not enable us to excogitate any such connection but merely

helps us to understand it when we meet with it in experience for this reason

we cannot in accordance with the categories imagine or invent any object or

any property of an object not given or that may not be given in experience

and employ it in a hypothesis otherwise we should be basing our chain of

reasoning upon mere chimerical fancies and not upon conceptions of things

thus we have no right to assume the existence of new powers not existing in

naturefor example an understanding with a nonsensuous intuition a

force of attraction without contact or some new kind of substances occupying

space and yet without the property of impenetrabilityand consequently

we cannot assume that there is any other kind of community among substances

than that observable in experience any kind of presence than that in space or

any kind of duration than that in time in one word the conditions of possible

experience are for reason the only conditions of the possibility of things

reason cannot venture to form independently of these conditions any

conceptions of things because such conceptions although not

selfcontradictory are without object and without application




the conceptions of reason are as we have already shown mere ideas and do not

relate to any object in any kind of experience at the same time they do not

indicate imaginary or possible objects they are purely problematical in their

nature and as aids to the heuristic exercise of the faculties form the basis

of the regulative principles for the systematic employment of the understanding

in the field of experience if we leave this ground of experience they become

mere fictions of thought the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable and

they cannot consequently be employed as hypotheses in the explanation of real

phenomena it is quite admissible to cogitate the soul as simple for the

purpose of enabling ourselves to employ the idea of a perfect and necessary

unity of all the faculties of the mind as the principle of all our inquiries

into its internal phenomena although we cannot cognize this unity in concreto

but to assume that the soul is a simple substance a transcendental conception

would be enouncing a proposition which is not only indemonstrableas many

physical hypotheses arebut a proposition which is purely arbitrary and

in the highest degree rash the simple is never presented in experience and

if by substance is here meant the permanent object of sensuous intuition the

possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly inconceivable reason affords

no good grounds for admitting the existence of intelligible beings or of

intelligible properties of sensuous things althoughas we have no

conception either of their possibility or of their impossibilityit will

always be out of our power to affirm dogmatically that they do not exist in

the explanation of given phenomena no other things and no other grounds of

explanation can be employed than those which stand in connection with the given

phenomena according to the known laws of experience a transcendental

hypothesis in which a mere idea of reason is employed to explain the phenomena

of nature would not give us any better insight into a phenomenon as we should

be trying to explain what we do not sufficiently understand from known

empirical principles by what we do not understand at all the principles of

such a hypothesis might conduce to the satisfaction of reason but it would not

assist the understanding in its application to objects order and conformity to

aims in the sphere of nature must be themselves explained upon natural grounds

and according to natural laws and the wildest hypotheses if they are only

physical are here more admissible than a hyperphysical hypothesis such as

that of a divine author for such a hypothesis would introduce the principle of

ignava ratio which requires us to give up the search for causes that might be

discovered in the course of experience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea

as regards the absolute totality of the grounds of explanation in the series of

these causes this can be no hindrance to the understanding in the case of

phenomena because as they are to us nothing more than phenomena we have no

right to look for anything like completeness in the synthesis of the series of

their conditions




transcendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible and we cannot use the

liberty of employing in the absence of physical hyperphysical grounds of

explanation and this for two reasons first because such hypothesis do not

advance reason but rather stop it in its progress secondly because this

licence would render fruitless all its exertions in its own proper sphere

which is that of experience for when the explanation of natural phenomena

happens to be difficult we have constantly at hand a transcendental ground of

explanation which lifts us above the necessity of investigating nature and

our inquiries are brought to a close not because we have obtained all the

requisite knowledge but because we abut upon a principle which is

incomprehensible and which indeed is so far back in the track of thought as

to contain the conception of the absolutely primal being




the next requisite for the admissibility of a hypothesis is its sufficiency

that is it must determine  priori the consequences which are given in

experience and which are supposed to follow from the hypothesis itself if we

require to employ auxiliary hypotheses the suspicion naturally arises that

they are mere fictions because the necessity for each of them requires the

same justification as in the case of the original hypothesis and thus their

testimony is invalid if we suppose the existence of an infinitely perfect

cause we possess sufficient grounds for the explanation of the conformity to

aims the order and the greatness which we observe in the universe but we find

ourselves obliged when we observe the evil in the world and the exceptions to

these laws to employ new hypothesis in support of the original one we employ

the idea of the simple nature of the human soul as the foundation of all the

theories we may form of its phenomena but when we meet with difficulties in

our way when we observe in the soul phenomena similar to the changes which

take place in matter we require to call in new auxiliary hypotheses these

may indeed not be false but we do not know them to be true because the only

witness to their certitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been

called in to explain




we are not discussing the abovementioned assertions regarding the immaterial

unity of the soul and the existence of a supreme being as dogmata which

certain philosophers profess to demonstrate  priori but purely as hypotheses

in the former case the dogmatist must take care that his arguments possess the

apodeictic certainty of a demonstration for the assertion that the reality of

such ideas is probable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a

proposition in geometry pure abstract reason apart from all experience can

either cognize nothing at all and hence the judgements it enounces are never

mere opinions they are either apodeictic certainties or declarations that

nothing can be known on the subject opinions and probable judgements on the

nature of things can only be employed to explain given phenomena or they may

relate to the effect in accordance with empirical laws of an actually

existing cause in other words we must restrict the sphere of opinion to the

world of experience and nature beyond this region opinion is mere invention

unless we are groping about for the truth on a path not yet fully known and

have some hopes of stumbling upon it by chance




but although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questions of pure

speculative reason they may be employed in the defence of these answers that

is to say hypotheses are admissible in polemic but not in the sphere of

dogmatism by the defence of statements of this character i do not mean an

attempt at discovering new grounds for their support but merely the refutation

of the arguments of opponents all  priori synthetical propositions possess

the peculiarity that although the philosopher who maintains the reality of the

ideas contained in the proposition is not in possession of sufficient knowledge

to establish the certainty of his statements his opponent is as little able to

prove the truth of the opposite this equality of fortune does not allow the

one party to be superior to the other in the sphere of speculative cognition

and it is this sphere accordingly that is the proper arena of these endless

speculative conflicts but we shall afterwards show that in relation to its

practical exercise reason has the right of admitting what in the field of

pure speculation she would not be justified in supposing except upon

perfectly sufficient grounds because all such suppositions destroy the

necessary completeness of speculationa condition which the practical

reason however does not consider to be requisite in this sphere therefore

reason is mistress of a possession her title to which she does not require to

provewhich in fact she could not do the burden of proof accordingly

rests upon the opponent but as he has just as little knowledge regarding the

subject discussed and is as little able to prove the nonexistence of the

object of an idea as the philosopher on the other side is to demonstrate its

reality it is evident that there is an advantage on the side of the

philosopher who maintains his proposition as a practically necessary

supposition melior est conditio possidentis for he is at liberty to employ

in selfdefence the same weapons as his opponent makes use of in attacking

him that is he has a right to use hypotheses not for the purpose of

supporting the arguments in favour of his own propositions but to show that

his opponent knows no more than himself regarding the subject under discussion

and cannot boast of any speculative advantage




hypotheses are therefore admissible in the sphere of pure reason only as

weapons for selfdefence and not as supports to dogmatical assertions but the

opposing party we must always seek for in ourselves for speculative reason is

in the sphere of transcendentalism dialectical in its own nature the

difficulties and objections we have to fear lie in ourselves they are like old

but never superannuated claims and we must seek them out and settle them once

and for ever if we are to expect a permanent peace external tranquility is

hollow and unreal the root of these contradictions which lies in the nature

of human reason must be destroyed and this can only be done by giving it in

the first instance freedom to grow nay by nourishing it that it may send

out shoots and thus betray its own existence it is our duty therefore to

try to discover new objections to put weapons in the bands of our opponent

and to grant him the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish we

have nothing to fear from these concessions on the contrary we may rather

hope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which no one will

ever venture to dispute




the thinker requires to be fully equipped the hypotheses of pure reason

which although but leaden weapons for they have not been steeled in the

armoury of experience are as useful as any that can be employed by his

opponents if accordingly we have assumed from a nonspeculative point of

view the immaterial nature of the soul and are met by the objection that

experience seems to prove that the growth and decay of our mental faculties are

mere modifications of the sensuous organismwe can weaken the force of

this objection by the assumption that the body is nothing but the fundamental

phenomenon to which as a necessary condition all sensibility and

consequently all thought relates in the present state of our existence and

that the separation of soul and body forms the conclusion of the sensuous

exercise of our power of cognition and the beginning of the intellectual the

body would in this view of the question be regarded not as the cause of

thought but merely as its restrictive condition as promotive of the sensuous

and animal but as a hindrance to the pure and spiritual life and the

dependence of the animal life on the constitution of the body would not prove

that the whole life of man was also dependent on the state of the organism we

might go still farther and discover new objections or carry out to their

extreme consequences those which have already been adduced




generation in the human race as well as among the irrational animals depends

on so many accidentsof occasion of proper sustenance of the laws

enacted by the government of a country of vice even that it is difficult to

believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life has begun under

circumstances so mean and trivial and so entirely dependent upon our own

control as regards the continuance of the existence of the whole race we need

have no difficulties for accident in single cases is subject to general laws

but in the case of each individual it would seem as if we could hardly expect

so wonderful an effect from causes so insignificant but in answer to these

objections we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all life is

properly intelligible and not subject to changes of time and that it neither

began in birth nor will end in death we may assume that this life is nothing

more than a sensuous representation of pure spiritual life that the whole

world of sense is but an image hovering before the faculty of cognition which

we exercise in this sphere and with no more objective reality than a dream

and that if we could intuite ourselves and other things as they really are we

should see ourselves in a world of spiritual natures our connection with which

did not begin at our birth and will not cease with the destruction of the body

and so on




we cannot be said to know what has been above asserted nor do we seriously

maintain the truth of these assertions and the notions therein indicated are

not even ideas of reason they are purely fictitious conceptions but this

hypothetical procedure is in perfect conformity with the laws of reason our

opponent mistakes the absence of empirical conditions for a proof of the

complete impossibility of all that we have asserted and we have to show him

that he has not exhausted the whole sphere of possibility and that he can as

little compass that sphere by the laws of experience and nature as we can lay

a secure foundation for the operations of reason beyond the region of

experience such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of an opponent

must not be regarded as declarations of opinion the philosopher abandons them

so soon as the opposite party renounces its dogmatical conceit to maintain a

simply negative position in relation to propositions which rest on an insecure

foundation well befits the moderation of a true philosopher but to uphold the

objections urged against an opponent as proofs of the opposite statement is a

proceeding just as unwarrantable and arrogant as it is to attack the position

of a philosopher who advances affirmative propositions regarding such a

subject




it is evident therefore that hypotheses in the speculative sphere are

valid not as independent propositions but only relatively to opposite

transcendent assumptions for to make the principles of possible experience

conditions of the possibility of things in general is just as transcendent a

procedure as to maintain the objective reality of ideas which can be applied to

no objects except such as lie without the limits of possible experience the

judgements enounced by pure reason must be necessary or they must not be

enounced at all reason cannot trouble herself with opinions but the

hypotheses we have been discussing are merely problematical judgements which

can neither be confuted nor proved while therefore they are not personal

opinions they are indispensable as answers to objections which are liable to

be raised but we must take care to confine them to this function and guard

against any assumption on their part of absolute validity a proceeding which

would involve reason in inextricable difficulties and contradictions


section iv the discipline of pure reason in relation

to proofs


it is a peculiarity which distinguishes the proofs of transcendental

synthetical propositions from those of all other  priori synthetical

cognitions that reason in the case of the former does not apply its

conceptions directly to an object but is first obliged to prove  priori the

objective validity of these conceptions and the possibility of their syntheses

this is not merely a prudential rule it is essential to the very possibility

of the proof of a transcendental proposition if i am required to pass 

priori beyond the conception of an object i find that it is utterly

impossible without the guidance of something which is not contained in the

conception in mathematics it is  priori intuition that guides my synthesis

and in this case all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure

intuition in transcendental cognition so long as we are dealing only with

conceptions of the understanding we are guided by possible experience that is

to say a proof in the sphere of transcendental cognition does not show that

the given conception that of an event for example leads directly to another

conception that of a causefor this would be a saltus which nothing can

justify but it shows that experience itself and consequently the object of

experience is impossible without the connection indicated by these

conceptions it follows that such a proof must demonstrate the possibility of

arriving synthetically and  priori at a certain knowledge of things which

was not contained in our conceptions of these things unless we pay particular

attention to this requirement our proofs instead of pursuing the straight

path indicated by reason follow the tortuous road of mere subjective

association the illusory conviction which rests upon subjective causes of

association and which is considered as resulting from the perception of a real

and objective natural affinity is always open to doubt and suspicion for this

reason all the attempts which have been made to prove the principle of

sufficient reason have according to the universal admission of philosophers

been quite unsuccessful and before the appearance of transcendental

criticism it was considered better as this principle could not be abandoned

to appeal boldly to the common sense of mankind a proceeding which always

proves that the problem which reason ought to solve is one in which

philosophers find great difficulties rather than attempt to discover new

dogmatical proofs




but if the proposition to be proved is a proposition of pure reason and if i

aim at passing beyond my empirical conceptions by the aid of mere ideas it is

necessary that the proof should first show that such a step in synthesis is

possible which it is not before it proceeds to prove the truth of the

proposition itself the socalled proof of the simple nature of the soul from

the unity of apperception is a very plausible one but it contains no answer

to the objection that as the notion of absolute simplicity is not a

conception which is directly applicable to a perception but is an idea which

must be inferredif at allfrom observation it is by no means

evident how the mere fact of consciousness which is contained in all thought

although in so far a simple representation can conduct me to the consciousness

and cognition of a thing which is purely a thinking substance when i represent

to my mind the power of my body as in motion my body in this thought is so far

absolute unity and my representation of it is a simple one and hence i can

indicate this representation by the motion of a point because i have made

abstraction of the size or volume of the body but i cannot hence infer that

given merely the moving power of a body the body may be cogitated as simple

substance merely because the representation in my mind takes no account of its

content in space and is consequently simple the simple in abstraction is

very different from the objectively simple and hence the ego which is simple

in the first sense may in the second sense as indicating the soul itself be

a very complex conception with a very various content thus it is evident that

in all such arguments there lurks a paralogism we guess for without some such

surmise our suspicion would not be excited in reference to a proof of this

character at the presence of the paralogism by keeping ever before us a

criterion of the possibility of those synthetical propositions which aim at

proving more than experience can teach us this criterion is obtained from the

observation that such proofs do not lead us directly from the subject of the

proposition to be proved to the required predicate but find it necessary to

presuppose the possibility of extending our cognition  priori by means of

ideas we must accordingly always use the greatest caution we require

before attempting any proof to consider how it is possible to extend the

sphere of cognition by the operations of pure reason and from what source we

are to derive knowledge which is not obtained from the analysis of

conceptions nor relates by anticipation to possible experience we shall

thus spare ourselves much severe and fruitless labour by not expecting from

reason what is beyond its power or rather by subjecting it to discipline and

teaching it to moderate its vehement desires for the extension of the sphere of

cognition




the first rule for our guidance is therefore not to attempt a transcendental

proof before we have considered from what source we are to derive the

principles upon which the proof is to be based and what right we have to

expect that our conclusions from these principles will be veracious if they

are principles of the understanding it is vain to expect that we should attain

by their means to ideas of pure reason for these principles are valid only in

regard to objects of possible experience if they are principles of pure

reason our labour is alike in vain for the principles of reason if employed

as objective are without exception dialectical and possess no validity or

truth except as regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason

in experience but when such delusive proof are presented to us it is our duty

to meet them with the non liquet of a matured judgement and although we are

unable to expose the particular sophism upon which the proof is based we have

a right to demand a deduction of the principles employed in it and if these

principles have their origin in pure reason alone such a deduction is

absolutely impossible and thus it is unnecessary that we should trouble

ourselves with the exposure and confutation of every sophistical illusion we

may at once bring all dialectic which is inexhaustible in the production of

fallacies before the bar of critical reason which tests the principles upon

which all dialectical procedure is based the second peculiarity of

transcendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot rest upon more

than a single proof if i am drawing conclusions not from conceptions but

from intuition corresponding to a conception be it pure intuition as in

mathematics or empirical as in natural science the intuition which forms the

basis of my inferences presents me with materials for many synthetical

propositions which i can connect in various modes while as it is allowable

to proceed from different points in the intention i can arrive by different

paths at the same proposition




but every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception and posits the

synthetical condition of the possibility of an object according to this

conception there must therefore be but one ground of proof because it is

the conception alone which determines the object and thus the proof cannot

contain anything more than the determination of the object according to the

conception in our transcendental analytic for example we inferred the

principle every event has a cause from the only condition of the objective

possibility of our conception of an event this is that an event cannot be

determined in time and consequently cannot form a part of experience unless

it stands under this dynamical law this is the only possible ground of proof

for our conception of an event possesses objective validity that is is a true

conception only because the law of causality determines an object to which it

can refer other arguments in support of this principle have been

attemptedsuch as that from the contingent nature of a phenomenon but

when this argument is considered we can discover no criterion of contingency

except the fact of an eventof something happening that is to say the

existence which is preceded by the nonexistence of an object and thus we fall

back on the very thing to be proved if the proposition every thinking

being is simple is to be proved we keep to the conception of the ego

which is simple and to which all thought has a relation the same is the case

with the transcendental proof of the existence of a deity which is based

solely upon the harmony and reciprocal fitness of the conceptions of an ens

realissimum and a necessary being and cannot be attempted in any other manner




this caution serves to simplify very much the criticism of all propositions of

reason when reason employs conceptions alone only one proof of its thesis is

possible if any when therefore the dogmatist advances with ten arguments in

favour of a proposition we may be sure that not one of them is conclusive for

if he possessed one which proved the proposition he brings forward to

demonstrationas must always be the case with the propositions of pure

reasonwhat need is there for any more his intention can only be similar

to that of the advocate who had different arguments for different judges this

availing himself of the weakness of those who examine his arguments who

without going into any profound investigation adopt the view of the case which

seems most probable at first sight and decide according to it




the third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of a proof is

that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic or indirect but always

ostensive or direct the direct or ostensive proof not only establishes the

truth of the proposition to be proved but exposes the grounds of its truth

the apagogic on the other hand may assure us of the truth of the proposition

but it cannot enable us to comprehend the grounds of its possibility the

latter is accordingly rather an auxiliary to an argument than a strictly

philosophical and rational mode of procedure in one respect however they

have an advantage over direct proofs from the fact that the mode of arguing by

contradiction which they employ renders our understanding of the question

more clear and approximates the proof to the certainty of an intuitional

demonstration




the true reason why indirect proofs are employed in different sciences is this

when the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition are too various or too

profound we try whether or not we may not discover the truth of our cognition

from its consequences the modus ponens of reasoning from the truth of its

inferences to the truth of a proposition would be admissible if all the

inferences that can be drawn from it are known to be true for in this case

there can be only one possible ground for these inferences and that is the

true one but this is a quite impracticable procedure as it surpasses all our

powers to discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from a

proposition but this mode of reasoning is employed under favour when we wish

to prove the truth of an hypothesis in which case we admit the truth of the

conclusionwhich is supported by analogythat if all the

inferences we have drawn and examined agree with the proposition assumed all

other possible inferences will also agree with it but in this way an

hypothesis can never be established as a demonstrated truth the modus tollens

of reasoning from known inferences to the unknown proposition is not only a

rigorous but a very easy mode of proof for if it can be shown that but one

inference from a proposition is false then the proposition must itself be

false instead then of examining in an ostensive argument the whole series

of the grounds on which the truth of a proposition rests we need only take the

opposite of this proposition and if one inference from it be false then must

the opposite be itself false and consequently the proposition which we

wished to prove must be true




the apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences where it is

impossible to mistake a subjective representation for an objective cognition

where this is possible it is plain that the opposite of a given proposition

may contradict merely the subjective conditions of thought and not the

objective cognition or it may happen that both propositions contradict each

other only under a subjective condition which is incorrectly considered to be

objective and as the condition is itself false both propositions may be

false and it will consequently be impossible to conclude the truth of the

one from the falseness of the other




in mathematics such subreptions are impossible and it is in this science

accordingly that the indirect mode of proof has its true place in the science

of nature where all assertion is based upon empirical intuition such

subreptions may be guarded against by the repeated comparison of observations

but this mode of proof is of little value in this sphere of knowledge but the

transcendental efforts of pure reason are all made in the sphere of the

subjective which is the real medium of all dialectical illusion and thus

reason endeavours in its premisses to impose upon us subjective

representations for objective cognitions in the transcendental sphere of pure

reason then and in the case of synthetical propositions it is inadmissible

to support a statement by disproving the counterstatement for only two cases

are possible either the counterstatement is nothing but the enouncement of

the inconsistency of the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions of

reason which does not affect the real case for example we cannot comprehend

the unconditioned necessity of the existence of a being and hence every

speculative proof of the existence of such a being must be opposed on

subjective grounds while the possibility of this being in itself cannot with

justice be denied or both propositions being dialectical in their nature

are based upon an impossible conception in this latter case the rule applies

non entis nulla sunt predicata that is to say what we affirm and what we

deny respecting such an object are equally untrue and the apagogic mode of

arriving at the truth is in this case impossible if for example we

presuppose that the world of sense is given in itself in its totality it is

false either that it is infinite or that it is finite and limited in space

both are false because the hypothesis is false for the notion of phenomena

as mere representations which are given in themselves as objects is

selfcontradictory and the infinitude of this imaginary whole would indeed

be unconditioned but would be inconsistent as everything in the phenomenal

world is conditioned with the unconditioned determination and finitude of

quantities which is presupposed in our conception




the apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions which have

always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmatical philosophy

it may be compared to a champion who maintains the honour and claims of the

party he has adopted by offering battle to all who doubt the validity of these

claims and the purity of that honour while nothing can be proved in this way

except the respective strength of the combatants and the advantage in this

respect is always on the side of the attacking party spectators observing

that each party is alternately conqueror and conquered are led to regard the

subject of dispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon but such an

opinion cannot be justified and it is sufficient to apply to these reasoners

the remark



non defensoribus istis

tempus eget



each must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deduction of the

grounds of proof employed in his argument and thus enable us to see in what

way the claims of reason may be supported if an opponent bases his assertions

upon subjective grounds he may be refuted with ease not however to the

advantage of the dogmatist who likewise depends upon subjective sources of

cognition and is in like manner driven into a corner by his opponent but if

parties employ the direct method of procedure they will soon discover the

difficulty nay the impossibility of proving their assertions and will be

forced to appeal to prescription and precedence or they will by the help of

criticism discover with ease the dogmatical illusions by which they had been

mocked and compel reason to renounce its exaggerated pretensions to

speculative insight and to confine itself within the limits of its proper

spherethat of practical principles


chapter ii the canon of pure reason


it is a humiliating consideration for human reason that it is incompetent to

discover truth by means of pure speculation but on the contrary stands in

need of discipline to check its deviations from the straight path and to expose

the illusions which it originates but on the other hand this consideration

ought to elevate and to give it confidence for this discipline is exercised by

itself alone and it is subject to the censure of no other power the bounds

moreover which it is forced to set to its speculative exercise form likewise

a check upon the fallacious pretensions of opponents and thus what remains of

its possessions after these exaggerated claims have been disallowed is secure

from attack or usurpation the greatest and perhaps the only use of all

philosophy of pure reason is accordingly of a purely negative character it

is not an organon for the extension but a discipline for the determination of

the limits of its exercise and without laying claim to the discovery of new

truth it has the modest merit of guarding against error




at the same time there must be some source of positive cognitions which belong

to the domain of pure reason and which become the causes of error only from our

mistaking their true character while they form the goal towards which reason

continually strives how else can we account for the inextinguishable desire in

the human mind to find a firm footing in some region beyond the limits of the

world of experience it hopes to attain to the possession of a knowledge in

which it has the deepest interest it enters upon the path of pure speculation

but in vain we have some reason however to expect that in the only other

way that lies open to itthe path of practical reasonit may meet

with better success




i understand by a canon a list of the  priori principles of the proper

employment of certain faculties of cognition thus general logic in its

analytical department is a formal canon for the faculties of understanding and

reason in the same way transcendental analytic was seen to be a canon of the

pure understanding for it alone is competent to enounce true  priori

synthetical cognitions but when no proper employment of a faculty of

cognition is possible no canon can exist but the synthetical cognition of

pure speculative reason is as has been shown completely impossible there

cannot therefore exist any canon for the speculative exercise of this

facultyfor its speculative exercise is entirely dialectical and

consequently transcendental logic in this respect is merely a discipline

and not a canon if then there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of

pure reasonin which case there must be a canon for this

facultythis canon will relate not to the speculative but to the

practical use of reason this canon we now proceed to investigate


section i of the ultimate end of the pure use of

reason


there exists in the faculty of reason a natural desire to venture beyond the

field of experience to attempt to reach the utmost bounds of all cognition by

the help of ideas alone and not to rest satisfied until it has fulfilled its

course and raised the sum of its cognitions into a selfsubsistent systematic

whole is the motive for this endeavour to be found in its speculative or in

its practical interests alone




setting aside at present the results of the labours of pure reason in its

speculative exercise i shall merely inquire regarding the problems the

solution of which forms its ultimate aim whether reached or not and in

relation to which all other aims are but partial and intermediate these

highest aims must from the nature of reason possess complete unity otherwise

the highest interest of humanity could not be successfully promoted




the transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things the freedom

of the will the immortality of the soul and the existence of god the

speculative interest which reason has in those questions is very small and

for its sake alone we should not undertake the labour of transcendental

investigationa labour full of toil and ceaseless struggle we should be

loth to undertake this labour because the discoveries we might make would not

be of the smallest use in the sphere of concrete or physical investigation we

may find out that the will is free but this knowledge only relates to the

intelligible cause of our volition as regards the phenomena or expressions of

this will that is our actions we are bound in obedience to an inviolable

maxim without which reason cannot be employed in the sphere of experience to

explain these in the same way as we explain all the other phenomena of nature

that is to say according to its unchangeable laws we may have discovered the

spirituality and immortality of the soul but we cannot employ this knowledge

to explain the phenomena of this life nor the peculiar nature of the future

because our conception of an incorporeal nature is purely negative and does not

add anything to our knowledge and the only inferences to be drawn from it are

purely fictitious if again we prove the existence of a supreme intelligence

we should be able from it to make the conformity to aims existing in the

arrangement of the world comprehensible but we should not be justified in

deducing from it any particular arrangement or disposition or inferring any

where it is not perceived for it is a necessary rule of the speculative use of

reason that we must not overlook natural causes or refuse to listen to the

teaching of experience for the sake of deducing what we know and perceive from

something that transcends all our knowledge in one word these three

propositions are for the speculative reason always transcendent and cannot

be employed as immanent principles in relation to the objects of experience

they are consequently of no use to us in this sphere being but the valueless

results of the severe but unprofitable efforts of reason




if then the actual cognition of these three cardinal propositions is

perfectly useless while reason uses her utmost endeavours to induce us to

admit them it is plain that their real value and importance relate to our

practical and not to our speculative interest




i term all that is possible through free will practical but if the conditions

of the exercise of free volition are empirical reason can have only a

regulative and not a constitutive influence upon it and is serviceable

merely for the introduction of unity into its empirical laws in the moral

philosophy of prudence for example the sole business of reason is to bring

about a union of all the ends which are aimed at by our inclinations into one

ultimate endthat of happinessand to show the agreement which

should exist among the means of attaining that end in this sphere

accordingly reason cannot present to us any other than pragmatical laws of

free action for our guidance towards the aims set up by the senses and is

incompetent to give us laws which are pure and determined completely  priori

on the other hand pure practical laws the ends of which have been given by

reason entirely  priori and which are not empirically conditioned but are

on the contrary absolutely imperative in their nature would be products of

pure reason such are the moral laws and these alone belong to the sphere of

the practical exercise of reason and admit of a canon




all the powers of reason in the sphere of what may be termed pure philosophy

are in fact directed to the three abovementioned problems alone these again

have a still higher endthe answer to the question what we ought to do

if the will is free if there is a god and a future world now as this problem

relates to our in reference to the highest aim of humanity it is evident that

the ultimate intention of nature in the constitution of our reason has been

directed to the moral alone




we must take care however in turning our attention to an object which is

foreign78 to the sphere of transcendental

philosophy not to injure the unity of our system by digressions nor on the

other hand to fail in clearness by saying too little on the new subject of

discussion i hope to avoid both extremes by keeping as close as possible to

the transcendental and excluding all psychological that is empirical

elements



 78

all practical conceptions relate to objects of pleasure and pain and

consequentlyin an indirect manner at leastto objects of feeling

but as feeling is not a faculty of representation but lies out of the sphere

of our powers of cognition the elements of our judgements in so far as they

relate to pleasure or pain that is the elements of our practical judgements

do not belong to transcendental philosophy which has to do with pure  priori

cognitions alone




i have to remark in the first place that at present i treat of the conception

of freedom in the practical sense only and set aside the corresponding

transcendental conception which cannot be employed as a ground of explanation

in the phenomenal world but is itself a problem for pure reason a will is

purely animal arbitrium brutum when it is determined by sensuous impulses or

instincts only that is when it is determined in a pathological manner a

will which can be determined independently of sensuous impulses consequently

by motives presented by reason alone is called a free will arbitrium

liberum and everything which is connected with this free will either as

principle or consequence is termed practical the existence of practical

freedom can be proved from experience alone for the human will is not

determined by that alone which immediately affects the senses on the contrary

we have the power by calling up the notion of what is useful or hurtful in a

more distant relation of overcoming the immediate impressions on our sensuous

faculty of desire but these considerations of what is desirable in relation to

our whole state that is is in the end good and useful are based entirely

upon reason this faculty accordingly enounces laws which are imperative or

objective laws of freedom and which tell us what ought to take place thus

distinguishing themselves from the laws of nature which relate to that which

does take place the laws of freedom or of free will are hence termed practical

laws




whether reason is not itself in the actual delivery of these laws determined

in its turn by other influences and whether the action which in relation to

sensuous impulses we call free may not in relation to higher and more remote

operative causes really form a part of naturethese are questions which

do not here concern us they are purely speculative questions and all we have

to do in the practical sphere is to inquire into the rule of conduct which

reason has to present experience demonstrates to us the existence of practical

freedom as one of the causes which exist in nature that is it shows the

causal power of reason in the determination of the will the idea of

transcendental freedom on the contrary requires that reasonin relation

to its causal power of commencing a series of phenomenashould be

independent of all sensuous determining causes and thus it seems to be in

opposition to the law of nature and to all possible experience it therefore

remains a problem for the human mind but this problem does not concern reason

in its practical use and we have therefore in a canon of pure reason to do

with only two questions which relate to the practical interest of pure reason

is there a god and is there a future life the question of transcendental

freedom is purely speculative and we may therefore set it entirely aside when

we come to treat of practical reason besides we have already discussed this

subject in the antinomy of pure reason


section ii of the ideal of the summum bonum as a

determining ground of the ultimate end of pure reason


reason conducted us in its speculative use through the field of experience

and as it can never find complete satisfaction in that sphere from thence to

speculative ideaswhich however in the end brought us back again to

experience and thus fulfilled the purpose of reason in a manner which though

useful was not at all in accordance with our expectations it now remains for

us to consider whether pure reason can be employed in a practical sphere and

whether it will here conduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of

pure reason as we have just stated them we shall thus ascertain whether from

the point of view of its practical interest reason may not be able to supply

us with that which on the speculative side it wholly denies us




the whole interest of reason speculative as well as practical is centred in

the three following questions




1 what can i know

2 what ought i to do

3 what may i hope



the first question is purely speculative we have as i flatter myself

exhausted all the replies of which it is susceptible and have at last found

the reply with which reason must content itself and with which it ought to be

content so long as it pays no regard to the practical but from the two great

ends to the attainment of which all these efforts of pure reason were in fact

directed we remain just as far removed as if we had consulted our ease and

declined the task at the outset so far then as knowledge is concerned thus

much at least is established that in regard to those two problems it lies

beyond our reach




the second question is purely practical as such it may indeed fall within the

province of pure reason but still it is not transcendental but moral and

consequently cannot in itself form the subject of our criticism




the third question if i act as i ought to do what may i then hopeis

at once practical and theoretical the practical forms a clue to the answer of

the theoretical andin its highest formspeculative question for

all hoping has happiness for its object and stands in precisely the same

relation to the practical and the law of morality as knowing to the theoretical

cognition of things and the law of nature the former arrives finally at the

conclusion that something is which determines the ultimate end because

something ought to take place the latter that something is which operates as

the highest cause because something does take place




happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires extensive in regard to their

multiplicity intensive in regard to their degree and protensive in regard

to their duration the practical law based on the motive of happiness i term a

pragmatical law or prudential rule but that law assuming such to exist

which has no other motive than the worthiness of being happy i term a moral or

ethical law the first tells us what we have to do if we wish to become

possessed of happiness the second dictates how we ought to act in order to

deserve happiness the first is based upon empirical principles for it is only

by experience that i can learn either what inclinations exist which desire

satisfaction or what are the natural means of satisfying them the second

takes no account of our desires or the means of satisfying them and regards

only the freedom of a rational being and the necessary conditions under which

alone this freedom can harmonize with the distribution of happiness according

to principles this second law may therefore rest upon mere ideas of pure

reason and may be cognized  priori




i assume that there are pure moral laws which determine entirely  priori

without regard to empirical motives that is to happiness the conduct of a

rational being or in other words to use which it makes of its freedom and

that these laws are absolutely imperative not merely hypothetically on the

supposition of other empirical ends and therefore in all respects necessary

i am warranted in assuming this not only by the arguments of the most

enlightened moralists but by the moral judgement of every man who will make

the attempt to form a distinct conception of such a law




pure reason then contains not indeed in its speculative but in its

practical or more strictly its moral use principles of the possibility of

experience of such actions namely as in accordance with ethical precepts

might be met with in the history of man for since reason commands that such

actions should take place it must be possible for them to take place and

hence a particular kind of systematic unitythe moralmust be

possible we have found it is true that the systematic unity of nature could

not be established according to speculative principles of reason because

while reason possesses a causal power in relation to freedom it has none in

relation to the whole sphere of nature and while moral principles of reason

can produce free actions they cannot produce natural laws it is then in its

practical but especially in its moral use that the principles of pure reason

possess objective reality




i call the world a moral world in so far as it may be in accordance with all

the ethical lawswhich by virtue of the freedom of reasonable beings it

can be and according to the necessary laws of morality it ought to be but

this world must be conceived only as an intelligible world inasmuch as

abstraction is therein made of all conditions ends and even of all

impediments to morality the weakness or pravity of human nature so far

then it is a mere ideathough still a practical ideawhich may

have and ought to have an influence on the world of sense so as to bring it

as far as possible into conformity with itself the idea of a moral world has

therefore objective reality not as referring to an object of intelligible

intuitionfor of such an object we can form no conception

whateverbut to the world of senseconceived however as an object

of pure reason in its practical useand to a corpus mysticum of rational

beings in it in so far as the liberum arbitrium of the individual is placed

under and by virtue of moral laws in complete systematic unity both with

itself and with the freedom of all others




that is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reason which

relate to its practical interest do that which will render thee worthy of

happiness the second question is this if i conduct myself so as not to be

unworthy of happiness may i hope thereby to obtain happiness in order to

arrive at the solution of this question we must inquire whether the principles

of pure reason which prescribe  priori the law necessarily also connect this

hope with it




i say then that just as the moral principles are necessary according to

reason in its practical use so it is equally necessary according to reason in

its theoretical use to assume that every one has ground to hope for happiness

in the measure in which he has made himself worthy of it in his conduct and

that therefore the system of morality is inseparably though only in the idea

of pure reason connected with that of happiness




now in an intelligible that is in the moral world in the conception of which

we make abstraction of all the impediments to morality sensuous desires such

a system of happiness connected with and proportioned to morality may be

conceived as necessary because freedom of volitionpartly incited and

partly restrained by moral lawswould be itself the cause of general

happiness and thus rational beings under the guidance of such principles

would be themselves the authors both of their own enduring welfare and that of

others but such a system of selfrewarding morality is only an idea the

carrying out of which depends upon the condition that every one acts as he

ought in other words that all actions of reasonable beings be such as they

would be if they sprung from a supreme will comprehending in or under itself

all particular wills but since the moral law is binding on each individual in

the use of his freedom of volition even if others should not act in conformity

with this law neither the nature of things nor the causality of actions and

their relation to morality determine how the consequences of these actions

will be related to happiness and the necessary connection of the hope of

happiness with the unceasing endeavour to become worthy of happiness cannot be

cognized by reason if we take nature alone for our guide this connection can

be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause of nature is a supreme

reason which governs according to moral laws




i term the idea of an intelligence in which the morally most perfect will

united with supreme blessedness is the cause of all happiness in the world so

far as happiness stands in strict relation to morality as the worthiness of

being happy the ideal of the supreme good it is only then in the ideal of

the supreme original good that pure reason can find the ground of the

practically necessary connection of both elements of the highest derivative

good and accordingly of an intelligible that is moral world now since we

are necessitated by reason to conceive ourselves as belonging to such a world

while the senses present to us nothing but a world of phenomena we must assume

the former as a consequence of our conduct in the world of sense since the

world of sense gives us no hint of it and therefore as future in relation to

us thus god and a future life are two hypotheses which according to the

principles of pure reason are inseparable from the obligation which this

reason imposes upon us




morality per se constitutes a system but we can form no system of happiness

except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion to morality but this

is only possible in the intelligible world under a wise author and ruler such

a ruler together with life in such a world which we must look upon as future

reason finds itself compelled to assume or it must regard the moral laws as

idle dreams since the necessary consequence which this same reason connects

with them must without this hypothesis fall to the ground hence also the

moral laws are universally regarded as commands which they could not be did

they not connect  priori adequate consequences with their dictates and thus

carry with them promises and threats but this again they could not do did

they not reside in a necessary being as the supreme good which alone can

render such a teleological unity possible




leibnitz termed the world when viewed in relation to the rational beings which

it contains and the moral relations in which they stand to each other under

the government of the supreme good the kingdom of grace and distinguished it

from the kingdom of nature in which these rational beings live under moral

laws indeed but expect no other consequences from their actions than such as

follow according to the course of nature in the world of sense to view

ourselves therefore as in the kingdom of grace in which all happiness awaits

us except in so far as we ourselves limit our participation in it by actions

which render us unworthy of happiness is a practically necessary idea of

reason




practical laws in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions that is

subjective principles are termed maxims the judgements of moral according to

in its purity and ultimate results are framed according ideas the observance

of its laws according to maxims




the whole course of our life must be subject to moral maxims but this is

impossible unless with the moral law which is a mere idea reason connects an

efficient cause which ordains to all conduct which is in conformity with the

moral law an issue either in this or in another life which is in exact

conformity with our highest aims thus without a god and without a world

invisible to us now but hoped for the glorious ideas of morality are indeed

objects of approbation and of admiration but cannot be the springs of purpose

and action for they do not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every

rational being and which are determined  priori by pure reason itself and

necessary




happiness alone is in the view of reason far from being the complete good

reason does not approve of it however much inclination may desire it except

as united with desert on the other hand morality alone and with it mere

desert is likewise far from being the complete good to make it complete he

who conducts himself in a manner not unworthy of happiness must be able to

hope for the possession of happiness even reason unbiased by private ends or

interested considerations cannot judge otherwise if it puts itself in the

place of a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others for

in the practical idea both points are essentially combined though in such a

way that participation in happiness is rendered possible by the moral

disposition as its condition and not conversely the moral disposition by the

prospect of happiness for a disposition which should require the prospect of

happiness as its necessary condition would not be moral and hence also would

not be worthy of complete happinessa happiness which in the view of

reason recognizes no limitation but such as arises from our own immoral

conduct




happiness therefore in exact proportion with the morality of rational beings

whereby they are made worthy of happiness constitutes alone the supreme good

of a world into which we absolutely must transport ourselves according to the

commands of pure but practical reason this world is it is true only an

intelligible world for of such a systematic unity of ends as it requires the

world of sense gives us no hint its reality can be based on nothing else but

the hypothesis of a supreme original good in it independent reason equipped

with all the sufficiency of a supreme cause founds maintains and fulfils the

universal order of things with the most perfect teleological harmony however

much this order may be hidden from us in the world of sense




this moral theology has the peculiar advantage in contrast with speculative

theology of leading inevitably to the conception of a sole perfect and

rational first cause whereof speculative theology does not give us any

indication on objective grounds far less any convincing evidence for we find

neither in transcendental nor in natural theology however far reason may lead

us in these any ground to warrant us in assuming the existence of one only

being which stands at the head of all natural causes and on which these are

entirely dependent on the other hand if we take our stand on moral unity as a

necessary law of the universe and from this point of view consider what is

necessary to give this law adequate efficiency and for us obligatory force

we must come to the conclusion that there is one only supreme will which

comprehends all these laws in itself for how under different wills should we

find complete unity of ends this will must be omnipotent that all nature and

its relation to morality in the world may be subject to it omniscient that it

may have knowledge of the most secret feelings and their moral worth

omnipresent that it may be at hand to supply every necessity to which the

highest weal of the world may give rise eternal that this harmony of nature

and liberty may never fail and so on




but this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligenceswhich

as mere nature is only a world of sense but as a system of freedom of

volition may be termed an intelligible that is moral world regnum

gratiaeleads inevitably also to the teleological unity of all things

which constitute this great whole according to universal natural

lawsjust as the unity of the former is according to universal and

necessary moral lawsand unites the practical with the speculative

reason the world must be represented as having originated from an idea if it

is to harmonize with that use of reason without which we cannot even consider

ourselves as worthy of reasonnamely the moral use which rests entirely

on the idea of the supreme good hence the investigation of nature receives a

teleological direction and becomes in its widest extension physicotheology

but this taking its rise in moral order as a unity founded on the essence of

freedom and not accidentally instituted by external commands establishes the

teleological view of nature on grounds which must be inseparably connected with

the internal possibility of things this gives rise to a transcendental

theology which takes the ideal of the highest ontological perfection as a

principle of systematic unity and this principle connects all things according

to universal and necessary natural laws because all things have their origin

in the absolute necessity of the one only primal being




what use can we make of our understanding even in respect of experience if we

do not propose ends to ourselves but the highest ends are those of morality

and it is only pure reason that can give us the knowledge of these though

supplied with these and putting ourselves under their guidance we can make no

teleological use of the knowledge of nature as regards cognition unless

nature itself has established teleological unity for without this unity we

should not even possess reason because we should have no school for reason

and no cultivation through objects which afford the materials for its

conceptions but teleological unity is a necessary unity and founded on the

essence of the individual will itself hence this will which is the condition

of the application of this unity in concreto must be so likewise in this way

the transcendental enlargement of our rational cognition would be not the

cause but merely the effect of the practical teleology which pure reason

imposes upon us




hence also we find in the history of human reason that before the moral

conceptions were sufficiently purified and determined and before men had

attained to a perception of the systematic unity of ends according to these

conceptions and from necessary principles the knowledge of nature and even a

considerable amount of intellectual culture in many other sciences could

produce only rude and vague conceptions of the deity sometimes even admitting

of an astonishing indifference with regard to this question altogether but the

more enlarged treatment of moral ideas which was rendered necessary by the

extreme pure moral law of our religion awakened the interest and thereby

quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object in this way

and without the help either of an extended acquaintance with nature or of a

reliable transcendental insight for these have been wanting in all ages a

conception of the divine being was arrived at which we now hold to be the

correct one not because speculative reason convinces us of its correctness

but because it accords with the moral principles of reason thus it is to pure

reason but only in its practical use that we must ascribe the merit of having

connected with our highest interest a cognition of which mere speculation was

able only to form a conjecture but the validity of which it was unable to

establishand of having thereby rendered it not indeed a demonstrated

dogma but a hypothesis absolutely necessary to the essential ends of reason




but if practical reason has reached this elevation and has attained to the

conception of a sole primal being as the supreme good it must not therefore

imagine that it has transcended the empirical conditions of its application

and risen to the immediate cognition of new objects it must not presume to

start from the conception which it has gained and to deduce from it the moral

laws themselves for it was these very laws the internal practical necessity

of which led us to the hypothesis of an independent cause or of a wise ruler

of the universe who should give them effect hence we are not entitled to

regard them as accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler

especially as we have no conception of such a will except as formed in

accordance with these laws so far then as practical reason has the right to

conduct us we shall not look upon actions as binding on us because they are

the commands of god but we shall regard them as divine commands because we

are internally bound by them we shall study freedom under the teleological

unity which accords with principles of reason we shall look upon ourselves as

acting in conformity with the divine will only in so far as we hold sacred the

moral law which reason teaches us from the nature of actions themselves and we

shall believe that we can obey that will only by promoting the weal of the

universe in ourselves and in others moral theology is therefore only of

immanent use it teaches us to fulfil our destiny here in the world by placing

ourselves in harmony with the general system of ends and warns us against the

fanaticism nay the crime of depriving reason of its legislative authority in

the moral conduct of life for the purpose of directly connecting this

authority with the idea of the supreme being for this would be not an

immanent but a transcendent use of moral theology and like the transcendent

use of mere speculation would inevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate

ends of reason


section iii of opinion knowledge and belief


the holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understanding which

may rest on objective grounds but requires also subjective causes in the

mind of the person judging if a judgement is valid for every rational being

then its ground is objectively sufficient and it is termed a conviction if

on the other hand it has its ground in the particular character of the

subject it is termed a persuasion




persuasion is a mere illusion the ground of the judgement which lies solely

in the subject being regarded as objective hence a judgement of this kind has

only private validityis only valid for the individual who judges and

the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot be communicated but truth

depends upon agreement with the object and consequently the judgements of all

understandings if true must be in agreement with each other consentientia

uni tertio consentiunt inter se conviction may therefore be distinguished

from an external point of view from persuasion by the possibility of

communicating it and by showing its validity for the reason of every man for

in this case the presumption at least arises that the agreement of all

judgements with each other in spite of the different characters of

individuals rests upon the common ground of the agreement of each with the

object and thus the correctness of the judgement is established




persuasion accordingly cannot be subjectively distinguished from conviction

that is so long as the subject views its judgement simply as a phenomenon of

its own mind but if we inquire whether the grounds of our judgement which are

valid for us produce the same effect on the reason of others as on our own we

have then the means though only subjective means not indeed of producing

conviction but of detecting the merely private validity of the judgement in

other words of discovering that there is in it the element of mere persuasion




if we can in addition to this develop the subjective causes of the judgement

which we have taken for its objective grounds and thus explain the deceptive

judgement as a phenomenon in our mind apart altogether from the objective

character of the object we can then expose the illusion and need be no longer

deceived by it although if its subjective cause lies in our nature we cannot

hope altogether to escape its influence




i can only maintain that is affirm as necessarily valid for every one that

which produces conviction persuasion i may keep for myself if it is agreeable

to me but i cannot and ought not to attempt to impose it as binding upon

others




holding for true or the subjective validity of a judgement in relation to

conviction which is at the same time objectively valid has the three

following degrees opinion belief and knowledge opinion is a consciously

insufficient judgement subjectively as well as objectively belief is

subjectively sufficient but is recognized as being objectively insufficient

knowledge is both subjectively and objectively sufficient subjective

sufficiency is termed conviction for myself objective sufficiency is termed

certainty for all i need not dwell longer on the explanation of such simple

conceptions




i must never venture to be of opinion without knowing something at least by

which my judgement in itself merely problematical is brought into connection

with the truthwhich connection although not perfect is still something

more than an arbitrary fiction moreover the law of such a connection must be

certain for if in relation to this law i have nothing more than opinion my

judgement is but a play of the imagination without the least relation to

truth in the judgements of pure reason opinion has no place for as they do

not rest on empirical grounds and as the sphere of pure reason is that of

necessary truth and  priori cognition the principle of connection in it

requires universality and necessity and consequently perfect

certaintyotherwise we should have no guide to the truth at all hence it

is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics we must know or abstain from

forming a judgement altogether the case is the same with the maxims of

morality for we must not hazard an action on the mere opinion that it is

allowed but we must know it to be so in the transcendental sphere of reason

on the other hand the term opinion is too weak while the word knowledge is

too strong from the merely speculative point of view therefore we cannot

form a judgement at all for the subjective grounds of a judgement such as

produce belief cannot be admitted in speculative inquiries inasmuch as they

cannot stand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicated

to others in equal measure




but it is only from the practical point of view that a theoretically

insufficient judgement can be termed belief now the practical reference is

either to skill or to morality to the former when the end proposed is

arbitrary and accidental to the latter when it is absolutely necessary




if we propose to ourselves any end whatever the conditions of its attainment

are hypothetically necessary the necessity is subjectively but still only

comparatively sufficient if i am acquainted with no other conditions under

which the end can be attained on the other hand it is sufficient absolutely

and for every one if i know for certain that no one can be acquainted with any

other conditions under which the attainment of the proposed end would be

possible in the former case my suppositionmy judgement with regard to

certain conditionsis a merely accidental belief in the latter it is a

necessary belief the physician must pursue some course in the case of a

patient who is in danger but is ignorant of the nature of the disease he

observes the symptoms and concludes according to the best of his judgement

that it is a case of phthisis his belief is even in his own judgement only

contingent another man might perhaps come nearer the truth such a belief

contingent indeed but still forming the ground of the actual use of means for

the attainment of certain ends i term pragmatical belief




the usual test whether that which any one maintains is merely his persuasion

or his subjective conviction at least that is his firm belief is a bet it

frequently happens that a man delivers his opinions with so much boldness and

assurance that he appears to be under no apprehension as to the possibility of

his being in error the offer of a bet startles him and makes him pause

sometimes it turns out that his persuasion may be valued at a ducat but not at

ten for he does not hesitate perhaps to venture a ducat but if it is

proposed to stake ten he immediately becomes aware of the possibility of his

being mistakena possibility which has hitherto escaped his observation

if we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the happiness of our whole

life on the truth of any proposition our judgement drops its air of triumph

we take the alarm and discover the actual strength of our belief thus

pragmatical belief has degrees varying in proportion to the interests at

stake




now in cases where we cannot enter upon any course of action in reference to

some object and where accordingly our judgement is purely theoretical we

can still represent to ourselves in thought the possibility of a course of

action for which we suppose that we have sufficient grounds if any means

existed of ascertaining the truth of the matter thus we find in purely

theoretical judgements an analogon of practical judgements to which the word

belief may properly be applied and which we may term doctrinal belief i

should not hesitate to stake my all on the truth of the propositionif

there were any possibility of bringing it to the test of experiencethat

at least some one of the planets which we see is inhabited hence i say that

i have not merely the opinion but the strong belief on the correctness of

which i would stake even many of the advantages of life that there are

inhabitants in other worlds




now we must admit that the doctrine of the existence of god belongs to

doctrinal belief for although in respect to the theoretical cognition of the

universe i do not require to form any theory which necessarily involves this

idea as the condition of my explanation of the phenomena which the universe

presents but on the contrary am rather bound so to use my reason as if

everything were mere nature still teleological unity is so important a

condition of the application of my reason to nature that it is impossible for

me to ignore itespecially since in addition to these considerations

abundant examples of it are supplied by experience but the sole condition so

far as my knowledge extends under which this unity can be my guide in the

investigation of nature is the assumption that a supreme intelligence has

ordered all things according to the wisest ends consequently the hypothesis

of a wise author of the universe is necessary for my guidance in the

investigation of natureis the condition under which alone i can fulfil

an end which is contingent indeed but by no means unimportant moreover since

the result of my attempts so frequently confirms the utility of this

assumption and since nothing decisive can be adduced against it it follows

that it would be saying far too little to term my judgement in this case a

mere opinion and that even in this theoretical connection i may assert that

i firmly believe in god still if we use words strictly this must not be

called a practical but a doctrinal belief which the theology of nature

physicotheology must also produce in my mind in the wisdom of a supreme

being and in the shortness of life so inadequate to the development of the

glorious powers of human nature we may find equally sufficient grounds for a

doctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul




the expression of belief is in such cases an expression of modesty from the

objective point of view but at the same time of firm confidence from the

subjective if i should venture to term this merely theoretical judgement even

so much as a hypothesis which i am entitled to assume a more complete

conception with regard to another world and to the cause of the world might

then be justly required of me than i am in reality able to give for if i

assume anything even as a mere hypothesis i must at least know so much of

the properties of such a being as will enable me not to form the conception

but to imagine the existence of it but the word belief refers only to the

guidance which an idea gives me and to its subjective influence on the conduct

of my reason which forces me to hold it fast though i may not be in a

position to give a speculative account of it




but mere doctrinal belief is to some extent wanting in stability we often

quit our hold of it in consequence of the difficulties which occur in

speculation though in the end we inevitably return to it again




it is quite otherwise with moral belief for in this sphere action is

absolutely necessary that is i must act in obedience to the moral law in all

points the end is here incontrovertibly established and there is only one

condition possible according to the best of my perception under which this

end can harmonize with all other ends and so have practical

validitynamely the existence of a god and of a future world i know

also to a certainty that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions

which conduct to the same unity of ends under the moral law but since the

moral precept is at the same time my maxim as reason requires that it should

be i am irresistibly constrained to believe in the existence of god and in a

future life and i am sure that nothing can make me waver in this belief since

i should thereby overthrow my moral maxims the renunciation of which would

render me hateful in my own eyes




thus while all the ambitious attempts of reason to penetrate beyond the limits

of experience end in disappointment there is still enough left to satisfy us

in a practical point of view no one it is true will be able to boast that he

knows that there is a god and a future life for if he knows this he is just

the man whom i have long wished to find all knowledge regarding an object of

mere reason can be communicated and i should thus be enabled to hope that my

own knowledge would receive this wonderful extension through the

instrumentality of his instruction no my conviction is not logical but moral

certainty and since it rests on subjective grounds of the moral sentiment i

must not even say it is morally certain that there is a god etc but i am

morally certain that is my belief in god and in another world is so

interwoven with my moral nature that i am under as little apprehension of

having the former torn from me as of losing the latter




the only point in this argument that may appear open to suspicion is that this

rational belief presupposes the existence of moral sentiments if we give up

this assumption and take a man who is entirely indifferent with regard to

moral laws the question which reason proposes becomes then merely a problem

for speculation and may indeed be supported by strong grounds from analogy

but not by such as will compel the most obstinate scepticism to give way79 but in these questions no man is free

from all interest for though the want of good sentiments may place him beyond

the influence of moral interests still even in this case enough may be left to

make him fear the existence of god and a future life for he cannot pretend to

any certainty of the nonexistence of god and of a future life

unlesssince it could only be proved by mere reason and therefore

apodeicticallyhe is prepared to establish the impossibility of both

which certainly no reasonable man would undertake to do this would be a

negative belief which could not indeed produce morality and good sentiments

but still could produce an analogon of these by operating as a powerful

restraint on the outbreak of evil dispositions



 79

the human mind as i believe every rational being must of necessity do takes

a natural interest in morality although this interest is not undivided and

may not be practically in preponderance if you strengthen and increase it you

will find the reason become docile more enlightened and more capable of

uniting the speculative interest with the practical but if you do not take

care at the outset or at least midway to make men good you will never force

them into an honest belief




but it will be said is this all that pure reason can effect in opening up

prospects beyond the limits of experience nothing more than two articles of

belief common sense could have done as much as this without taking the

philosophers to counsel in the matter




i shall not here eulogize philosophy for the benefits which the laborious

efforts of its criticism have conferred on human reasoneven granting

that its merit should turn out in the end to be only negativefor on this

point something more will be said in the next section but i ask do you

require that that knowledge which concerns all men should transcend the common

understanding and should only be revealed to you by philosophers the very

circumstance which has called forth your censure is the best confirmation of

the correctness of our previous assertions since it discloses what could not

have been foreseen that nature is not chargeable with any partial distribution

of her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinction and

that in respect to the essential ends of human nature we cannot advance

further with the help of the highest philosophy than under the guidance which

nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding


chapter iii the architectonic of pure reason


by the term architectonic i mean the art of constructing a system without

systematic unity our knowledge cannot become science it will be an aggregate

and not a system thus architectonic is the doctrine of the scientific in

cognition and therefore necessarily forms part of our methodology




reason cannot permit our knowledge to remain in an unconnected and rhapsodistic

state but requires that the sum of our cognitions should constitute a system

it is thus alone that they can advance the ends of reason by a system i mean

the unity of various cognitions under one idea this idea is the

conceptiongiven by reasonof the form of a whole in so far as the

conception determines  priori not only the limits of its content but the

place which each of its parts is to occupy the scientific idea contains

therefore the end and the form of the whole which is in accordance with that

end the unity of the end to which all the parts of the system relate and

through which all have a relation to each other communicates unity to the

whole system so that the absence of any part can be immediately detected from

our knowledge of the rest and it determines  priori the limits of the system

thus excluding all contingent or arbitrary additions the whole is thus an

organism articulatio and not an aggregate coacervatio it may grow from

within per intussusceptionem but it cannot increase by external additions

per appositionem it is thus like an animal body the growth of which does

not add any limb but without changing their proportions makes each in its

sphere stronger and more active




we require for the execution of the idea of a system a schema that is a

content and an arrangement of parts determined  priori by the principle which

the aim of the system prescribes a schema which is not projected in accordance

with an idea that is from the standpoint of the highest aim of reason but

merely empirically in accordance with accidental aims and purposes the number

of which cannot be predetermined can give us nothing more than technical

unity but the schema which is originated from an idea in which case reason

presents us with aims  priori and does not look for them to experience

forms the basis of architectonical unity a science in the proper acceptation

of that term cannot be formed technically that is from observation of the

similarity existing between different objects and the purely contingent use we

make of our knowledge in concreto with reference to all kinds of arbitrary

external aims its constitution must be framed on architectonical principles

that is its parts must be shown to possess an essential affinity and be

capable of being deduced from one supreme and internal aim or end which forms

the condition of the possibility of the scientific whole the schema of a

science must give  priori the plan of it monogramma and the division of the

whole into parts in conformity with the idea of the science and it must also

distinguish this whole from all others according to certain understood

principles




no one will attempt to construct a science unless he have some idea to rest on

as a proper basis but in the elaboration of the science he finds that the

schema nay even the definition which he at first gave of the science rarely

corresponds with his idea for this idea lies like a germ in our reason its

parts undeveloped and hid even from microscopical observation for this reason

we ought to explain and define sciences not according to the description which

the originator gives of them but according to the idea which we find based in

reason itself and which is suggested by the natural unity of the parts of the

science already accumulated for it will of ten be found that the originator of

a science and even his latest successors remain attached to an erroneous idea

which they cannot render clear to themselves and that they thus fail in

determining the true content the articulation or systematic unity and the

limits of their science




it is unfortunate that only after having occupied ourselves for a long time in

the collection of materials under the guidance of an idea which lies

undeveloped in the mind but not according to any definite plan of

arrangementnay only after we have spent much time and labour in the

technical disposition of our materials does it become possible to view the

idea of a science in a clear light and to project according to

architectonical principles a plan of the whole in accordance with the aims of

reason systems seem like certain worms to be formed by a kind of generatio

aequivocaby the mere confluence of conceptions and to gain completeness

only with the progress of time but the schema or germ of all lies in reason

and thus is not only every system organized according to its own idea but all

are united into one grand system of human knowledge of which they form

members for this reason it is possible to frame an architectonic of all human

cognition the formation of which at the present time considering the immense

materials collected or to be found in the ruins of old systems would not

indeed be very difficult our purpose at present is merely to sketch the plan

of the architectonic of all cognition given by pure reason and we begin from

the point where the main root of human knowledge divides into two one of which

is reason by reason i understand here the whole higher faculty of cognition

the rational being placed in contradistinction to the empirical




if i make complete abstraction of the content of cognition objectively

considered all cognition is from a subjective point of view either

historical or rational historical cognition is cognitio ex datis rational

cognitio ex principiis whatever may be the original source of a cognition it

is in relation to the person who possesses it merely historical if he knows

only what has been given him from another quarter whether that knowledge was

communicated by direct experience or by instruction thus the person who has

learned a system of philosophysay the wolfianalthough he has a

perfect knowledge of all the principles definitions and arguments in that

philosophy as well as of the divisions that have been made of the system

possesses really no more than an historical knowledge of the wolfian system he

knows only what has been told him his judgements are only those which he has

received from his teachers dispute the validity of a definition and he is

completely at a loss to find another he has formed his mind on

anothers but the imitative faculty is not the productive his knowledge

has not been drawn from reason and although objectively considered it is

rational knowledge subjectively it is merely historical he has learned this

or that philosophy and is merely a plaster cast of a living man rational

cognitions which are objective that is which have their source in reason can

be so termed from a subjective point of view only when they have been drawn by

the individual himself from the sources of reason that is from principles

and it is in this way alone that criticism or even the rejection of what has

been already learned can spring up in the mind




all rational cognition is again based either on conceptions or on the

construction of conceptions the former is termed philosophical the latter

mathematical i have already shown the essential difference of these two

methods of cognition in the first chapter a cognition may be objectively

philosophical and subjectively historicalas is the case with the

majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond the limits of their

system and who remain in a state of pupilage all their lives but it is

remarkable that mathematical knowledge when committed to memory is valid

from the subjective point of view as rational knowledge also and that the

same distinction cannot be drawn here as in the case of philosophical

cognition the reason is that the only way of arriving at this knowledge is

through the essential principles of reason and thus it is always certain and

indisputable because reason is employed in concretobut at the same time

 priorithat is in pure and therefore infallible intuition and thus

all causes of illusion and error are excluded of all the  priori sciences of

reason therefore mathematics alone can be learned philosophyunless it

be in an historical mannercannot be learned we can at most learn to

philosophize




philosophy is the system of all philosophical cognition we must use this term

in an objective sense if we understand by it the archetype of all attempts at

philosophizing and the standard by which all subjective philosophies are to be

judged in this sense philosophy is merely the idea of a possible science

which does not exist in concreto but to which we endeavour in various ways to

approximate until we have discovered the right path to pursuea path

overgrown by the errors and illusions of senseand the image we have

hitherto tried in vain to shape has become a perfect copy of the great

prototype until that time we cannot learn philosophyit does not exist

if it does where is it who possesses it and how shall we know it we can

only learn to philosophize in other words we can only exercise our powers of

reasoning in accordance with general principles retaining at the same time

the right of investigating the sources of these principles of testing and

even of rejecting them




until then our conception of philosophy is only a scholastic

conceptiona conception that is of a system of cognition which we are

trying to elaborate into a science all that we at present know being the

systematic unity of this cognition and consequently the logical completeness

of the cognition for the desired end but there is also a cosmical conception

conceptus cosmicus of philosophy which has always formed the true basis of

this term especially when philosophy was personified and presented to us in

the ideal of a philosopher in this view philosophy is the science of the

relation of all cognition to the ultimate and essential aims of human reason

teleologia rationis humanae and the philosopher is not merely an

artistwho occupies himself with conceptionsbut a lawgiver

legislating for human reason in this sense of the word it would be in the

highest degree arrogant to assume the title of philosopher and to pretend that

we had reached the perfection of the prototype which lies in the idea alone




the mathematician the natural philosopher and the logicianhow far

soever the first may have advanced in rational and the two latter in

philosophical knowledgeare merely artists engaged in the arrangement

and formation of conceptions they cannot be termed philosophers above them

all there is the ideal teacher who employs them as instruments for the

advancement of the essential aims of human reason him alone can we call

philosopher but he nowhere exists but the idea of his legislative power

resides in the mind of every man and it alone teaches us what kind of

systematic unity philosophy demands in view of the ultimate aims of reason

this idea is therefore a cosmical conception80


 80

by a cosmical conception i mean one in which all men necessarily take an

interest the aim of a science must accordingly be determined according to

scholastic conceptions if it is regarded merely as a means to certain

arbitrarily proposed ends




in view of the complete systematic unity of reason there can only be one

ultimate end of all the operations of the mind to this all other aims are

subordinate and nothing more than means for its attainment this ultimate end

is the destination of man and the philosophy which relates to it is termed

moral philosophy the superior position occupied by moral philosophy above all

other spheres for the operations of reason sufficiently indicates the reason

why the ancients always included the ideaand in an especial

mannerof moralist in that of philosopher even at the present day we

call a man who appears to have the power of selfgovernment even although his

knowledge may be very limited by the name of philosopher




the legislation of human reason or philosophy has two objectsnature

and freedomand thus contains not only the laws of nature but also those

of ethics at first in two separate systems which finally merge into one

grand philosophical system of cognition the philosophy of nature relates to

that which is that of ethics to that which ought to be




but all philosophy is either cognition on the basis of pure reason or the

cognition of reason on the basis of empirical principles the former is termed

pure the latter empirical philosophy




the philosophy of pure reason is either propdeutic that is an inquiry into

the powers of reason in regard to pure  priori cognition and is termed

critical philosophy or it is secondly the system of pure reasona

science containing the systematic presentation of the whole body of

philosophical knowledge true as well as illusory given by pure

reasonand is called metaphysic this name may however be also given to

the whole system of pure philosophy critical philosophy included and may

designate the investigation into the sources or possibility of  priori

cognition as well as the presentation of the  priori cognitions which form a

system of pure philosophyexcluding at the same time all empirical and

mathematical elements




metaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of the practical

use of pure reason and is accordingly either the metaphysic of nature or

the metaphysic of ethics the former contains all the pure rational

principlesbased upon conceptions alone and thus excluding

mathematicsof all theoretical cognition the latter the principles

which determine and necessitate  priori all action now moral philosophy alone

contains a code of lawsfor the regulation of our actionswhich are

deduced from principles entirely  priori hence the metaphysic of ethics is

the only pure moral philosophy as it is not based upon anthropological or

other empirical considerations the metaphysic of speculative reason is what is

commonly called metaphysic in the more limited sense but as pure moral

philosophy properly forms a part of this system of cognition we must allow it

to retain the name of metaphysic although it is not requisite that we should

insist on so terming it in our present discussion




it is of the highest importance to separate those cognitions which differ from

others both in kind and in origin and to take great care that they are not

confounded with those with which they are generally found connected what the

chemist does in the analysis of substances what the mathematician in pure

mathematics is in a still higher degree the duty of the philosopher that

the value of each different kind of cognition and the part it takes in the

operations of the mind may be clearly defined human reason has never wanted a

metaphysic of some kind since it attained the power of thought or rather of

reflection but it has never been able to keep this sphere of thought and

cognition pure from all admixture of foreign elements the idea of a science of

this kind is as old as speculation itself and what mind does not

speculateeither in the scholastic or in the popular fashion at the same

time it must be admitted that even thinkers by profession have been unable

clearly to explain the distinction between the two elements of our

cognitionthe one completely  priori the other  posteriori and hence

the proper definition of a peculiar kind of cognition and with it the just

idea of a science which has so long and so deeply engaged the attention of the

human mind has never been established when it was said metaphysic is

the science of the first principles of human cognition this definition

did not signalize a peculiarity in kind but only a difference in degree these

first principles were thus declared to be more general than others but no

criterion of distinction from empirical principles was given of these some are

more general and therefore higher than others andas we cannot

distinguish what is completely  priori from that which is known to be 

posterioriwhere shall we draw the line which is to separate the higher

and socalled first principles from the lower and subordinate principles of

cognition what would be said if we were asked to be satisfied with a division

of the epochs of the world into the earlier centuries and those following them

does the fifth or the tenth century belong to the earlier

centuries it would be asked in the same way i ask does the conception

of extension belong to metaphysics you answer yes well that

of body too yes and that of a fluid body you stop you are

unprepared to admit this for if you do everything will belong to metaphysics

from this it is evident that the mere degree of subordinationof the

particular to the generalcannot determine the limits of a science and

that in the present case we must expect to find a difference in the

conceptions of metaphysics both in kind and in origin the fundamental idea of

metaphysics was obscured on another side by the fact that this kind of  priori

cognition showed a certain similarity in character with the science of

mathematics both have the property in common of possessing an  priori origin

but in the one our knowledge is based upon conceptions in the other on the

construction of conceptions thus a decided dissimilarity between philosophical

and mathematical cognition comes outa dissimilarity which was always

felt but which could not be made distinct for want of an insight into the

criteria of the difference and thus it happened that as philosophers

themselves failed in the proper development of the idea of their science the

elaboration of the science could not proceed with a definite aim or under

trustworthy guidance thus too philosophers ignorant of the path they ought

to pursue and always disputing with each other regarding the discoveries which

each asserted he had made brought their science into disrepute with the rest

of the world and finally even among themselves




all pure  priori cognition forms therefore in view of the peculiar faculty

which originates it a peculiar and distinct unity and metaphysic is the term

applied to the philosophy which attempts to represent that cognition in this

systematic unity the speculative part of metaphysic which has especially

appropriated this appellationthat which we have called the metaphysic of

natureand which considers everything as it is not as it ought to be

by means of  priori conceptions is divided in the following manner




metaphysic in the more limited acceptation of the term consists of two

partstranscendental philosophy and the physiology of pure reason the

former presents the system of all the conceptions and principles belonging to

the understanding and the reason and which relate to objects in general but

not to any particular given objects ontologia the latter has nature for its

subjectmatter that is the sum of given objectswhether given to the

senses or if we will to some other kind of intuitionand is

accordingly physiology although only rationalis but the use of the faculty of

reason in this rational mode of regarding nature is either physical or

hyperphysical or more properly speaking immanent or transcendent the former

relates to nature in so far as our knowledge regarding it may be applied in

experience in concreto the latter to that connection of the objects of

experience which transcends all experience transcendent physiology has

again an internal and an external connection with its object both however

transcending possible experience the former is the physiology of nature as a

whole or transcendental cognition of the world the latter of the connection

of the whole of nature with a being above nature or transcendental cognition

of god




immanent physiology on the contrary considers nature as the sum of all

sensuous objects consequently as it is presented to usbut still

according to  priori conditions for it is under these alone that nature can

be presented to our minds at all the objects of immanent physiology are of two

kinds 1 those of the external senses or corporeal nature 2 the object of

the internal sense the soul or in accordance with our fundamental

conceptions of it thinking nature the metaphysics of corporeal nature is

called physics but as it must contain only the principles of an  priori

cognition of nature we must term it rational physics the metaphysics of

thinking nature is called psychology and for the same reason is to be regarded

as merely the rational cognition of the soul




thus the whole system of metaphysics consists of four principal parts 1

ontology 2 rational physiology 3 rational cosmology and 4 rational

theology the second partthat of the rational doctrine of

naturemay be subdivided into two physica rationalis81 and psychologia rationalis



 81

it must not be supposed that i mean by this appellation what is generally

called physica general is and which is rather mathematics than a philosophy of

nature for the metaphysic of nature is completely different from mathematics

nor is it so rich in results although it is of great importance as a critical

test of the application of pure understandingcognition to nature for

want of its guidance even mathematicians adopting certain common

notionswhich are in fact metaphysicalhave unconsciously crowded

their theories of nature with hypotheses the fallacy of which becomes evident

upon the application of the principles of this metaphysic without detriment

however to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of cognition




the fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason of necessity dictates this

division it is therefore architectonicalin accordance with the

highest aims of reason and not merely technical or according to certain

accidentallyobserved similarities existing between the different parts of the

whole science for this reason also is the division immutable and of

legislative authority but the reader may observe in it a few points to which

he ought to demur and which may weaken his conviction of its truth and

legitimacy




in the first place how can i desire an  priori cognition or metaphysic of

objects in so far as they are given  posteriori and how is it possible to

cognize the nature of things according to  priori principles and to attain to

a rational physiology the answer is this we take from experience nothing more

than is requisite to present us with an object in general of the external or

of the internal sense in the former case by the mere conception of matter

impenetrable and inanimate extension in the latter by the conception of a

thinking beinggiven in the internal empirical representation i think

as to the rest we must not employ in our metaphysic of these objects any

empirical principles which add to the content of our conceptions by means of

experience for the purpose of forming by their help any judgements respecting

these objects




secondly what place shall we assign to empirical psychology which has always

been considered a part of metaphysics and from which in our time such

important philosophical results have been expected after the hope of

constructing an  priori system of knowledge had been abandoned i answer it

must be placed by the side of empirical physics or physics proper that is

must be regarded as forming a part of applied philosophy the  priori

principles of which are contained in pure philosophy which is therefore

connected although it must not be confounded with psychology empirical

psychology must therefore be banished from the sphere of metaphysics and is

indeed excluded by the very idea of that science in conformity however with

scholastic usage we must permit it to occupy a place in metaphysicsbut

only as an appendix to it we adopt this course from motives of economy as

psychology is not as yet full enough to occupy our attention as an independent

study while it is at the same time of too great importance to be entirely

excluded or placed where it has still less affinity than it has with the

subject of metaphysics it is a stranger who has been long a guest and we make

it welcome to stay until it can take up a more suitable abode in a complete

system of anthropologythe pendant to empirical physics




the above is the general idea of metaphysics which as more was expected from

it than could be looked for with justice and as these pleasant expectations

were unfortunately never realized fell into general disrepute our critique

must have fully convinced the reader that although metaphysics cannot form the

foundation of religion it must always be one of its most important bulwarks

and that human reason which naturally pursues a dialectical course cannot do

without this science which checks its tendencies towards dialectic and by

elevating reason to a scientific and clear selfknowledge prevents the ravages

which a lawless speculative reason would infallibly commit in the sphere of

morals as well as in that of religion we may be sure therefore whatever

contempt may be thrown upon metaphysics by those who judge a science not by its

own nature but according to the accidental effects it may have produced that

it can never be completely abandoned that we must always return to it as to a

beloved one who has been for a time estranged because the questions with which

it is engaged relate to the highest aims of humanity and reason must always

labour either to attain to settled views in regard to these or to destroy

those which others have already established




metaphysic thereforethat of nature as well as that of ethics but in

an especial manner the criticism which forms the propdeutic to all the

operations of reasonforms properly that department of knowledge which

may be termed in the truest sense of the word philosophy the path which it

pursues is that of science which when it has once been discovered is never

lost and never misleads mathematics natural science the common experience

of men have a high value as means for the most part to accidental

endsbut at last also to those which are necessary and essential to the

existence of humanity but to guide them to this high goal they require the

aid of rational cognition on the basis of pure conceptions which be it termed

as it may is properly nothing but metaphysics




for the same reason metaphysics forms likewise the completion of the culture

of human reason in this respect it is indispensable setting aside altogether

the influence which it exerts as a science for its subjectmatter is the

elements and highest maxims of reason which form the basis of the possibility

of some sciences and of the use of all that as a purely speculative science

it is more useful in preventing error than in the extension of knowledge does

not detract from its value on the contrary the supreme office of censor which

it occupies assures to it the highest authority and importance this office it

administers for the purpose of securing order harmony and wellbeing to

science and of directing its noble and fruitful labours to the highest

possible aimthe happiness of all mankind


chapter iv the history of pure reason


this title is placed here merely for the purpose of designating a division of

the system of pure reason of which i do not intend to treat at present i shall

content myself with casting a cursory glance from a purely transcendental

point of viewthat of the nature of pure reasonon the labours of

philosophers up to the present time they have aimed at erecting an edifice of

philosophy but to my eye this edifice appears to be in a very ruinous

condition




it is very remarkable although naturally it could not have been otherwise

that in the infancy of philosophy the study of the nature of god and the

constitution of a future world formed the commencement rather than the

conclusion as we should have it of the speculative efforts of the human mind

however rude the religious conceptions generated by the remains of the old

manners and customs of a less cultivated time the intelligent classes were not

thereby prevented from devoting themselves to free inquiry into the existence

and nature of god and they easily saw that there could be no surer way of

pleasing the invisible ruler of the world and of attaining to happiness in

another world at least than a good and honest course of life in this thus

theology and morals formed the two chief motives or rather the points of

attraction in all abstract inquiries but it was the former that especially

occupied the attention of speculative reason and which afterwards became so

celebrated under the name of metaphysics




i shall not at present indicate the periods of time at which the greatest

changes in metaphysics took place but shall merely give a hasty sketch of the

different ideas which occasioned the most important revolutions in this sphere

of thought there are three different ends in relation to which these

revolutions have taken place




1 in relation to the object of the cognition of reason philosophers may be

divided into sensualists and intellectualists epicurus may be regarded as the

head of the former plato of the latter the distinction here signalized

subtle as it is dates from the earliest times and was long maintained the

former asserted that reality resides in sensuous objects alone and that

everything else is merely imaginary the latter that the senses are the

parents of illusion and that truth is to be found in the understanding alone

the former did not deny to the conceptions of the understanding a certain kind

of reality but with them it was merely logical with the others it was

mystical the former admitted intellectual conceptions but declared that

sensuous objects alone possessed real existence the latter maintained that all

real objects were intelligible and believed that the pure understanding

possessed a faculty of intuition apart from sense which in their opinion

served only to confuse the ideas of the understanding




2 in relation to the origin of the pure cognitions of reason we find one

school maintaining that they are derived entirely from experience and another

that they have their origin in reason alone aristotle may be regarded as the

head of the empiricists and plato of the noologists locke the follower of

aristotle in modern times and leibnitz of plato although he cannot be said to

have imitated him in his mysticism have not been able to bring this question

to a settled conclusion the procedure of epicurus in his sensual system in

which he always restricted his conclusions to the sphere of experience was

much more consequent than that of aristotle and locke the latter especially

after having derived all the conceptions and principles of the mind from

experience goes so far in the employment of these conceptions and principles

as to maintain that we can prove the existence of god and the existence of god

and the immortality of them objects lying beyond the soulboth of them of

possible experiencewith the same force of demonstration as any

mathematical proposition




3 in relation to method method is procedure according to principles we may

divide the methods at present employed in the field of inquiry into the

naturalistic and the scientific the naturalist of pure reason lays it down as

his principle that common reason without the aid of sciencewhich he

calls sound reason or common sensecan give a more satisfactory answer

to the most important questions of metaphysics than speculation is able to do

he must maintain therefore that we can determine the content and

circumference of the moon more certainly by the naked eye than by the aid of

mathematical reasoning but this system is mere misology reduced to principles

and what is the most absurd thing in this doctrine the neglect of all

scientific means is paraded as a peculiar method of extending our cognition as

regards those who are naturalists because they know no better they are

certainly not to be blamed they follow common sense without parading their

ignorance as a method which is to teach us the wonderful secret how we are to

find the truth which lies at the bottom of the well of democritus




quod sapio satis est mihi non ego curo esse quod

arcesilas aerumnosiquesolones persius

satirae iii 7879

 is their motto under which they may lead a pleasant and

praiseworthy life without troubling themselves with science or troubling

science with them




as regards those who wish to pursue a scientific method they have now the

choice of following either the dogmatical or the sceptical while they are

bound never to desert the systematic mode of procedure when i mention in

relation to the former the celebrated wolf and as regards the latter david

hume i may leave in accordance with my present intention all others unnamed

the critical path alone is still open if my reader has been kind and patient

enough to accompany me on this hitherto untravelled route he can now judge

whether if he and others will contribute their exertions towards making this

narrow footpath a high road of thought that which many centuries have failed

to accomplish may not be executed before the close of the presentnamely

to bring reason to perfect contentment in regard to that which has always but

without permanent results occupied her powers and engaged her ardent desire

for knowledge

preface

this

translation of kants essay on perpetual peace was undertaken by

miss mary campbell smith at the suggestion of the late professor

ritchie of st andrews who had promised to write for it a preface

indicating the value of kants work in relation to recent discussions

regarding the possibility of making wars to cease in view of the

general interest which these discussions have aroused and of the

vague thinking and aspiration which have too often characterised

them it seemed to professor ritchie that a translation of this

wise and sagacious essay would be both opportune and valuable1 his

untimely death has prevented the fulfilment of his promise and i

have been asked in his stead to introduce the translators work
this is i think the only complete translation into english of

kants essay including all the notes as well as the text and the

translator has added a full historical introduction along with

numerous notes of her own so as in professor ritchies words to

meet the needs 1 of the student of politicalp vi science who wishes to understand the

relation of kants theories to those of grotius hobbes locke

rousseau etc and 2 of the general reader who wishes to understand

the significance of kants proposals in connection with the ideals of

peace congresses and with the development of international law from

the end of the middle ages to the hague conference
although it is more than 100 years since kants essay was written

its substantial value is practically unimpaired anyone who is

acquainted with the general character of the mind of kant will

expect to find in him sound commonsense clear recognition of the

essential facts of the case and a remarkable power of analytically

exhibiting the conditions on which the facts necessarily depend

these characteristics are manifest in the essay on perpetual

peace kant is not pessimist enough to believe that a perpetual

peace is an unrealisable dream or a consummation devoutly to be

feared nor is he optimist enough to fancy that it is an ideal which

could easily be realised if men would but turn their hearts to one

another for kant perpetual peace is an ideal not merely as a

speculative utopian idea with which in fancy we may play but as a

moral principle which ought to be and therefore can be realised

yet he makes it perfectly clear that we cannot hope to approach the

realisationp vii of

it unless we honestly face political facts and get a firm grasp of

the indispensable conditions of a lasting peace to strive after the

ideal in contempt or in ignorance of these conditions is a labour

that must inevitably be either fruitless or destructive of its own

ends thus kant demonstrates the hopelessness of any attempt to

secure perpetual peace between independent nations such nations may

make treaties but these are binding only for so long as it is not

to the interest of either party to denounce them to enforce them

is impossible while the nations remain independent there is as

professor ritchie put it studies in political and social ethics

p 169 only one way in which war between independent nations can

be prevented and that is by the nations ceasing to be independent

but this does not necessarily mean the establishment of a despotism

whether autocratic or democratic on the other hand kant maintains

that just as peace between individuals within a state can only be

permanently secured by the institution of a republican that is

to say a representative government so the only real guarantee

of a permanent peace between nations is the establishment of a

federation of free republican states such a federation he regards

as practically possible for if fortune ordains that a powerful

and enlightened people should form a republicp viiiwhich by its very nature is inclined

to perpetual peacethis would serve as a centre of federal union for

other states wishing to join and thus secure conditions of freedom

among the states in accordance with the idea of the law of nations

gradually through different unions of this kind the federation

would extend further and further
readers who are acquainted with the general philosophy of kant

will find many traces of its influence in the essay on perpetual

peace those who have no knowledge of his philosophy may find some

of his forms of statement rather difficult to understand and it

may therefore not be out of place for me to indicate very briefly

the meaning of some terms which he frequently uses especially in

the supplements and appendices thus at the beginning of the first

supplement kant draws a distinction between the mechanical and the

teleological view of things between nature and providence which

depends upon his main philosophical position according to kant pure

reason has two aspects theoretical and practical as concerning

knowledge strictly so called the a priori principles of reason

eg substance and attribute cause and effect etc are valid

only within the realm of possible senseexperience such ideas for

instance cannot be extended to god since he is not a possible

object of senseexperience they are limitedp ix to the world of phenomena this world of

phenomena nature or the world of senseexperience is a purely

mechanical system but in order to understand fully the phenomenal

world the pure theoretical reason must postulate certain ideas

the ideas of the soul the world and god the objects of which

transcend senseexperience these ideas are not theoretically valid

but their validity is practically established by the pure practical

reason which does not yield speculative truth but prescribes its

principles dogmatically in the form of imperatives to the will the

will is itself practical reason and thus it imposes its imperatives

upon itself the fundamental imperative of the practical reason is

stated by kant in appendix i p 175act so that thou canst will

that thy maxim should be a universal law be the end of thy action

what it will if the end of perpetual peace is a duty it must be

necessarily deduced from this general law and kant does regard it as

a duty we must desire perpetual peace not only as a material good

but also as a state of things resulting from our recognition of the

precepts of duty loc cit this is further expressed in the

maxim p 177seek ye first the kingdom of pure practical reason

and its righteousness and the object of your endeavour the blessing

of perpetual peace will be added unto you the distinction between

thep x moral politician

and the political moralist which is developed in appendix i is an

application of the general distinction between duty and expediency

which is a prominent feature of the kantian ethics methods of

expediency omitting all reference to the pure practical reason can

only bring about rearrangements of circumstances in the mechanical

course of nature they can never guarantee the attainment of their

end they can never make it more than a speculative ideal which may

or may not be practicable but if the end can be shown to be a duty

we have from kants point of view the only reasonable ground for a

conviction that it is realisable we cannot indeed theoretically

know that it is realisable reason is not sufficiently enlightened

to survey the series of predetermining causes which would make it

possible for us to predict with certainty the good or bad results

of human action as they follow from the mechanical laws of nature

although we may hope that things will turn out as we should desire

p 163 on the other hand since the idea of perpetual peace

is a moral ideal an idea of duty we are entitled to believe

that it is practicable nature guarantees the coming of perpetual

peace through the natural course of human propensities not indeed

with sufficient certainty to enable us to prophesy the future of

this ideal theoretically but yet clearlyp xi enough for practical purposes p 157

one might extend this discussion indefinitely but what has been said

may suffice for general guidance
the wise and sagacious thought of kant is not expressed in

a simple style and the translation has consequently been a very

difficult piece of work but the translator has shown great skill in

manipulating the involutions parentheses and prodigious sentences

of the original in this she has had the valuable help of mr david

morrison ma who revised the whole translation with the greatest

care and to whom she owes the solution of a number of difficulties

her work will have its fitting reward if it succeeds in familiarising

the englishspeaking student of politics with a political essay of

enduring value written by one of the master thinkers of modern

times

this

is an age of unions not merely in the economic sphere in

the working world of unworthy ends and few ideals do we find

great practical organizations but law medicine science art

trade commerce politics and political economywe might add

philanthropystanding institutions mighty forces in our social

and intellectual life all have helped to swell the number of our

nineteenth century conferences and congresses it is an age of

peace movements and peace societies of peaceloving monarchs and

peaceseeking diplomats this is not to say that we are preparing

for the millennium men are working together there is a newborn

solidarity of interest but rivalries between nation and nation

the bitternesses and hatreds inseparable from competition are

not less keen prejudice and misunderstanding not less frequent

subordinate conflicting interests are not fewer are perhaps in view

of changing political conditions and an evergrowing international

commerce multiplying with every year the talisman is perhaps

selfinterest but none the less the spirit of union is there

it is impossible to ignore a clearly markedp 2 tendency towards international federation

towards political peace this slow movement was not born with peace

societies its consummation lies perhaps far off in the ages to come

history at best moves slowly but something of its past progress

we shall do well to know no political idea seems to have so great

a future before it as this idea of a federation of the world it

is bound to realise itself some day let us consider what are the

chances that this day come quickly what that it be long delayed

what obstacles lie in the way and how may they be removed what

historical grounds have we for hoping that they may ever be removed

what in a word is the origin and history of the idea of a perpetual

peace between nations and what would be the advantage what is the

prospect of realising it
the international relations of states find their expression we

are told in war and peace what has been the part played by these

great counteracting forces in the history of nations what has it

been in prehistoric times in the life of man in what is called

the state of nature it is no easy enterprise says rousseau

in more than usually careful language to disentangle that which

is original from that which is artificial in the actual state of

man and to make ourselves well acquainted with a state which no

longer exists which perhapsp

3 never has existed and which probably never will exist in

the future preface to the discourse on the causes of inequality

1753 publ 1754 this is a difficulty which rousseau surmounts

only too easily a knowledge of history a scientific spirit may

fail him an imagination ever ready to pour forth detail never

does man lived says he without industry without speech

without habitation without war without connection of any kind

without any need of his fellows or without any desire to harm them

 sufficing to himself2 discourse on the sciences and arts

1750 nothing we are now certain is less probable we cannot

paint the life of man at this stage of his development with any

definiteness but the conclusion is forced upon us that our

race had no golden age3 no peaceful beginning that this early state

was indeed asp 4 hobbes

held a state of war of incessant war between individuals families

and finally tribes
the early conditions of society
for the barbarian war is the rule peace the exception his

gods like those of greece are warlike gods his spirit at death

flees to some valhalla for him life is one long battle his arms go

with him even to the grave food and the means of existence he seeks

through plunder and violence here right is with might the battle is

to the strong nature has given all an equal claim to all things but

not everyone can have them this state of fearful insecurity is bound

to come to an end government says locke on civil government

chap viii  105 is hardly to bep 5 avoided amongst men that live together4 a

constant dread of attack and a growing consciousness of the necessity

of presenting a united front against it result in the choice of some

leaderthe head of a family perhapswho acts it may be only as

captain of the hosts as did joshua in israel or who may discharge

the simple duties of a primitive governor or king5 peace within is found

to be strength without the civil state is established so that

if there needs must be war it may not yetp 6 be against all men nor yet without some

helps hobbes on liberty chap i  13 this foundation

of the state is the first establishment in history of a peace

institution it changes the character of warfare it gives it method

and system but it does not bring peace in its train we have now

indeed no longer a wholesale war of all against all a constant

irregular raid and plunder of one individual by another but we

have the systematic deliberate war of community against community

of nation against nation6
war in classical times
in early times there were no friendly neighbouring nations

beyond the boundaries of everyp

7 nations territory lay the land of a deadly foe this

was the way of thinking even of so highly cultured a people as the

greeks who believed that a law of nature had made every outsider

every barbarian their inferior and their enemy7 their treaties of peace

at the time of the persian war were frankly of the kind denounced

by kant mere armistices concluded for the purpose of renewing

their fighting strength the ancient world is a world of perpetual

war in which defeat meant annihilation in the east no right was

recognised in the enemy and even in greece and rome the fate of the

unarmed was death or slavery8 thep

8 barbaric or nongrecian states had according to plato

and aristotle no claim upon humanity nop 9 rights in fact of any kind among the

romans things were little better according to mr t j lawrencesee

his principles of international law iii  21 22they were

worse for rome stood alone in the world she was bound by ties of

kinship to no other state she was in other words free from a

sense of obligation to other races war according to roman ideas

was made by the gods apart altogether from the quarrels of rulers

or races to disobey the sacred command expressed in signs and

auguries would have been to hold in disrespect the law and religion

of the land when in the hour of victory the romans refrained from

pressing their rights against the conqueredrights recognised by all

roman juristsit was from no spirit of leniency but in the pursuit

of a prudent and farsighted policy aiming at the growth of roman

supremacy and the establishment of a worldembracing empire shutting

out all war as it blotted out natural boundaries reducing all rights

to the one right of imperial citizenship there was no real jus

belli even here in the cradle of international law the only limits

to the fury of war were of a religious character
the treatment of a defeated enemy among the jews rested upon

a similar religious foundation in the east we find a special

cruelty in the conduct of war the wars of the jews and assyrians

werep 10 wars of

extermination the whole of the old testament it has been said

resounds with the clash of arms9 an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth

was the command of jehovah to his chosen people vengeance was

bound up in their very idea of the creator the jews unlike the

followers of mahomet attempted and were commanded to attempt

no violent conversion10 they were then too weak a nation but they

fought and fought with success against the heathen of neighbouring

lands the lord of hosts leading them forth to battle the god

of israel stood to his chosen people in a unique and peculiarly

logical relation he had made a covenant with them and in return

for their obedience and allegiance cared for their interests and

advanced their national prosperity the blood of this elect people

could not be suffered to intermix with that of idolaters canaan

must be cleared of the heathen on the comingp 11 of the children of israel to their

promised land and mercy to the conquered enemy even to women

children or animals was held by the hebrew prophets to be treachery

to jehovah sam xv josh vi 21
hence the attitude of the jews to neighbouring nations11

was still more hostile than that of the greeks the cause of this

difference is bound up with the transition from polytheism to

monotheism the most devout worshipper of the national gods of

ancient times could endure to see other gods than his worshipped

in the next town or by a neighbouring nation there was no reason

why all should not exist side by side religious conflicts in

polytheistic countries when they arose were due not to the rivalry

of conflicting faiths but to an occasional attempt to put one god

above the others in importance there could be no interest here in

the propagation of belief through the sword but under the jews

these relations were entirely altered jehovah their creator became

the one invisible god such an one can suffer no others near him

their existence is a continual insult to him monotheism is in its

very nature a religion of intolerance its spirit among the jews

was warlike it commandedp

12 the subjugation of other nations but its instrument was

rather extermination than conversion
the attitude of christianity and the early church

to war
from the standpoint of the peace of nations we may say that

the christian faith compared with other prominent monotheistic

religious systems occupies an intermediate position between two

extremesthe fanaticism of islam and to a less extent of judaism

and the relatively passive attitude of the buddhist who thought

himself bound to propagate his religion but held himself justified

only in the employment of peaceful means christianity on the other

hand contains no warlike principles it can in no sense be called

a religion of the sword but circumstances gave the history of the

church after the first few centuries of its existence a character

which cannot be called peaceloving
this apparent contradiction between the spirit of the new religion

and its practical attitude to war has led to some difference of

opinion as to the actual teaching of christ the new testament

seems at a superficial glance to furnish support as readily to the

champions of war as to its denouncers the messiah is the prince of

peace is ix 6 7 heb vi and here lies the way ofp 13 righteousness rom

iii 19 but christ came not to bring peace but a sword matth

x 34 such statements may be given the meaning which we wish them

to bearthe quoting of scripture is ever an unsatisfactory form of

evidence but there is no direct statement in the new testament in

favour of war no saying of christ which fairly interpreted could

be understood too regard this proof of human imperfection as less

condemnable than any other12 when men shall be without sin nation shall

rise up against nation no more but man the individual can attain

peace only when he has overcome the world when in the struggle

with his lower self he has come forth victorious this is the

spiritual sword which christ brought into the worldstrife not with

the unbeliever but with the lower self meekness and the spirit of

the word of god are the weapons with which man must fight for the

faith
an elect people there was no longer israel had rejected its

messiah instead there was a complete brotherhood of all men the

bond and the free as children of one god the aim of the church

was a worldempire bound together by a universal religion in

this sense as sowing the first seeds of a universal peace we

may speakp 14 of

christianity as a reestablishment of peace among mankind
the later attitude of christians to war however by no means

corresponds to the earliest tenets of the church without doubt

certain sects from the beginning of our era and through the ages

up to the present time held like the mennonites and quakers in

our day that the divine command love your enemies could not be

reconciled with the profession of a soldier the early christians

were reproached under the roman emperors before the time of

constantine with avoiding the citizens duty of military service13 to

those enemies of our faith wrote origen contra celsum viii

ch lxxiii antinicene christian library who require us to

bear arms for the commonwealth and to slay men we can reply

do not those who are priests at certain shrines and those who

attend on certain gods as you account them keep their hands free

from blood that they may with hands unstained and free from human

blood offer the appointed sacrifices to yourp 15 gods and even when war is upon you you

never enlist the priests in the army if that then is a laudable

custom how much more so that while others are engaged in battle

these too should engage as the priests and ministers of god keeping

their hands pure and wrestling in prayers to god on behalf of those

who are fighting in a righteous cause and for the king who reigns

righteously that whatever is opposed to those who act righteously

may be destroyed  and we do take our part in public affairs

when along with righteous prayers we join selfdenying exercises and

meditations which teach us to despise pleasures and not to be led

away by them and none fight better for the king than we do we do

not indeed fight under him although he require it but we fight on

his behalf forming a special armyan army of pietyby offering our

prayers to god the fathers of the church justin martyr clement

of alexandria tertullian ambrose and the rest gave the same

testimony against war the pagan rites connected with the taking of

the military oath had no doubt some influence in determining the

feeling of the pious with regard to this life of bloodshed but the

reasons lay deeper shall it be held lawful asked tertullian

de corona p 347 to make an occupation of the sword when

the lord proclaims that he who uses the sword shall perishp 16 by the sword and shall

the son of peace take part in the battle when it does not become him

even to sue at law and shall he apply the chain and the prison and

the torture and the punishment who is not the avenger even of his

own wrongs
the doctrine of the church developed early in the opposite

direction it was its fighting spirit and not a love of peace that

made christianity a state religion under constantine nor was

augustine the first of the church fathers to regard military service

as permissible to come to a later time this change of attitude has

been ascribed partly to the rise of mahometan power and the wave of

fanaticism which broke over europe to destroy these unbelievers

with fire and sword was regarded as a deed of piety pleasing to

god hence the wars of the crusades against the infidel were holy

wars and appear as a new element in the history of civilisation

the nations of ancient times had known only civil and foreign war14

they had rebelled at home and they had fought mainly for material

interests abroad in the middle ages there were besides religious

wars and with the rise ofp

17 feudalism private war15 among all the powers

of the dark ages and for centuries later none was more aggressive

than the catholic church nor a more active and untiring defender of

its rights and claims spiritual or temporal it was in some respects

a more warlike institution than the states of greece and rome it

struggled through centuries with the emperor16 it pronounced its

ban against disobedient states and disloyal cities it pursued

with its vengeance each heretical or rebellious prince unmindful

of its early traditions about peace it showed in every crisis a

fiercely military spirit17
for more than a thousand years the churchp 18 counted fighting clergy18 among

its most active supporters this strange anomaly was it must be

said at first rather suffered in deference to public opinion than

encouraged by ecclesiastical canons and councils but it gave rise to

great discontent at the time of the reformation19 the whole question of

the lawfulness of military service for christians was then raised

again if there be anything in the affairs of mortals wrote

erasmus at this time opera ii prov 951 c which itp 19 becomes us deliberately

to attack which we ought indeed to shun by every possible means

to avert and to abolish it is certainly war than which there is

nothing more wicked more mischievous or more widely destructive

in its effects nothing harder to be rid of or more horrible and

in a word more unworthy of a man not to say of a christian20

the medival church indeed succeeded by the establishment of

such institutions as the truce of god in setting some limits

to the fury of the soldier but its endeavours and it made

several to promote peace21 were only to a trifling extent successful

perhaps custom and public opinion in feudal europe were too strong

perhaps the church showed a certain apathy in denouncing the evils of

a military society no doubt the theoretical tenets of its doctrine

did less to hinder war than its own strongly military tendency

itsp 20 lust for power

and the force of its example did to encourage it
hence in spite of christianity and its early vision of a

brotherhood of men the history of the middle ages came nearer to a

realization of the idea of perpetual war than was possible in ancient

times the tendency of the growth of roman supremacy was to diminish

the number of wars along with the number of possible causes of

racial friction it united many nations in one great whole and gave

them to a certain extent a common culture and common interests

even when this seemed prudent a common right of citizenship the

fewer the number of boundaries the less the likelihood of war the

establishment of great empires is of necessity a force and a great

and permanent force working on the side of peace with the fall of

rome this guarantee was removed
the development of the new science of

international law
out of the ruins of the old feudal system arose the modern

state as a free independent unity private war between

individuals or classes of society was now branded as a breach

of the peace it became the exclusive right of kings to appeal

top 21 force

war wrote gentilis22 towards the end of sixteenth century

is the just or unjust conflict between states peace was now

regarded as the normal condition of society as a result of these

great developments in which the name state acquired new meaning

jurisprudence freed itself from the trammelling conditions of

medival scholasticism men began to consider the problem of the

rightfulness or wrongfulness of war to question even the possibility

of a war on rightful grounds out of theses new ideaspartly

too as one of the fruits of the reformation23arose the first

consciously formulated principles of the science of international

law whose fuller but not yet complete development belongs to

modern times
from the beginning of history every age everyp 22 people has something

to show here be it only a rudimentary sense of justice in their

dealings with one another we may instance the amphictyonic league

in greece which while it had a merely hellenic basis and was mainly

a religious survival shows the germ of some attempt at arbitration

between greek states among the romans we have the jus feciale24

and the jus gentium as distinguished from the civil law of

rome and certain military regulations about the taking of booty

in war ambassadors were held inviolatep 23 in both countries the formal declaration

of war was never omitted many roman writers held the necessity of

a just cause for war but nowhere do these considerations form the

subject matter of a special science
in the middle ages the development of these ideas received

little encouragement all laws are silent in the time of war25 and

this was a period of war both bloody and constant there was no time

to think of the right or wrong of anything moreover the church

emphasised the lack of rights in unbelievers and gave her blessing

on their annihilation26 the whole christian world was filled with

the idea of a spiritual universal monarchy not such as that in

the minds of greek and jew and roman who had been able to picture

international peace only under the form of a great national and

exclusive empire in this great christian state there were to be no

distinctions between nations its sphere was bounded by the universe

but here there was no room or recognition for independent national

states with equal and personal rights this recognition opposed by

the romanp 24 church

is the real basis of international law the reformation was the means

by which the personality of the peoples the unity and independence

of the state were first openly admitted on this foundation mainly

at first in protestant countries the new science developed rapidly

like the civil state and the christian religion international law

may be called a peace institution
grotius puffendorf and vattel
in the beginning of the seventeenth century grotius laid the

foundations of a code of universal law de jure belli et pacis

1625 independent of differences of religion in the hope that its

recognition might simplify the intercourse between the newly formed

nations the primary object of this great work written during the

misery and horrors of the thirty years war was expressly to draw

attention to these evils and suggest some methods by which the

severity of warfare might be mitigated grotius originally meant to

explain only one chapter of the law of nations27 his book was top 25 be called de jure

belli but there is scarcely any subject of international law which

he leaves untouched he obtained moreover a general recognition

for the doctrine of the law of nature which exerted so strong an

influence upon succeeding centuries indeed between these two

sciences as between international law and ethics he draws no very

sharp line of demarcation although on the whole in spite of an

unscientific scholastic use of quotation from authorities his

treatment of thep 26

new field is clear and comprehensive grotius made the attempt to

set up an ethical principle of right in the stead of such doctrines

of selfinterest as had been held by many of the ancient writers

there was a law he held established in each state purely with a

view to the interests of that state but besides this there was

another higher law in the interest of the whole society of nations

its origin was divine the reason of man commanded his obedience

this was what we call international law28
grotius distinctly holds like kant and rousseau and unlike

hobbes that the state can never be regarded as a unity or

institution separable from the people the terms civitas

communitas coetus populus he uses indiscriminately but

these nations these independent units of society cannot live

together side by side just as they like they must recognise

one another as members of a european society of states29 law

he said stands above force even in war which may only be begun

to pursue the right and the beginning and manner of conduct of

war rests on fixed laws and can be justified only in certain cases

war is not to bep 27

done away with grotius accepts it as fact30 as hobbes did later

as the natural method for settling the disputes which were bound

constantly to arise between so many independent and sovereign

nations a terrible scourge it must ever remain but as the only

available form of legal procedure it is sanctioned by the practice

of states and not less by the law of nature and of nations grotius

did not advance beyond this position every violation of the law

of nations can be settled but in one wayby war the force of the

stronger
the necessary distinction between law and ethics was

drawn by puffendorf31 a successor of grotius who gave an

outwardly systematic form to the doctrine of the great jurist

without adding to itp

28 either strength or completeness his views when they

were not based upon the system of grotius were strongly influenced

by the speculation of hobbes his chronological predecessor to whom

we shall have later occasion to refer in the works of vattel32 who

was next to rousseau the most celebrated of swiss publicists we

find the theory of the customs and practice in war widely developed

and the necessity for humanising its methods and limiting its

destructive effects upon neutral countries strongly emphasised

grotius and puffendorf while they recommend acts of mercy hold that

there is legally no right which requires that a conquered enemy shall

be spared this is a matter of humanity alone it is to the praise

of vattel that he did much to popularise among the highest and most

powerful classes of society ideas of humanity in warfare and of

the rights and obligations of nations he is moreover the first to

make a clear separation between this science and the law of nature

what he asks is international law as distinguished from the law

of nature what are the powers of a state and the duties of nations

to one another what are the causes of quarrel among nations and

what the means by which they can be settled without any sacrifice of

dignity
p 29
they are in the first place a friendly conciliatory attitude

and secondly such means of settlement as mediation arbitration and

peace congresses these are the refuges of a peaceloving nation in

cases where vital interests are not at stake nature gives us no

right to use force except where mild and conciliatory measures are

useless law of nations ii ch xviii  331 every power owes

it in this matter to the happiness of human society to show itself

ready for every means of reconciliation in cases where the interests

at stake are neither vital nor important ibid  332 at the

same time it is never advisable that a nation should forgive an

insult which it has not the power to resent
the dream of a perpetual peace
but side by side with this development and gradual popularisation

of the new science of international law ideas of a less practical

but not less fruitful kind had been steadily making their way

and obtaining a strong hold upon the popular mind the decree of

eternal pacification of 1495 had abolished private war one of the

heavy curses of the middle ages why should it not be extended

to banish warfare between states as well gradually one proposal

after another was madep

30 to attain this end or at least to smooth the way for

its future realisation the first of these in point of time is to

be found in a somewhat bare vague form in sullys memoirs33 said

to have been published in 1634 half a century later the quaker

william penn suggested an international tribunal of arbitration

in the interests of peace34 but it was by the french abb st pierre

that the problem of perpetual peace was fairly introduced into

political literature and this in an age of cabinet and dynastic

wars while the dreary cost of the war of the spanish succession was

yet unpaid st pierre was the first who really clearly realised and

endeavoured to prove that the establishment of a permanent state of

peace is not only in the interest of the weaker but is required

by the european society of nations and by the reason of man from

the beginning of the history of humanity poets and prophets had

cherished the sweet dream of a peaceful civilisation it is in the

form of a practical project that this idea is new
the ancient world actually represented a statep 31 of what was almost

perpetual war this was the reality which confronted man his

inevitable doom it seemed as it had been pronounced to the fallen

sinners of eden peace was something which man had enjoyed once but

forfeited the myth and poetryloving greeks and later the poets

of rome delighted to paint a state of eternal peace not as something

to whose coming they could look forward in the future but as a

golden age of purity whose records lay buried in the past a paradise

which had been but which was no more voices more scientific were

raised even in greece in attempts such as aristotles to show

that the evolution of man had been not a course of degeneration

from perfection but of continual progress upwards from barbarism

to civilisation and culture but the change in popular thinking on

this matter was due less to the arguments of philosophy than to a

practical experience of the causes which operate in the interests

of peace the foundation of a universal empire under alexander the

great gave temporary rest to nations heretofore incessantly at war

here was a proof that the divine will had not decreed that man was

to work out his punishment under unchanging conditions of perpetual

warfare this idea of a universal empire became the greek ideal of a

perpetual peace such an empire was in the language of the stoics

a worldp 32state in

which all men had rights of citizenship in which all other nations

were absorbed
parallel to this ideal among the greeks we find the hope in

israel of a messiah whose coming was to bring peace not only to

the jewish race but to all the nations of the earth this idea

stands out in the sharpest contrast to the early nationalism of the

hebrew people who regarded every stranger as an idolater and an

enemy the prophecies of judaism combined with the cosmopolitan

ideas of greece were the source of the idea which is expressed in

the teaching of christ of a spiritual worldempire an empire held

together solely by the tie of a common religion
this hope of peace did not actually die during the first thousand

years of our era nor even under the morally stagnating influences

of the middle ages when feudalism and private war were abolished

in europe it wakened to a new life not merely in the mouths of

poets and religious enthusiasts was the cry raised against war but

by scholars like thomas more and erasmus jurists like gentilis

and grotius men high in the state and in the eyes of europe like

henry iv of france and the duc de sully or the abb de st pierre

whose projet de paix perptuelle 171335p 33 obtained immediate popularity and

widespread fame the first half of the eighteenth century was

already prepared to receive and mature a plan of this kind
henry iv and st pierre
the grand dessein of henry iv is supposed to have been formed

by that monarch and reproduced in sullys memoirs written in 1634

and discovered nearly a century later by st pierre the story goes

that the abb found the book buried in an old garden it has been

shewn however that there is little likelihood that this project

actually originated with the king who probably corresponded fairly

well to voltaires picture of him as war hero of the henriade the

plan was more likely conceived by sully and ascribed to the popular

king for the sake of the better hearing and greater influence it

might in this way be likely to have and also because thereby it

might be less likely to create offence in political circles st

pierre himself may or may not have been acquainted with the facts
the socalled grand dessein of henry iv was shortly

as follows36 it proposed to divide europep 34 between fifteen powers37 in

such a manner that the balance of power should be established and

preserved these were to form a christian republic on the basis

of the freedom and equality of its members the armed forces of

the federation being supported by fixed contribution a general

council consisting of representatives from the fifteen states

was to make all laws necessary for cementing the union thus formed

and for maintaining the order once established it would also be

the business of this senate to deliberate on questions that might

arise to occupy themselves with discussing different interests to

settle quarrels amicably to throw light upon and arrange all the

civil political and religious affairs of europe whether internal or

foreign mmoires vol vi p 129 seq
this scheme of the king or his minister was expanded with great

thoroughness and clearsightedness by the abb st pierre none of

the many later plans for a perpetual peace has been so perfect in

details he proposes that there should be a permanent and perpetual

union between if possible all christian sovereignsof whom he

suggests nineteen excluding the czarto preserve unbroken peace

in europe and that a permanent congressp 35 or senate should be formed by deputies

of the federated states the union should protect weak sovereigns

minors during a regency and so on and should banish civil as well

as international warit should render prompt and adequate assistance

to rulers and chief magistrates against seditious persons and

rebels all warfare henceforth is to be waged between the troops

of the federationeach nation contributing an equal numberand

the enemies of european security whether outsiders or rebellious

members of the union otherwise where it is possible all disputes

occurring within the union are to be settled by the arbitration of

the senate and the combined military force of the federation is

to be applied to drive the turks out of europe there is to be a

rational rearrangement of boundaries but after this no change is to

be permitted in the map of europe the union should bind itself to

tolerate the different forms of faith
the objections to st pierres scheme are many of them obvious

he himself produces sixtytwo arguments likely to be raised against

his plan and he examines these in turn with acuteness and eloquence

but there are other criticisms which he was less likely to be able

to forestall of the nineteen states he names as a basis of the

federation some have disappeared and the governments of others

have completely changed indeed st pierresp 36 scheme did not look far beyond the

present but it has besides a too strongly political character38

from this point of view the abbs plan amounts practically to

a european coalition against the ottoman empire moreover we

notice with a smile that the french statesman and patriot is not

lost in the cosmopolitan political reformer the kingdom of spain

shall not go out of the house of bourbon39 france is to enjoy more

than the privileges of honour she is to reap distinct material and

political advantages from the union humanity is to be a brotherhood

but in the federation of nations france is to stand first40

we see that these rves dun homme de bien as cardinal dubois

called them are not without their practical element but the

great mistake of st pierre is this he actually thought that

his plan could be put into execution in the near future that an

ideal of this kind was realisable at once41 i myselfp 37 formd it he says in

the preface in full expectation to see it one day executed as

hobbes says there can be nothing so absurd but may be found in

the books of philosophers42 st pierre was not content to make his

influence felt on the statesmen of his time and prepare the way for

the abolition of all arbitrary forms of government this was the flaw

which drew down upon the good abb voltaires sneering epigram43

and the irony of leibniz44 here above all in this unpractical

enthusiasm his scheme differs from that of kant
p

38rousseaus criticism of st pierre
rousseau took st pierres project45 much more seriously

than either leibniz or voltaire but sovereigns he thought are deaf

to the voice of justice the absolutism of princely power would never

allow a king to submit to a tribunal of nations moreover war was

according to rousseaus experience a matter not between nations but

between princes and cabinets it was one of the ordinary pleasures

of royal existence and one not likely to be voluntarily given up46 we

know that history has not supported rousseaus contention dynastic

wars are now no more the great powers have shown themselves able

to impose theirp 39

own conditions where the welfare and security of europe have seemed

to demand it such a development seemed impossible enough in the

eighteenth century in the military organisation of the nations of

europe and in the necessity of making their internal development

subordinate to the care for their external security rousseau saw the

cause of all the defects in their administration47 the formation of

unions on the model of the swiss confederation or the german bund

would he thought be in the interest of all rulers but great

obstacles seemed to him to lie in the way of the realisation of such

a project as that of st pierre without doubt says rousseau in

conclusion the proposal of a perpetual peace is at present an

absurd one it can only be put into effect by methods which are

violent in themselves and dangerous to humanity one cannot conceive

of the possibility of a federative union being established except

by a revolutionp 40

and that granted who among us would venture to say whether this

european federation is to be desired or to be feared it would work

perhaps more harm in a moment than it would prevent in the course of

centuries jugement sur la paix perptuelle
the position of hobbes
the most profound and searching analysis of this problem comes

from immanuel kant whose indebtedness in the sphere of politics

to hobbes locke montesquieu and rousseau it is difficult to

overestimate kants doctrine of the sovereignty of the people comes

to him from locke through rousseau his explanation of the origin

of society is practically that of hobbes the direct influence on

politics of this philosopher apart from his share in moulding the

kantian theory of the state is one we cannot afford to neglect his

was a great influence on the new science just thrown on the world by

grotius and his the first clear and systematic statement we have of

the nature of society and the establishment of the state the natural

state of man says hobbes is a state of war48 ap 41 bellum omnium contra omnes where all

struggle for honour and for preferment and the prizes to which every

individual is by natural right equally entitled but which can of

necessity fall only to the few the foremost in the race men hate

and fear the society of their kind but through this desirep 42 to excel are forced to

seek it only where there are many can there be a first this state

of things this apparent sociability which is brought about by and

coupled with the least sociable of instincts becomes unendurable

it is necessary to peace writes hobbes on dominion ch vi

3 that a man be so far forth protected against the violence of

others that he may live securely that is that he may have no just

cause to fear others so long as he doth them no injury indeed to

make men altogether safe from mutual harms so as they cannot be

hurt or injuriously killed is impossible and therefore comes not

within deliberation but to protect them so far as is possible the

state is formed hobbes has no great faith in human contracts or

promises mans nature is malicious and untrustworthy a coercive

power is necessary to guarantee this longdesired security within the

community we must therefore he adds provide for our security

not by compacts but by punishments and there is then sufficient

provision made when there are so great punishments appointed for

every injury as apparently it prove a greater evil to have done it

than not to have done it for all men by a necessity of nature

choose that which to them appears to be the less evil op cit

ch vi 4
these precautions secure that relative peacep 43 within the state which is one of the

conditions of the safety of the people but it is besides the duty

of a sovereign to guarantee an adequate protection to his subjects

against foreign enemies a state of defence as complete and perfect

as possible is not only a national duty but an absolute necessity

the following statement of the relation of the state to other states

shows how closely hobbes has been followed by kant there are

two things necessary says hobbes on dominion ch xiii 7

for the peoples defence to be warned and to be forearmed for

the state of commonwealths considered in themselves is natural

that is to say hostile49 neither if they cease from fighting is it

therefore to be called peace but rather a breathing time in which

one enemy observing the motion and countenance of the other values

his security not according to pacts but the forces and counsels of

his adversary
hobbes is a practical philosopher no man was less a dreamer a

follower after ideals than he he is moreover a pessimist and his

doctrine of the state is a political absolutism50 the form of

governp 44ment which

above all has been and is favourable to war he would no doubt have

ridiculed the idea of a perpetual peace between nations had such

a project as that of st pierrea practical project counting upon

a realisation in the near futurebeen brought before him he might

not even have accepted it in the very much modified form which kant

adopts that of an idealan unattainable idealtowards which humanity

could not do better than work he expected the worst possible from

man the individual homo homini lupus the strictest absolutism

amounting almost to despotism was required to keep the vicious

propensities of the human animal in check states he looked upon as

units of the same kind members also of a society they had and

openly exhibited the same faults as individual men they too might

be driven with a strong enough coercive force behind them but not

without it and such a coercive force as this did not exist in a

society of nations federation and federal troops are terms which

represent ideas of comparatively recent originp 45 without something of this kind any

enduring peace was not to be counted upon international relations

were and must remain at least potentially warlike in character under

no circumstances could ideal conditions be possible either between

the members of a state or between the states themselves human nature

could form no satisfactory basis for a counsel of perfection
hence hobbes never thought of questioning the necessity of war

it was in his eyes the natural condition of european society but

certain rules were necessary both for its conduct and where this

was compatible with a nations dignity and prosperity for its

prevention he held that international law was only a part of the

law of nature and that this law of nature laid certain obligations

upon nations and their kings mediation must be employed between

disputants as much as possible the person of the mediators of

peace being held inviolate an umpire ought to be chosen to decide

a controversy to whose judgment the parties in dispute agree to

submit themselves such an arbiter must be impartial these are all

what hobbes calls precepts of the law of nature and he appeals to

the scriptures in confirmation of his assertion that peace is the

way of righteousness and that the laws of nature of which these

are a few are also laws of the heavenly kingdom but peace is like

thep 46 straight path

of christian endeavour difficult to find and difficult to keep

we must seek after it where it may be found but having done this

and sought in vain we have no alternative but to fall back upon

war reason requires that every man ought to endeavour peace

lev i ch xiv as far as he has hope of obtaining it and

when he cannot obtain it that he may seek and use all helps

and advantages of war51 this says hobbes elsewhere on liberty

ch i 15 is the dictate of right reason the first and fundamental

law of nature
kants idea of a perpetual peace
with regard to the problems of international law kant is of

course a hundred and fifty years ahead of hobbes but he starts from

the same point his theory of the beginning of society is practically

identical with that of the older philosopher men are by nature

imperfect creatures unsociable and untrustworthy cursed by a love

of glory of possession and of power passions which make happiness

something for ever unattainable by them hobbes is content to leave

them here with their imperfections and let a strong governmentp 47 help them out as it may

but not so kant he looks beyond man the individual developing

slowly by stages scarcely measurable progressing at one moment

and the next as it seems falling behind he looks beyond the

individual struggling and never attaining to the race here kant

is no pessimist the capacities implanted in man by nature are not

all for evil they are he says destined to unfold themselves

completely in the course of time and in accordance with the end

to which they are adapted idea of a universal history from a

cosmopolitan point of view 1784 prop 1 this end of humanity is

the evolution of man from the stage of mere selfsatisfied animalism

to a high state of civilisation through his own reason man is to

attain a perfect culture intellectual and moral in this long period

of struggle the potential faculties which nature or providence has

bestowed upon him reach their full development the process in which

this evolution takes place is what we call history
to man nature has given none of the perfect animal equipments

for selfpreservation and selfdefence which she has bestowed

on others of her creatures but she has given to him reason and

freedom of will and has determined that through these faculties

and without the aid of instinct he shall win for himself a complete

development of his capacities and natural endowments it is

saysp 48 kant no happy

life that nature has marked out for man he is filled with desires

which he can never satisfy his life is one of endeavour and not of

attainment not even the consciousness of the wellfought battle is

his for the struggle is more or less an unconscious one the end

unseen only in the race and not in the individual can the natural

capacities of the human species reach full development reason says

kant prop 2 op cit does not itself work by instinct but

requires experiments exercise and instruction in order to advance

gradually from one stage of insight to another hence each individual

man would necessarily have to live an enormous length of time in

order to learn by himself how to make a complete use of all his

natural endowments or if nature should have given him but a short

lease of life as is actually the case reason would then require an

almost interminable series of generations the one handing down its

enlightenment to the other in order that the seeds she has sown in

our species may be brought at last to a stage of development which

is in perfect accordance with her design man the individual shall

travel towards the land of promise and fight for its possession

but not he nor his children nor his childrens children shall

inherit the land only the latest comers can have the good fortune

of inhabitingp 49

the dwelling which the long series of their predecessors have

toiledthough adds kant without any conscious intentto build up

without even the possibility of participating in the happiness which

they were preparing proposition 3
the means which nature employs to bring about this development of

all the capacities implanted in men is their mutual antagonism in

societywhat kant calls the unsocial sociableness of men that is to

say their inclination to enter into society an inclination which

yet is bound up at every point with a resistance which threatens

continually to break up the society so formed proposition 4 man

hates society and yet there alone he can develop his capacities he

cannot live there peaceably and yet cannot live without it it is

the resistance which others offer to his inclinations and willwhich

he on his part shows likewise to the desires of othersthat awakens

all the latent powers of his nature and the determination to conquer

his natural propensity to indolence and love of material comfort

and to struggle for the first place among his fellowcreatures to

satisfy in outstripping them his love of glory and possession and

power without those in themselves by no means lovely qualities

which set man in social opposition to man so that each finds his

selfish claims resisted by the selfishness of all the others men

would have livedp 50

on in an arcadian shepherd life in perfect harmony contentment

and mutual love but all their talents would forever have remained

hidden and undeveloped thus kindly as the sheep they tended they

would scarcely have given to their existence a greater value than

that of their cattle and the place among the ends of creation which

was left for the development of rational beings would not have been

filled thanks be to nature for the unsociableness for the spiteful

competition of vanity for the insatiate desires of gain and power

without these all the excellent natural capacities of humanity

would have slumbered undeveloped mans will is for harmony but

nature knows better what is good for his species her will is for

dissension he would like a life of comfort and satisfaction but

nature wills that he should be dragged out of idleness and inactive

content and plunged into labour and trouble in order that he may be

made to seek in his own prudence for the means of again delivering

himself from them the natural impulses which prompt this effortthe

causes of unsociableness and mutual conflict out of which so many

evils springare also in turn the spurs which drive him to the

development of his powers thus they really betray the providence

of a wise creator and not the interference of some evil spirit

which has meddled with the world which god hasp 51 nobly planned and enviously overturned

its order proposition 4 cairds translation in the critical

philosophy of kant vol ii pp 550 551
the problem now arises how shall men live together each free to

work out his own development without at the same time interfering

with a like liberty on the part of his neighbour the solution

of this problem is the state here the liberty of each member is

guaranteed and its limits strictly defined a perfectly just civil

constitution administered according to the principles of right

would be that under which the greatest possible amount of liberty

was left to each citizen within these limits this is the ideal

of kant and here lies the greatest practical problem which has

presented itself to humanity an ideal of this kind is difficult of

realisation but nature imposes no such duty upon us out of such

crooked material as man is made says kant nothing can be hammered

quite straight proposition 6 we must make our constitution as

good as we can and with that rest content
the direct cause of this transition from a state of nature

and conditions of unlimited freedom to civil society with its

coercive and restraining forces is found in the evils of that

state of nature as they are painted by hobbes a wild lawless

freedom becomes impossible for man he is compelled top 52 seek the protection

of a civil society he lives in uncertainty and insecurity his

liberty is so far worthless that he cannot peacefully enjoy

it for this peace he voluntarily yields up some part of his

independence the establishment of the state is in the interest of

his development to a higher civilisation it is morethe guarantee

of his existence and selfpreservation this is the sense says

professor paulsen in which kant like hobbes regards the state as

resting on a contract52 thatp

53 is to say on the free will of all53 volenti non fit

injuria only adds paulsen we must remember that this contract

is not a historical fact as it seemed to some writers of the

eighteenth century but an idea of reason we are speaking here not

of the history of the establishment of the state but of the reason

of its existence paulsens kant p 35454
p 54
in this civil union selfsought yet sought reluctantly man is

able to turn his most unlovable qualities to a profitable use they

bind this society together they are the instrument by which he wins

for himself selfculture it is here with men says kant as it is

with the trees in a forest just because each one strives to deprive

the other of air and sun they compel each other to seek both above

and thus they grow beautiful and straight whereas those that in

freedom and isolation from one another shoot out their branches at

will grow stunted and crooked and awry proposition 5 op cit

culture art and all that is best in the social order are the fruits

of that selfloving unsociableness in man
the problem of the establishment of a perfect civil constitution

cannot be solved says this treatise idea for a universal

history until the external relations of states are regulated

in accordance with principles of right for even if the ideal

internal constitution were attained what end would it serve in the

evolution of humanity if commonwealths themselves were to remain

like individuals in a state of nature each existing in uncontrolled

freedom a law unto himself this condition of things again cannot

be permanent nature uses the same means as before to bring about

a state of law and order war present or near at hand the

strainp 55 of constant

preparation for a possible future campaign or the heavy burden of

debt and devastation left by the lastthese are the evils which must

drive states to leave a lawless savage state of nature hostile to

mans inward development and seek in union the end of nature peace

all wars are the attempts nature makes to bring about new political

relations between nations relations which in their very nature

cannot be and are not desired to be permanent these combinations

will go on succeeding each other until at last a federation of all

powers is formed for the establishment of perpetual peace this is

the end of humanity demanded by reason justice will reign not only

in the state but in the whole human race when perpetual peace exists

between the nations of the world
this is the point of view of the idea for a universal history

but equally we may say law and justice will reign between

nations when a legally and morally perfect constitution adorns the

state external perpetual peace presupposes internal peacepeace

civil social economic religious now when men are perfectand

what would this be but perfectionhow can there be war cardinal

fleurys only objectionno light oneto st pierres project was

that as even the most peaceloving could not avoid war all men

must first be men of noble character this seems to be what is

requiredp 56 in the

treatise on perpetual peace kant demands to a certain extent

the moral regeneration of man there must be perfect honesty in

international dealings good faith in the interpretation and

fulfilment of treaties and so on art 155 and again every

state must have a republican constitutiona term by which kant

understands a constitution as nearly as possible in accordance with

the spirit of right art 156 this is to say that we have to start with

our reformation at home look first to the culture and education

and morals of our citizens then to our foreign relations this is

a question of selfinterest as well as of ethics on the civil and

religious liberty of a state depends its commercial success kant

saw the day coming when industrial superiority was to be identified

with political preeminence the state which does not look to the

enlightenment and liberty of its subjects must fail in the race but

the advantages of a high state of civilisation are not all negative

the more highly developed the individuals who form a state the more

highly developed is its consciousness of its obligations to other

nations in the ignorance and barbarism of races lies the great

obstacle to a reign of law among states uncivilised states cannot be

conceived as members of a federation of europep 57 first the perfect civil constitution

according to right then the federation of these lawabiding powers

this is the path which reason marks out the treatise on perpetual

peace seems to be in this respect more practical than the idea

for a universal history but it matters little which way we take

it the point of view is the same in both cases the end remains

the development of man towards good the order of his steps in this

direction is indifferent
the political and social conditions of kants

time
the history of the human race viewed as a whole kant regards

as the realisation of a hidden plan of nature to bring about a

political constitution internally and externally perfectthe only

condition under which the faculties of man can be fully developed

does experience support this theory kant thought that to a certain

degree it did this conviction was not however a fruit of his

experience of citizenship in prussia an absolute dynastic state

a military monarchy waging perpetual dynastic wars of the kind he

most hotly condemned kant had no feeling of love to prussia57

and little of a citizens patriotic pride or even inp 58terest in its political

achievements this was partly because of his sympathy with republican

doctrines partly due to his love of justice and peculiar hatred of

war58

a hatred based no doubt not less on principle than on a close

personal experience of the wretchedness it brings with it it was

not the political and social conditions in which he lived which

fostered kants love of liberty and gave him inspiration unless

in the sense in which the mind reacts upon surrounding influences

looking beyondp 59

prussia to america in whose struggle for independence he took a keen

interest and looking to france where the old dynastic monarchy had

been succeeded by a republican state kant seemed to see the signs of

a coming democratisation of the old monarchical society of europe in

this growing influence on the state of the mass of the people who had

everything to lose in war and little to gain by victory he saw the

guarantee of a future perpetual peace other forces too were at work

to bring about this consummation there was a growing consciousness

that war this costly means of settling a dispute is not even a

satisfactory method of settlement hazardous and destructive in its

effect it is also uncertain in its results victory is not always

gain it no longer signifies a land to be plundered a people to

be sold to slavery it brings fresh responsibilities to a nation

at a time when it is not always strong enough to bear them but

above all kant saw even at the end of the eighteenth century the

nations of europe so closely bound together by commercial interests

that a warand especially a maritime war where the scene of conflict

cannot be to the same extent localised as on landbetween any two of

them could not but seriously affect the prosperity of the others59

hep 60 clearly realised

that the spirit of commerce was the strongest force in the service of

the maintenance of peace and that in it lay a guarantee of future

union
this scheme of a federation of the nations of the world in

accordance with principles which would put an end to war between

them was one whose interest for kant seemed to increase during the

last twenty years of his life60 it was according to him an idea of reason

and in his first essay on the subjectthat of 1784we see the

place this ideal of a perpetual peace held in the kantian system

of philosophy its realisation is the realisation of the highest

goodthe ethical and political summum bonum for here the aims

of morals and politics coincide only in a perfect development of

his faculties in culture and in morals can man at last find true

happiness history is working towards the consummation of this end a

moral obligation lies on man to strive to establish conditions which

bring its realisation nearer it is the duty of statesmen to form a

federative union as it was formerly the duty of individuals to enter

the state the moral law points the way here as clearly as in the

sphere of pure ethicsthou canst therefore thou oughtst
p 61 let us

be under no misapprehension as to kants attitude to the problem of

perpetual peace it is an ideal he states plainly that he so regards

it61

and that as such it is unattainable but this is the essence of

all ideals they have not the less value in shaping the life and

character of men and nations on that account they are not ends to

be realised but ideas according to which we must live regulative

principles we cannot says kant shape our life better than in

acting as if such ideas of reason have objective validity and there

be an immortal life in which man shall live according to the laws of

reason in peace with his neighbour and in freedom from the trammels

of sense
hence we are concerned here not with an end but with the means

by which we might best set about attaining it if it were attainable

this is the subject matter of the treatise on perpetual peace

1795 a less eloquent and less purely philosophical essay than that

of 1784 but throughout more systematic and practical we have to do

not with the favourite dream of philanthropists like st pierre and

rousseau but with a statement of the conditions on the fulfilment of

which the transition to a reign of peace and law depends
p

62the conditions of the realisation of the kantian

ideal
these means are of two kinds in the first place what evils

must we set about removing what are the negative conditions and

secondly what are the general positive conditions which will make

the realisation of this idea possible and guarantee the permanence

of an international peace once attained these negative and

positive conditions kant calls preliminary and definitive articles

respectively the whole essay being carefully thrown into the form of

a treaty the preliminary articles of a treaty for perpetual peace

are based on the principle that anything that hinders or threatens

the peaceful coexistence of nations must be abolished these

conditions have been classified by kuno fischer kant he points

out62

examines the principles of right governing the different sets of

circumstances in which nations find themselvesnamely a while

they are actually at war b when the time comes to conclude a

treaty of peace c when they are living in a state of peace

the six preliminary articles fall naturally into these groups war

must not be conducted in such a manner as to increase national

hatred and embitter a futurep

63 peace art 663 the treaty which brings hostilities to an

end must be concluded in an honest desire for peace art 164 again

a nation when in a state of peace must do nothing to threaten the

political independence of another nation or endanger its existence

thereby giving the strongest of all motives for a fresh war a nation

may commit this injury in two ways 1 indirectly by causing

danger to others through the growth of its standing army art 365always

a menace to the state of peaceor by any unusual war preparations

and 2 through too great a supremacy of another kind by

amassing money the most powerful of all weapons in warfare the

national debt art 466 is another standing danger to the peaceful

coexistence of nations but besides we have the danger of actual

attack there is no right of intervention between nations art

567

nor can states be inherited or conquered art 268 or in any way treated

in a manner subversive of their independence and sovereignty as

individuals for a similar reason armed troops cannot be hired and

sold as things
p 64
these then are the negative conditions of peace69

there are besides three positive conditions p 65 a

the intercourse of nations is to be confined to a right of

hospitality art 370 there is nothing new to us in this

assertion of a right of way the right to free means of international

communication has in the last hundred years become a commonplace of

law and the change has been brought about as kant anticipated

not through an abstract respect for the idea of right but through

the pressure of purely commercial interests since kants time

the nations of europe have all been more or less transformed from

agricultural to commercial states whose interests run mainly in the

same direction whose existence and development depend necessarily

upon conditions of universal hospitality commerce depends upon

this freedom of international intercourse and on commerce mainly

depends our hope of peace
b the first definitive article71 requires that the

constitution of every state should be republican what kant

understands by this term is that in the state law should rule

above force and that itsp

66 constitution should be a representative one guaranteeing

public justice and based on the freedom and equality of its members

and their mutual dependence on a common legislature kants demand

is independent of the form of the government a constitutional

monarchy like that of prussia in the time of frederick the great

who regarded himself as the first servant of the state and ruled

with the wisdom and forethought which the nation would have had

the right to demand from such an onesuch a monarchy is not in

contradiction to the idea of a true republic that the state should

have a constitution in accordance with the principles of right

is the essential point72 to makep 67 this possible the lawgiving power

must lie with the representatives of the people there must be a

complete separation such as locke and rousseau demand between

the legislature and executive otherwise we have despotism hence

while kant admitted absolutism under certain conditions he rejected

democracy where in his opinion the mass of the people was

despot
an internal constitution firmly established on the principles of

right would not only serve to kill the seeds of national hatred and

diminish the likelihood of foreign war it would do more it would

destroy sources of revolution and discontent within the state kant

like many writers on this subject does not directly allude to civil

war73

andp 68 the means by

which it may be prevented or abolished actually to achieve this

would be impossible it is beyond the power of either arbitration or

disarmament but in a representative government and the liberty of a

people lie the greatest safeguards against internal discontent civil

peace and international peace must to a certain extent go hand in

hand
we come now to the central idea of the treatise c the law

of nations must be based upon a federation of free states art

274

this must be regarded as the end to which mankind is advancing the

problem here is not out of many nations to make one this would

be perhaps the surest way to attain peace but it is scarcely

practicable and in certain forms it is undesirable kant is

inclined to approve of the separation of nations by language and

religion by historical and social tradition and physical boundaries

nature seems to condemn the idea of a universal monarchy75 the

only footingp 69

on which a thoroughgoing indubitable system of international

law is in practice possible is that of the society of nations

not the worldrepublic76 the greeks dreamt of but a federation of

states such a union in the interests of perpetual peace between

nations would be the highest political good the relation of the

federated states to one another and to the whole would be fixed by

cosmopolitan law the link of selfinterest which would bind them

would again be the spirit of commerce
this scheme of a perpetual peace had not escaped ridicule

in the eighteenth century the name ofp 70 kant protected it henceforth the facts

of history even more conclusively than the voices of philosophers

soldiers and princes show how great has been the progress of this

idea in recent years but it has not gained its present hold upon the

popular mind without great and lasting opposition indeed we have

here what must still be regarded as a controversial question there

have been and are still men who regard perpetual peace as a state

of things as undesirable as it is unattainable for such persons

war is a necessity of our civilisation it is impossible that it

should ever cease to exist all that we can do and there is no

harm nor any contradiction in the attempt is to make wars shorter

fewer and more humane the whole question beyond this is without

practical significance others on the other handand these perhaps

more thoughtfulregard war as hostile to culture an evil of the

worst kind although a necessary evil in peace for them lies the

true ideal of humanity although in any perfect form this cannot be

realised in the near future the extreme forms of these views are to

be sought in what has been called in germany the philosophy of the

barracks which comes forward with a glorification of war for its own

sake and in the attitude of modern peace societies which denounce

all war wholesale without respect of causes or conditions
p

71hegel schiller and moltke
hegel the greatest of the champions of war would have nothing

to do with kants federation of nations formed in the interests

of peace the welfare of a state he held is its own highest

law and he refused to admit that this welfare was to be sought

in an international peace hegel lived in an age when all power

and order seemed to lie with the sword something of the charm of

napoleonism seems to hang over him he does not go the length of

writers like joseph de maistre who see in war the finger of god

or an arrangement for the survival of the fittesta theory as

far as regards individuals quite in contradiction with the real

facts which show that it is precisely the physically unfit whom

war as a method of extermination cannot reach but like schiller

and moltke hegel sees in war an educative instrument developing

virtues in a nation which could not be fully developed otherwise

much as pain and suffering bring patience and resignation and other

such qualities into play in the individual and drawing the nation

together making each citizen conscious of his citizenship as no

other influence can war he holds leaves a nation always stronger

than it was before it buries causes of inner dissension and

consolidates thep 72

internal power of the state77 no other trial can in the same way show

what is the real strength and weakness of a nation what it is not

merely materially but physically intellectually and morally
with this last statement most people will be inclined to agree

there is only a part of the truth in napoleons dictum that god is

on the side of the biggest battalions or in the old saying that war

requires three necessariesin the first place money in the second

place money and in the third money money is a great deal it is a

necessity but what we call national backbone and character is more

so far we are with hegel but he goes further in peace says he

mankind would grow effeminate and degenerate in luxury this opinion

was expressed in forcible language in his own time by schiller78

and in morep 73

recent years by count moltke perpetual peace says a letter

of the great general79 is a dream and not a beautiful dream

either war is part of the divine order of the world during war

are developed the noblest virtues which belong to mancourage and

selfdenial fidelity to duty and the spirit of selfsacrifice

the soldier is called upon to risk his life without war the world

would sink in materialism80 want and misery disease suffering

and war he says elsewhere are allp 74 given elements in the divine order

of the universe moltkes eulogy of war however is somewhat

modified by his additional statement that the greatest kindness in

war lies in its being quickly ended letter to bluntschli 11th

decp 75 188081 the

great forces which we recognise as factors in the moral regeneration

of mankind are always slow of action as they are sure war if too

quickly over could not have the great moral influence which has been

attributed to it the explanation may be that it is not all that it

naturally appears to a great and successful general hegel moltke

trendelenburg treitschke82 and the othersnot schiller83 who

was able to sing the blessings of peace as eloquently as of warwere

apt to forget that war is as efficient a school for forming vices

as virtues and that moreover those virtues which military life

is said to cultivatecourage selfsacrifice and the restcan be at

least as perfectly developed in other trials there are in human

life dangers every day bravely met and overcome which are not less

terrible than those which face the soldier in whom patriotism may

be less a sentiment than a duty and whose cowardice must be dearly

paid
war under altered conditions
the peace societies of our century untiring supporters of a point

of view diametrically oppositep

76 to that of hegel owe their existence in the first

place to new ideas on the subject of the relative advantages and

disadvantages of war which again were partly due to changes in the

character of war itself partly to a new theory that the warfare

of the future should be a war of free competition for industrial

interests or in herbert spencers language that the warlike type

of mankind should make room for an industrial type this theory

amounting in the minds of some thinkers to a fervid conviction

and itself in a sense the source of what has been contemptuously

styled our british shopkeepers policy in europe was based on

something more solid than mere enthusiasm the years of peace which

followed the downfall of napoleon had brought immense increase in

material wealth to countries like france and britain something of

the glamour had fallen away from the sword of the great emperor the

illusive excitement of a desire for conquest had died the glory of

war had faded with it but the burden still remained its cost was

still there something to be calmly reckoned up and not soon to be

forgotten europe was seen to be actually moving towards ruin we

shall have to get rid of war in all civilised countries said louis

philippe in 1843 soon no nation will be able to afford it war

was not only becoming more costly new conditions had altered it in

other directionsp 77

with the development of technical science and its application to the

perfecting of methods and instruments of destruction every new war

was found to be bloodier than the last and the day seemed to be in

sight when this very development would make war with instruments of

extermination impossible altogether the romance and picturesqueness

with which it was invested in the days of handtohand combat was

gone but above all war was now waged for questions fewer and more

important than in the time of kant napoleons successful appeal

to the masses had suggested to prussia the idea of consciously

nationalising the army our modern national wars exact a sacrifice

necessarily much more heavy much more reluctantly made than those

of the past which were fought with mercenary troops such wars have

not only greater dignity they are more earnest and their issue as

in a sense the issue of conflict between higher and lower types of

civilisation is speedier and more decisive
in the hundred years since kants death much that he prophesied

has come to pass although sometimes by different paths than he

anticipated the strides made in recent years by commerce and

the growing power of the people in every state have had much of

the influence which he foretold there is a greater reluctance

to wagep 78 war84

but unfortunately as professor paulsen points out the progress

of democracy and the nationalisation of war have not worked merely

in the direction of progress towards peace war has now become

popular for the first time the progress of democracy in states

he says kant p 36485 has not only not done away with war

but has very greatly changed the feeling of people towards it with

the universal military service introduced by the revolution war

has become the peoples affair and popular as it could not be in

the case of dynastic wars carried on with mercenary troops in the

people the love of peace is strong but so too is the love of a

fight the love of victory
it is in the contemplation of facts and conflicting

tendencies like these that peace societies86 have been formed

the peace party is we may say an eclectic body it embraces many

different sections of political opinion there are those who hold

for instance that peace is to be established on a basis of communism

of property there are others who insist on the establishment

throughout europe of a republican form of government or again on

ap 79 redistribution

of european territory in which alsacelorraine is restored to

francechanges of which at least the last two would be difficult to

carry out unless through international warfare but these are not

the fundamental general principles of peace workers the members

of this party agree in rejecting the principle of intervention in

demanding a complete or partial disarmament of the nations of europe

and in requiring that all disputes between nationsand they admit the

prospects of disputeshould be settled by means of arbitration in

how far are these principles useful or practicable
the value of arbitration
there is a strong feeling in favour of arbitration on the part

of all classes of society it is cheaper under all circumstances

than war it is a judgment at once more certain and more complete

excluding as far as possible the element of chance leaving

irritation perhaps behind it but none of the lasting bitterness

which is the legacy of every war arbitration has an important place

in all peace projects except that of kant whose federal union

would naturally fulfil the function of a tribunal of arbitration

st pierre jeremy bentham87p

80 bluntschli88 the german publicist professor lorimer89

and others among political writers90 and among rulers

louis napoleon and the emperor alexander i of russia have all made

proposals more or less ineffectual for the peaceful settlement of

international disputes a number of cases have already been decided

by this means but let us examine the questions which have been

at issue of a hundred and thirty matters of dispute settled by

arbitration since 1815 cf international tribunals published

by the peace society 1899 it will be seen that all with the

exception of one or two trifling cases of doubt as to the succession

to certain titles or principalities can be classified roughly

under two headsdisputes as to the determination of boundaries or

the possession of certain territory and questions of claims for

compensation and indemnities due either to individuals or states

arising from the seizure of fleets or merchant vessels the insult

or injury to private persons and so onbriefly questions of money

or of territoryp 81

these may fairly be said to be trifling causes not touching

national honour or great political questions that they should have

been settled in this way however shows a great advance smaller

causes than these have made some of the bloodiest wars in history

that arbitration should have been the means of preventing even one

war which would otherwise have been waged is a strong reason why

we should fully examine its claims quand linstitution dune

haute cour writes laveleye des causes actuelles de guerre en

europe et de larbitrage nviterait quune guerre sur vingt

il vaudrait encore la peine de ltablir but history shows us

that there is no single instance of a supreme conflict having been

settled otherwise than by war arbitration is a method admirably

adapted to certain cases to those we have named where it has been

successfully applied to the interpretation of contracts to offences

against the law of nationssome writers say to trivial questions of

honourin all cases where the use of armed force would be impossible

as for instance in any quarrel in which neutralised countries91

like belgium or luxembourg should take a principal part or in a

difference between two nations such as to take an extreme case the

united states and switzerlandp

82 which could not easily engage in actual combat these

cases which we cannot too carefully examine show that what is here

essential is that it should be possible to formulate a juridical

statement of the conflicting claims in germany the bundestag had

only power to decide questions of law other disputes were left to be

fought out questions on which the existence and vital honour of a

state dependany question which nearly concerns the disputantscannot

be reduced to any cut and dry legal formula of right and wrong

we may pass over the consideration that in some cases as in the

francoprussian war the delay caused by seeking mediation of any

kind would deprive a nation of the advantage its state of military

preparation deserved and we may neglect the problem of finding an

impartial judge on some questions of dispute although its solution

might be a matter of extreme difficulty so closely are the interests

of modern nations bound up in one another how could the eastern

question for example be settled by arbitration it is impossible

that such a means should be sufficient for every case arbitration in

other words may prevent war but can never be a substitute for war

we cannot wonder that this is so so numerous and conflicting are

the interests of states so various are the grades of civilisation

to which they have attained and the directionsp 83 along which they are developing that

differences of the most vital kind are bound to occur and these can

never be settled by any peaceful means at present known to europe

this is above all true where the selfpreservation92 or independence of

a people are concerned here the goodwill of the nations who

disagree would necessarily be wanting there could be no question of

the arbitration of an outsider
but indeed looking away from questions so vital and on which

there can be little difference of opinion we are apt to forget

when we allow ourselves to talk extravagantly of the future of

arbitration that every nation thinks or at least pretends to think

that it is in the right in every dispute in which it appears cf

kant perpetual peace p 120 and as a matter of history

therep 84 has never

been a conflict between civilised states in which an appeal to this

right on the part of each has not been made we talk glibly of

the right and wrong of this question or of that of the justice of

this war the iniquity of that but what do these terms really mean

do we know in spite of the labour which has been spent on this

question by the older publicists which are the causes that justify

a war is it not true that the same war might be just in one set

of circumstances and unjust in another practically all writers on

this subject exclusive of those who apply the biblical doctrine of

nonresistance agree in admitting that a nation is justified in

defending its own existence or independence that this is even a

moral duty as it is a fundamental right of a state many especially

the older writers make the confident assertion that all wars of

defence are just but will this serve as a standard gibbon tells

us somewhere that livy asserts that the romans conquered the world

in selfdefence the distinction between wars of aggression and

defence is one very difficult to draw the cause of a nation which

waits to be actually attacked is often lost the critical moment

in its defence may be past the essence of a states defensive

power may lie in a readiness to strike the first blow or its whole

interests may be bound up in the necessity of fighting the matter

out in itsp 85 enemys

country rather than at home it is not in the strictly military

interpretation of the term defensive but in its wider ethical

and political sense that we can speak of wars of defence as just

but indeed we cannot judge these questions abstractly where a

war is necessary it matters very little whether it is just or not

only the judgment of history can finally decide and generally it

seems at the time that both parties have something of right on

their side something perhaps too of wrong93 p 86 a consideration

of difficulties like these brings us to a realisation of the fact

that the chances are small that a nation in the heat of a dispute

will admit the likelihood of its being in the wrong to refuse

to admit this is generally tantamount to a refusal to submit the

difficulty to arbitration and neither international law nor the

moral force of public opinion can induce a state to act contrary to

what it believes to be its own interest moreover as international

law now stands it is not a duty to have recourse to arbitration

this was made quite clear in the proceedings of the peace conference

at the hague in 189994 it was strongly recommended that

arbitration should be sought wherever it was possible but at the

same time definitely stated that this course could in no case

be compulsory in this respect things have not advanced beyond

the position of the paris congress of 185695 the wars waged in

europe subsequent to that date have all been begun without previous

attempt at mediation
but the work of the peace party regarding thep 87 humaner methods of

settlement is not to be neglected the popular feeling which they

have been partly the means of stimulating has no doubt done something

to influence the action of statesmen towards extreme caution in

the treatment of questions likely to arouse national passions and

prejudices arbitration has undoubtedly made headway in recent

years britain and america the two nations whose names naturally

suggest themselves to us as future centres of federative union both

countries whose industrial interests are numerous and complicated

have most readily as they have most frequently settled disputes

in this practical manner it has shown itself to be a policy as

economical as it is businesslike its value in its proper place

cannot be overrated by any peace congress or by any peace pamphlet

but we have endeavoured to make it clear that this sphere is but a

limited one the goodwill may not be there when it ought perhaps

to appear it will certainly not be there when any vital interest

is at stake but even if this were not so and arbitration were

the natural sequence of every dispute no coercive force exists

to enforce the decree of the court the moral restraint of public

opinion is here a poor substitute treaties it is often said are in

the same position but treaties have been broken and will no doubt

be broken again wep 88

are moved to the conclusion that a thoroughly logical peace programme

cannot stop short of the principle of federation federal troops are

necessary to carry out the decrees of a tribunal of arbitration if

that court is not to run a risk of being held feeble and ineffectual

except on some such basis arbitration as a substitute for war

stands on but a weak footing
disarmament
the efforts of the peace society are directed with even less hope

of complete success against another evil of our time the crushing

burden of modern armaments we have peace at this moment but at

a daily increasing cost the peace society is rightly concerned

in pressing this point it is not enough to keep off actual war

there is a limit to the price we can afford to pay even for peace

probably no principle has cost europe so much in the last century

as that handed down from romesi vis pacem para bellum it is

now a hundred and fifty years since montesquieu96 protestedp 89 against this new

distemper which was spreading itself over europe but never in

time of peace has complaint been so loud or so general as now

and this not only against the universal burden of taxation which

weighs upon all nations alike but in continental countries

against the waste of productive force due to compulsory military

service a discontent which seems to strike at the very foundations

of society vattel relates that in early times a treaty of peace

generally stipulated that both parties should afterwards disarm and

there is no doubt that kant was right in regarding standing armies

as a danger to peace not only as openly expressing the rivalry and

distrust between nation and nation which hobbes regards as the basis

of international relations but also as putting a power into the

hand of a nation which it may some day have the temptation to abuse

a warloving overbearing spirit in a people thrives none the worse

for a consciousness that its army or navy can hold its own with any

other in europe were it not the case that the essence of armed peace

is that a high state of efficiency should bep 90 general the danger to peace would be

very great indeed no doubt it is due to this fact that france has

kept quietly to her side of the rhine during the last thirty years

the annexation of alsacelorraine was an immediate stimulus to the

increase of armaments but otherwise just because of this greater

efficiency and the slightly stronger military position of germany it

has been an influence on the side of peace
the czars rescript of 1898 gave a new stimulus to an interest

in this question which the subsequent conference at the hague was

unable fully to satisfy we are compelled to consider carefully

how a process of simultaneous disarmament can actually be carried

out and what results might be anticipated from this step with a

view not only to the present but the future can this be done in

accordance with the principles of justice organisations like a

great navy or a highly disciplined army have been built up in the

course of centuries at great cost and at much sacrifice to the

nation they are the fruit of years of wise government and a high

record of national industry are such visible tokens of the culture

and character and worth of a people to be swept away and britain

france germany italy spain turkey to stand on the same level

and even if no such ethical considerations should arise on what

method arep 91 we to

proceed the standard as well as the nature of armament depends

in every state on its geographical conditions and its historical

position an oceanbound empire like britain is comparatively immune

from the danger of invasion her army can be safely despatched to

the colonies her fleet protects her at home her position is one of

natural defence but germany and austria find themselves in exactly

opposite circumstances with the hard necessity imposed upon them of

guarding their frontiers on every side the safety of a nation like

germany is in the hands of its army its military strength lies in an

almost perfect mastery of the science of attack
the peace society has hitherto made no attempt to face the

difficulties inseparable from any attempt to apply a uniform method

of treatment to peculiarities and conditions so conflicting and

various as these those who have been more conscientious have not

been very successful in solving them indeed so constantly is

military technique changing that it is difficult to prophesy wherein

will lie a few years hence the essence of a states defensive

power or what part the modern navy will play in this defence no

careful thinker would suggest in the face of dangers threatening

from thep 92 east97 a

complete disarmament the simplest of many suggestions madebut

this on the basis of universal conscriptionseems to be that the

number of years or months of compulsory military service should

be reduced to some fixed period but this does not touch the

difficulty of colonial empires98 like britain which might to a certain

extent disarm like their neighbours in europe but would be

compelled to keep an army for the defence of their colonies

elsewhere it is in the meantime inevitable that europe should keep

up a high standard of armamentthis is and even if we had european

federation would remain an absolute necessity as a protection

against the yellow races and in europe itself there are at present

elements hostile to the cause of peace alsacelorraine polish

prussia russian poland and finland are still to a considerable

degree sources of discontent and dissatisfaction but in russia

itself lies the great obstacle to a future european peace or

european federation we can scarcely picture russia as a reliable

member of such a union that russia should disarm is scarcelyp 93 feasible in view of its

own interest it has always to face the danger of rebellion in poland

and anarchy at home but that europe should disarm before russia has

attained a higher civilisation a consciousness of its great future

as a northeastern interoceanic empire and a government more

favourable to the diffusion of liberty is still less practicable99 we

have here to fall back upon federation again it is not impossible

that in the course of time this problem may be solved and that

the contribution to the federal troops of a european union may be

regulated upon some equitable basis the form of which we cannot now

well prophesy
european federation would likewise meet all difficulties where a

risk might be likely to occur of one nation intervening to protect

another as we have said above p 64

note nations are nowadays slow to intervene in the interests

of humanity they are in general constrained to do so only by strong

motives of selfinterest and when these are not at hand they are

said to refrain from respect for anothers right of independent

action actually a state which is actuated by less selfish impulses

is apt to lose considerably more than itp 94 gains and the feeling of the people

expresses itself strongly against any quixotic or sentimental policy

it is not impossible that the powers may have yet to intervene to

protect turkey against russia such a step might well be dictated

purely by a proper care for the security of europe but wars of this

kind seem not likely to play an important part in the near future
we have said that the causes of difference which may be expected

to disturb the peace of europe are now fewer a modern sovereign

no longer spends his leisure time in the excitement of slaying or

seeing slain he could not if he would his honour and his vanity

are protected by other means they play no longer an important part

in the affairs of nations the causes of war can no more be either

trifling or personal some crises there are which are ever likely to

be fatal to peace there present themselves in the lives of nations

ideal ends for which everything must be sacrificed there are rights

which must at all cost be defended the question of civil war we

may neglect liberty and wise government are the only medicine for

social discontent and much may be hoped from that in the future

but now looking beyond the state to the great family of civilised

nations we may say that the one certain cause of war between them

or of rebellion within a future federated union will be ap 95 menace to the sovereign

rights the independence and existence of any member of that

federation other causes of quarrel offer a more hopeful prospect

some questions have been seen to be specially fitted for the legal

procedure of a tribunal of arbitration others to be such as a

federal court would quickly settle the preservation of the balance

of power which frederick the great regarded as the talisman of peace

in europea judgment surely not borne out by experienceis happily

one of the causes of war which are of the past wars of colonisation

such as would be an attempt on the part of russia to conquer india

seem scarcely likely to recur except between higher and lower races

the cost is nowadays too great political wars wars for national

union and unity of which there were so many during the past century

seem at present not to be near at hand and the integration of

european nationswhat may be called the great mission of waris for

the moment practically complete for it is highly improbable that

either alsacelorraine or polandstill less finlandwill be the cause

of a war of this kind
our hope lies in a federated europe its troops would serve to

preserve law and order in the country from which they were drawn and

to protect its colonies abroad but their higher function wouldp 96 be to keep peace in

europe to protect the weaker members of the federation and to

enforce the decision of the majority either if necessary by actual

war or by the mere threatening demonstrations of fleets such as

have before proved effectual
we have carefully considered what has been attempted by peace

workers and we have now to take note that all the results of the

last fifty years are not to be attributed to their conscientious

but often illdirected labour the diminution of the causes of war

is to be traced less to the efforts of the peace society except

indirectly in so far as they have influenced the minds of the

masses than to the increasing power of the people themselves

the various classes of society are opposed to violent methods of

settlement not in the main from a conviction as to the wrongfulness

of war or from any fanatical enthusiasm for a brotherhood of

nations but from selfinterest war is death to the industrial

interests of a nation it is vain to talk in the language of past

centuries of trade between civilised countries being advanced and

markets opened up or enlarged by this means100p 97 kings give up the dream of military glory

and accept instead the certainty of peaceful labour and industrial

progress and all this for we may believe that to some monarchs it

is much from no enthusiastic appreciation of the efforts of peace

societies from no careful examination of the new testament nor

inspired interpretation of its teaching it is selfinterest the

prosperity of the countrypatriotism if you willthat seems better

than war
what may be expected from federation
federation and federation alone can help out the programme of the

peace society it cannot be pretended that it will do everything

to state the worst at once it will not prevent war even the

federations of the states of germany and america bound together by

ties of blood and language and in the latter case of sentiment

were not strong enough within to keep out dissension and disunion101

wars would not cease but they would become much less frequent

why is there no longer war between england and scotland why did

prussian and hanoverian fight side by side in 1870 though they had

foughtp 98 against

each other only four years before if we wish to know how war is

to cease we should ask ourselves how it has ceased professor

d g ritchie op cit p 169 wars between different grades

of civilisation are bound to exist as long as civilisation itself

exists the history of culture and of progress has been more or less

a history of war a calm acceptance of this position may mean to

certain shortsighted enthusiastic theorists an impossible sacrifice

of the ideal but the sacrifice once made we stand on a better

footing with regard to at least one class of arguments against a

federation of the world such a union will lead it is said to an

equality in culture a sameness of interests fatal to progress

all struggle and conflict will be cast out of the state itself

national characteristics and individuality will be obliterated

the lamb and the wolf will lie down together stagnation will

result intellectual progress will be at an end politics will be

no more history will stand still this is a sweeping assertion an

alarming prophecy but a little thought will assure us that there

is small cause for apprehension there can be no such standstill

no millennium in human affairs a gradual smoothing down of sharply

accentuated national characteristics there might be this is a result

which a freer more friendly intercourse between nations would be

veryp 99 likely to

produce but conflicting interests keen rivalry in their pursuit

difference of culture and natural aptitude and all or much of

the individuality which language and literature historical and

religious traditions even climatic and physical conditions produce

are bound to survive until the coming of some more overwhelming and

farspreading revolution than this it would not be well if it were

otherwise if those unconscious and invisible peculiarities in

which fichte sees the hand of god and the guarantee of a nations

future dignity virtue and merit should be swept away reden an

die deutsche nation102 1807 nor is stagnation to be feared

strife said the old philosopher is the father of all things

there can be no lasting peace in the processes of nature and

existence it has been in the constant rivalry between classes within

themselves and in the struggle for existence with other races that

great nations have reached the highwater mark of their development

a perpetual peace in international relations we maynay surely

willone day have but eternity will not see the end to the feverish

unrest within the state and the jealous competition and distrust

between individuals groups and classes of society here there must

ever be perpetual war
it was only of this political peace between civilp 100ised nations

that kant thought103 in this form it is bound to come the

federation of europe will follow the federation of germany and

of italy not only because it offers a solution of many problems

which have long taxed europe but because great men and careful

thinkers believe in it104 it may not come quickly but such men can

afford to wait if i were legislator cried jean jacques rousseau

i should not say what ought to be done but i would do it this is

the attitude of the unthinking unpractical enthusiast the wish is

not enough the will is not enough the mills of god must take their

own time no hope or faith of ours no struggle or labour even can

hurry them
it is a misfortune that the peace society has identified

itself with so narrow and uncritical an attitude towards war

and that the copious elop

101quence of its members is not based upon a consideration

of the practical difficulties of the case this wellmeaning hard

working and enthusiastic body would like to do what is impossible

by an impossible method the end which it sets for itself is an

unattainable one but this need not be so to make unjustifiable

aggression difficult to banish unworthy pretexts for making war

might be a high enough ideal for any enthusiasm and offer scope wide

enough for the labours of any society but the peace society has not

contented itself with this great work through its overestimation

of the value of peace105 its cause has been injured and much of

its influence has been weakened or lost our age is one which sets

a high value upon human life and to this change of thinking may be

traced our modern reform in the methods of war and all that has been

done for the alleviation of suffering by the great conventions of

recent years for the eyes of most people war is merely a hideous

spectacle of bloodshed and deliberate destruction of life this is

its obvious side but it is possible to exaggerate this confessedly

great evil peace has its sacrifices as well as war thep 102 progress of humanity

requires that the individual should often be put aside for the sake

of lasting advantage to the whole an opposite view can only be

reckoned individualistic perhaps materialistic the reverence for

human life says martineau studies of christianity pp 352

354 is carried to an immoral idolatry when it is held more sacred

than justice and right and when the spectacle of blood becomes

more horrible than the sight of desolating tyrannies and triumphant

hypocrisies we have therefore no more doubt that a war may be

right than that a policeman may be a security for justice and we

object to a fortress as little as to a handcuff
the peace society are not of this opinion they greatly doubt that

a war may be right and they rarely fail to take their doubts to the

tribunal of scripture their efforts are well meant this piety may

be genuine enough but a text is rarely a proof of anything and in

any case serves one man in as good stead as another we remember that

the devil can cite scripture for his purpose this unscientific

method of proof or persuasion has ever been widely popular it is

a serious examination of the question that we want a more careful

study of its actual history and of the possibilities of human nature

less vague exaggerated language about what ought to be done and a

realisation ofp 103

what has been actually achieved above all a clear perception of

what may fairly be asked from the future
it used to be saidis perhaps asserted still by the

warloversthat there was no path to civilisation which had not

been beaten by the force of arms no height to which the sword

had not led the way the inspiration of war was upon the great

arts of civilisation its hand was upon the greatest of the

sciences these obligations extended even to commerce war not

only created new branches of industry it opened new markets and

enlarged the old these are great claims according to which

war might be called the moving principle of history if we keep

our eyes fixed upon the history of the past they seem not only

plausible they are in a great sense true progress did tread at

the heels of the great alexanders army the advance of european

culture stands in the closest connection with the crusades but

was this happy compensation for a miserable state of affairs not

due to the peculiarly unsocial conditions of early times and the

absence of every facility for the interchange of ideas or material

advantages it is inconceivable that nowadays106 any aid to the

development of thought in europe should come from war thep 104 old adage in more than

a literal sense has but too often been proved trueinter arma

musae silent peace is for us the real promoter of culture
we have to endeavour to take an intermediate course between

uncritical praise and wholesale condemnation between extravagant

expectation and unjustifiable pessimism war used to be the rule it

is now an overwhelming and terrible exceptionan interruption to the

peaceful prosperous course of things inflicting unlimited suffering

and temporary or lasting loss its evils are on the surface apparent

to the most unthinking observer the day may yet dawn when europeans

will have learned to regard the force of arms as an instrument for

the civilisation of savage or halfsavage races and war within

their continent as civil war necessary and justifiable sometimes

perhaps but still a blot upon their civilisation and brotherhood

as men such a suggestion rings strangely but the great changes

which the roll of centuries has marked once came upon the world not

less unexpectedly how far off must the idea of a civil peace have

seemed to small towns and states of europe in the fifteenth century

how strange only a centuryp

105 ago would the idea of applying steam power or electrical

force have seemed to ourselves let us not despair war has played a

great part in the history of the world it has been ever the great

architect of nations the true mother of cities it has justified

itself today in the union of kindred peoples the making of great

empires it may be that one decisive war may yet be required to unite

europe may europe survive that struggle and go forward fearlessly to

her great future a peaceful future that may not be it must never

be forgotten that war is sometimes a moral duty that it is ever the

natural sequence of human passion and human prejudice an unbroken

peace we cannot and do not expect but it is this that we must work

for as kant says we must keep it before us as an ideal


p 106
translation107
perpetual peace108

we need not try to decide whether this

satirical inscription once found on a dutch innkeepers signboard

above the picture of a churchyard is aimed at mankind in general or

at the rulers of states in particular unwearying in their love of

war or perhaps only at the philosophers who cherish the sweet dream

of perpetual peace the author of the present sketch would make one

stipulation however the practical politician stands upon a definite

footing with the theorist with great selfcomplacency he looks down

upon him as a mere pedant whose empty ideas can threaten no danger

to the state starting as it does from principles derived from

experience and who may always be permitted top 107 knock down his eleven skittles at once

without a worldlywise statesman needing to disturb himself hence

in the event of a quarrel arising between the two the practical

statesman must always act consistently and not scent danger to the

state behind opinions ventured by the theoretical politician at

random and publicly expressed with which saving clause clausula

salvatoria the author will herewith consider himself duly and

expressly protected against all malicious misinterpretation
 first section
containing the preliminary articles of perpetual

peace between states
1no treaty of peace shall be regarded as

valid if made with the secret reservation of material

for a future war
for then it would be a mere truce a mere suspension

of hostilities not peace a peace signifies the end of all

hostilities and to attach to it the epithet eternal is not

only a verbal pleonasm but matter of suspicion the causes of a

future war existing although perhaps not yet known to the high

contracting parties themselves are entirelyp 108 annihilated by the conclusion of

peace however acutely they may be ferreted out of documents in the

public archives there may be a mental reservation of old claims to

be thought out at a future time which are none of them mentioned

at this stage because both parties are too much exhausted to

continue the war while the evil intention remains of using the

first favourable opportunity for further hostilities diplomacy

of this kind only jesuitical casuistry can justify it is beneath

the dignity of a ruler just as acquiescence in such processes of

reasoning is beneath the dignity of his minister if one judges the

facts as they really are109
if however according to present enlightened ideas of political

wisdom the true glory of a state lies in the uninterrupted

development of its power by every possible means this judgment must

certainly strike one as scholastic and pedantic
2no state having an independent existencewhether

it be great or smallshall be acquired by another through

inheritance exchange purchase or donation110 p 109
for a state is not a property patrimonium as may

be the ground on which its people are settled it is a society of

human beings over whom no one but itself has the right to rule and

to dispose like the trunk of a tree it has its own roots and to

graft it on to another state is to do away with its existence as a

moral person and to make of it a thing hence it is in contradiction

to the idea of the original contract without which no right over

a people is thinkable111 everyone knows to what danger the bias in

favour of these modes of acquisition has brought europe in other

parts of the world it has never been known the custom of marriage

between states as if they were individuals has survived even up

to the most recent times112 and is regarded partly as a new kind

of industry by which ascendency may be acquired through family

alliances without any expenditure of strength partlyp 110 as a device for

territorial expansion moreover the hiring out of the troops of one

state to another to fight against an enemy not at war with their

native country is to be reckoned in this connection for the subjects

are in this way used and abused at will as personal property
3standing armies miles perpetuus shall be

abolished in course of time
for they are always threatening other states with

war by appearing to be in constant readiness to fight they incite

the various states to outrival one another in the number of their

soldiers and to this number no limit can be set now since owing

to the sums devoted to this purpose peace at last becomes even more

oppressive than a short war these standing armies are themselves the

cause of wars of aggression undertaken in order to get rid of this

burden to which we must add that the practice of hiring men to kill

or to be killed seems to imply a use of them as mere machines and

instruments in the hand of another namely the state which cannot

easily be reconciled with the right of humanity in our own person113

thep 111 matter stands

quite differently in the case of voluntary periodical military

exercise on the part of citizens of the state who thereby seek to

secure themselves and their country against attack from without
the accumulation of treasure in a state would in the same way be

regarded by other states as a menace of war and might compel them to

anticipate this by striking the first blow for of the three forces

the power of arms the power of alliance and the power of money the

last might well become the most reliable instrument of war did not

the difficulty of ascertaining the amount stand in the way
4no national debts shall be contracted in connection

with the external affairs of the state
this source of help is above suspicion where

assistance is sought outside or within the state on behalf of the

economic administration of the country for instance the improvement

of the roads the settlement and support of new colonies the

establishment of granaries to provide against seasons of scarcity

and so on but as a common weapon used by the powers against

one another a credit system under which debts go on indefinitely

inp 112creasing and

are yet always assured against immediate claims because all the

creditors do not put in their claim at once is a dangerous money

power this ingenious invention of a commercial people in the

present century is in other words a treasure for the carrying on

of war which may exceed the treasures of all the other states taken

together and can only be exhausted by a threatening deficiency in

the taxesan event however which will long be kept off by the very

briskness of commerce resulting from the reaction of this system on

industry and trade the ease then with which war may be waged

coupled with the inclination of rulers towards itan inclination

which seems to be implanted in human natureis a great obstacle in

the way of perpetual peace the prohibition of this system must be

laid down as a preliminary article of perpetual peace all the more

necessarily because the final inevitable bankruptcy of the state in

question must involve in the loss many who are innocent and this

would be a public injury to these states therefore other nations are

at least justified in uniting themselves against such an one and its

pretensions
5no state shall violently interfere with the

constitution and administration of another
p 113for

what can justify it in so doing the scandal which is here presented

to the subjects of another state the erring state can much more

serve as a warning by exemplifying the great evils which a nation

draws down on itself through its own lawlessness moreover the

bad example which one free person gives another as scandalum

acceptum does no injury to the latter in this connection it is

true we cannot count the case of a state which has become split up

through internal corruption into two parts each of them representing

by itself an individual state which lays claim to the whole here

the yielding of assistance to one faction could not be reckoned as

interference on the part of a foreign state with the constitution of

another for here anarchy prevails so long however as the inner

strife has not yet reached this stage the interference of other

powers would be a violation of the rights of an independent nation

which is only struggling with internal disease114 it wouldp 114 therefore itself cause

a scandal and make the autonomy of all states insecure
6no state at war with another shall countenance

such modes of hostility as would make mutual confidence impossible

in a subsequent state of peace such are the employment of

assassins percussores or of poisoners venefici breaches

of capitulation the instigating and making use of treachery

perduellio in the hostile state
these are dishonourable stratagems for some kind

of confidence in the disposition of the enemy must exist even in

the midst of war as otherwise peace could not be concluded and

the hostilities would pass into a war of extermination bellum

internecinum war however is only our wretched expedient of

asserting a right by force an expedient adopted in the state of

nature where no court of justice exists which could settle the

matter in dispute in circumstances like these neither of the two

parties can be called an unjust enemy because this form of speech

presupposes a legal decision the issue of the conflictjust as in

thep 115 case of the

socalled judgments of goddecides on which side right is between

states however no punitive war bellum punitivum is thinkable

because between them a relation of superior and inferior does not

exist whence it follows that a war of extermination where the

process of annihilation would strike both parties at once and all

right as well would bring about perpetual peace only in the great

graveyard of the human race such a war then and therefore also the

use of all means which lead to it must be absolutely forbidden

that the methods just mentioned do inevitably lead to this result

is obvious from the fact that these infernal arts already vile in

themselves on coming into use are not long confined to the sphere

of war take for example the use of spies uti exploratoribus

here only the dishonesty of others is made use of but vices such

as these when once encouraged cannot in the nature of things be

stamped out and would be carried over into the state of peace where

their presence would be utterly destructive to the purpose of that

state
although the laws stated are objectively regarded ie in

so far as they affect the action of rulers purely prohibitive laws

leges prohibitiv some of them leges strict are strictly

valid without regard to circumstances and urgently require to be

enforced such are nos 1 5 6 others again like nos 2p 116 3 4 although not

indeed exceptions to the maxims of law yet in respect of the

practical application of these maxims allow subjectively of a certain

latitude to suit particular circumstances the enforcement of these

leges lat may be legitimately put off so long as we do not lose

sight of the ends at which they aim this purpose of reform does not

permit of the deferment of an act of restitution as for example

the restoration to certain states of freedom of which they have been

deprived in the manner described in article 2 to an infinitely

distant dateas augustus used to say to the greek kalends a day

that will never come this would be to sanction nonrestitution

delay is permitted only with the intention that restitution should

not be made too precipitately and so defeat the purpose we have

in view for the prohibition refers here only to the mode of

acquisition which is to be no longer valid and not to the fact of

possession which although indeed it has not the necessary title

of right yet at the time of socalled acquisition was held legal

by all states in accordance with the public opinion of the time115
 p 117second section
containing the definitive articles of a perpetual

peace between states
a state of peace among men who live side by side is not the

natural state status naturalis whichp 118 is rather to be described as

a state of war116 that is to say although there is not

perhaps always actual open hostility yet there is a constant

threatening that an outbreak may occur thus the state of peace

must be established117 for the merep 119 cessation of hostilities is no

guarantee of continued peaceful relations and unless this guarantee

is given by every individual to his neighbourwhich can only be

done in a state of society regulated by lawone man is at liberty

to challenge another and treat him as an enemy118
p

120first definitive article of perpetual

peace
ithe civil constitution of each state shall be

republican
the only constitution which has its origin in the

idea of the original contract upon which the lawful legislation of

every nation must be based is the republican119 it is a constitution

in the first placep

121 founded in accordance with the principle of the freedom

of the members of society as human beings secondly in accordance

with the principle of the dependence of all as subjects on a common

legislation and thirdly in accordance with the law of the equality

of the members as citizens it is then looking at the question of

right the only constitution whose fundamental principles lie at the

basis of every form of civil constitution and the only question for

us now is whether it is also the one constitution which can lead to

perpetual peace
now the republican constitution apart from the soundness

of its origin since it arose from thep 122 pure source of the concept of right

has also the prospect of attaining the desired result namely

perpetual peace and the reason is this if as must be so under this

constitution the consent of the subjects is required to determine

whether there shall be war or not nothing is more natural than that

they should weigh the matter well before undertaking such a bad

business for in decreeing war they would of necessity be resolving

to bring down the miseries of war upon their country this implies

they must fight themselves they must hand over the costs of the war

out of their ownp 123

property they must do their poor best to make good the devastation

which it leaves behind and finally as a crowning ill they have

to accept a burden of debt which will embitter even peace itself

and which they can never pay off on account of the new wars which

are always impending on the other hand in a government where the

subject is not a citizen holding a vote ie in a constitution

which is not republican the plunging into war is the least serious

thing in the world for the ruler is not a citizen but the owner

of the state and does not lose a whit by the war while he goes

on enjoying the delights of his table or sport or of his pleasure

palaces and gala days he can therefore decide on war for the

most trifling reasons as if it were a kind of pleasure party120 any

justification of it that is necessary for the sake of decency he can

leave without concern to the diplomatic corps who are always only too

ready with their services
p 124      
the following remarks must be made in order that we may not fall

into the common error of confusing the republican with the democratic

constitution the forms of the state civitas121 may be classified

according to either of two principles of divisionthe difference

of the persons who hold the supreme authority in the state and the

manner in which the people are governed by their ruler whoever he

may be the first is properly called the form of sovereignty forma

imperii and there can be only three constitutions differing

in this respect where namely the supreme authority belongs to

only one to several individuals working together or to the whole

people constituting the civil society thus we have autocracy

or the sovereignty of a monarch aristocracy or the sovereignty

of the nobility and democracy or thep 125 sovereignty of the people the

second principle of division is the form of government forma

regiminis and refers to the way in which the state makes use of

its supreme power for the manner of government is based on the

constitution itself the act of that universal will which transforms

a multitude into a nation in this respect the form of government

is either republican or despotic republicanism is the political

principle of severing the executive power of the government from the

legislature despotism is that principle in pursuance of which the

state arbitrarily puts into effect laws which it has itself made

consequently it is the administration of the public will but this is

identical with the private will of the ruler of these three forms of

a state democracy in the proper sense of the word is of necessity

despotism because it establishes an executive power since all

decree regardingand if need be againstany individual who dissents

from them therefore the whole people socalled who carry their

measure are really not all but only a majority so that here the

universal will is in contradiction with itself and with the principle

of freedom
every form of government in fact which is not representative

is really no true constitution at all because a lawgiver may

no more be in one and the same person the administrator of his

ownp 126 will than

the universal major premise of a syllogism may be at the same time

the subsumption under itself of the particulars contained in the

minor premise and although the other two constitutions autocracy

and aristocracy are always defective in so far as they leave the

way open for such a form of government yet there is at least

always a possibility in these cases that they may take the form

of a government in accordance with the spirit of a representative

system thus frederick the great used at least to say that he

was merely the highest servant of the state122 the democratic

constitution on the other hand makes this impossible because

under such a government every one wishes to be master we may

therefore say that the smaller the staff of the executivethat

is to say the number of rulersand the more real on the other

hand their representation of the people so much the more is the

government of the state inp

127 accordance with a possible republicanism and it may

hope by gradual reforms to raise itself to that standard for this

reason it is more difficult under an aristocracy than under a

monarchywhile under a democracy it is impossible except by a violent

revolutionto attain to this the one perfectly lawful constitution

the kind of government123 however is of infinitely more importance

to the people than the kind of constitution although the greater or

less aptitude of a people for this ideal greatly depends upon such

external form the form of government however if it is to be in

accordance with the idea of right must embody the representative

system in which alone a republican form of administration is

posp 128sible and

without which it is despotic and violent be the constitution what

it may none of the ancient socalled republics were aware of

this and they necessarily slipped into absolute despotism which

of all despotisms is most endurable under the sovereignty of one

individual
second definitive article of perpetual

peace
iithe law of nations shall be founded on a

federation of free states
nations as states may be judged like individuals who

living in the natural state of societythat is to say uncontrolled

by external lawinjure one another through their very proximity124

every state for the sake of its own security mayand ought

todemand that its neighbour should submit itself to conditions

similar to those of the civil society where the right of every

individual is guaranteedp

129 this would give rise to a federation of nations which

however would not have to be a state of nations125 that would involve

a contradiction for the term state implies the relation of one

who rules to those who obeythat is to say of lawgiver to the

subject people and many nations in one state would constitute only

one nation which contradicts our hypothesis since here we have to

consider the right of one nation against another in so far as they

are so many separate states and are not to be fused into one
p 130the attachment

of savages to their lawless liberty the fact that they would rather

be at hopeless variance with one another than submit themselves to a

legal authority constituted by themselves that they therefore prefer

their senseless freedom to a reasongoverned liberty is regarded by

us with profound contempt as barbarism and uncivilisation and the

brutal degradation of humanity so one would think that civilised

races each formed into a state by itself must come out of such an

abandoned condition as soon as they possibly can on the contrary

however every state thinks rather that its majesty the majesty

of a people is an absurd expression lies just in the very fact that

it is subject to no external legal authority and the glory of the

ruler consists in this that without his requiring to expose himself

to danger thousands stand at his command ready to let themselves be

sacrificed for a matter of no concern to them126 the difference

between the savages of europe and those of america lies chiefly

in this that while many tribes of the latter have been entirely

devoured by their enemies europeans know a better way of using the

vanquished than by eatingp

131 them and they prefer to increase through them the number

of their subjects and so the number of instruments at their command

for still more widely spread war
the depravity of human nature127 shows itself without

disguise in the unrestrained relations of nations to each other

while in the lawgoverned civil state much of this is hidden by

the check of government this being so it is astonishing that the

word right has not yet been entirely banished from the politics

of war as pedantic and that no state has yet ventured to publicly

advocate this point of view for hugo grotius puffendorf vattel

and othersjobs comforters all of themare always quoted in good

faith to justify an attack although their codes whether couched

in philosophical or diplomatic terms have notnor can havethe

slightest legal force because states as such are under no common

external authority and there is no instance of a state having

everp 132 been moved

by argument to desist from its purpose even when this was backed

up by the testimony of such great men this homage which every

state rendersin words at leastto the idea of right proves that

although it may be slumbering there is notwithstanding to be found

in man a still higher natural moral capacity by the aid of which

he will in time gain the mastery over the evil principle in his

nature the existence of which he is unable to deny and he hopes

the same of others for otherwise the word right would never be

uttered by states who wish to wage war unless to deride it like

the gallic prince who declaredthe privilege which nature gives

the strong is that the weak must obey them128
the method by which states prosecute their rights can never be

by process of lawas it is where there is an external tribunalbut

only by war through this means however and its favourable issue

victory the question of right is never decided a treaty of peace

makes it may be an end to the war of the moment but not to the

conditionsp 133 of war

which at any time may afford a new pretext for opening hostilities

and this we cannot exactly condemn as unjust because under these

conditions everyone is his own judge notwithstanding not quite

the same rule applies to states according to the law of nations

as holds good of individuals in a lawless condition according to

the law of nature namely that they ought to advance out of this

condition this is so because as states they have already

within themselves a legal constitution and have therefore advanced

beyond the stage at which others in accordance with their ideas

of right can force them to come under a wider legal constitution

meanwhile however reason from her throne of the supreme

lawgiving moral power absolutely condemns war129 as a morally lawful

proceedingp 134

and makes a state of peace on the other hand an immediate duty

without a compact between the nations however this state of peace

cannot be established or assured hence there must be an alliance

of a particular kind which we may call a covenant of peace foedus

pacificum which would differ from a treaty of peace pactum

pacis in this respect that the latter merely puts an end to one

war while the former would seek to put an end to war for ever this

alliance does not aim at the gain of any power whatsoever of the

state but merely at the preservation and security of the freedom of

the state for itself and of other allied states at the same time130

the latter do not however require for this reason to submit

themselves like individuals in the state of nature to public laws

and coercion the practicability or objective reality of this idea

of federation which is to extend gradually over all states and so

lead to perpetual peace can be shewn for if fortune ordains that

a powerful and enlightened people should form a republicwhich by

its very nature is inclined to perpetual peacethis would serve as a

centre of federal union for other states wishing to join and thus

secure conditions of freedomp

135 among the states in accordance with the idea of the law

of nations gradually through different unions of this kind the

federation would extend further and further
it is quite comprehensible that a people should saythere

shall be no war among us for we shall form ourselves into a state

that is to say constitute for ourselves a supreme legislative

administrative and judicial power which will settle our disputes

peaceably but if this state saysthere shall be no war between me

and other states although i recognise no supreme lawgiving power

which will secure me my rights and whose rights i will guarantee

then it is not at all clear upon what grounds i could base my

confidence in my right unless it were the substitute for that

compact on which civil society is basednamely free federation which

reason must necessarily connect with the idea of the law of nations

if indeed any meaning is to be left in that concept at all
there is no intelligible meaning in the idea of the law of

nations as giving a right to make war for that must be a right to

decide what is just not in accordance with universal external

laws limiting the freedom of each individual but by means of

onesided maxims applied by force we must then understand by

this that men of such ways of thinking are quite justly served

when theyp 136

destroy one another and thus find perpetual peace in the wide

grave which covers all the abominations of acts of violence as

well as the authors of such deeds for states in their relation

to one another there can be according to reason no other way of

advancing from that lawless condition which unceasing war implies

than by giving up their savage lawless freedom just as individual

men have done and yielding to the coercion of public laws thus

they can form a state of nations civitas gentium one too

which will be ever increasing and would finally embrace all the

peoples of the earth states however in accordance with their

understanding of the law of nations by no means desire this and

therefore reject in hypothesi what is correct in thesi hence

instead of the positive idea of a worldrepublic if all is not

to be lost only the negative substitute for it a federation

averting war maintaining its ground and ever extending over the

world may stop the current of this tendency to war and shrinking

from the control of law but even then there will be a constant

danger that this propensity may break out131p 137 furor impius intusfremit horridus

third definitive article of perpetual

peace
iiithe rights of men as citizens of the world

shall be limited to the conditions of universal hospitality
we are speaking here as in the previous articles

not of philanthropy but of right and in this sphere hospitality

signifies the claim of a stranger entering foreign territory to be

treated by its owner without hostility the latter may send him

away again if this can be done without causing his death but so

long as he conducts himself peaceably he must not be treated as

an enemy it is not a right to be treated as a guest to which the

stranger can layp 138

claima special friendly compact on his behalf would be required

to make him for a given time an actual inmatebut he has a right

of visitation this right133 to present themselves to society belongs

to all mankind in virtue of our common right of possession on

the surface of the earth on which as it is a globe we cannot

be infinitely scattered and must in the end reconcile ourselves

to existence side by side at the same time originally no one

individual had more right than another to live in any one particular

spot uninhabitable portions of the surface ocean and desert

split up the human community but in such a way that ships and

camelsthe ship of the desertmake it possible for men to come

into touch with one another across these unappropriated regions

and to take advantage of our common claim to the face of the earth

with a view to a possible intercommunication the inhospitality of

the inhabitants of certain sea coastsas for example the coast of

barbaryin plundering ships in neighbouring seas or making slaves

of shipwrecked mariners or the behaviour of the arab bedouins in

the deserts who think thatp

139 proximity to nomadic tribes constitutes a right to rob

is thus contrary to the law of nature this right to hospitality

howeverthat is to say the privilege of strangers arriving on

foreign soildoes not amount to more than what is implied in a

permission to make an attempt at intercourse with the original

inhabitants in this way far distant territories may enter into

peaceful relations with one another these relations may at last

come under the public control of law and thus the human race may be

brought nearer the realisation of a cosmopolitan constitution
let us look now for the sake of comparison at the inhospitable

behaviour of the civilised nations especially the commercial

states of our continent the injustice which they exhibit on

visiting foreign lands and racesthis being equivalent in their

eyes to conquestis such as to fill us with horror america the

negro countries the spice islands the cape etc were on being

discovered looked upon as countries which belonged to nobody for

the native inhabitants were reckoned as nothing in hindustan under

the pretext of intending to establish merely commercial depots the

europeans introduced foreign troops and as a result the different

states of hindustan were stirred up to farspreading wars oppression

of the natives followed famine insurrection perfidy and allp 140 the rest of the litany

of evils which can afflict mankind
china134 and japan nipon which had made

an attempt at receiving guests of this kind have nowp 141 taken a prudent step

only to a single european people the dutch has china given the

right of access to her shores but not of entrance into the country

while japan has granted both these concessions but at the same

time they exclude the dutch who enter as if they were prisoners

from social intercourse with the inhabitants the worst or from

the standpoint of ethical judgment the best of all this is that

no satisfaction is derived from all this violence that all these

trading companies stand on the verge of ruin that the sugar islands

that seat of the most horrible and delibp 142erate slavery yield no real profit

but only have their use indirectly and for no very praiseworthy

objectnamely that of furnishing men to be trained as sailors for

the menofwar and thereby contributing to the carrying on of war in

europe and this has been done by nations who make a great ado about

their piety and who while they are quite ready to commit injustice

would like in their orthodoxy to be considered among the elect
the intercourse more or less close which has been everywhere

steadily increasing between the nations of the earth has now

extended so enormously that a violation of right in one part of the

world is felt all over it hence the idea of a cosmopolitan right

is no fantastical highflown notion of right but a complement of

the unwritten code of lawconstitutional as well as international

lawnecessary for the public rights of mankind in general and thus

for the realisation of perpetual peace for only by endeavouring

to fulfil the conditions laid down by this cosmopolitan law can we

flatter ourselves that we are gradually approaching that ideal


p 143
first supplement
concerning the guarantee of perpetual peace

this

guarantee is given by no less a power than the great artist nature

natura ddala rerum in whose mechanical course is clearly

exhibited a predetermined design to make harmony spring from human

discord even against the will of man now this design although

called fate when looked upon as the compelling force of a cause the

laws of whose operation are unknown to us is when considered as

the purpose manifested in the course of nature called providence135 as

the deepp 144lying

wisdom of a higher cause directing itself towards the ultimate

practical end of the human race and predetermining the course of

things with a view to its realisation this providence we dop 145 not it is true

perceive in the cunning contrivances kunstanstalten of nature

nor can we even conclude from the fact of their existence that it

is there but as in every relation between the form of things

and their final cause we can and must supply the thought of a

higher wisdom in order that we may be able to form an idea of the

possible existence of these products after the analogy of human

works of art kunsthandp

146lungen136 the representation to ourselves of

the relation and agreement of these formations of nature to the

moral purpose for which they were made and which reason directly

prescribes to us is an idea it is true which is in theory

superfluous but in practice it is dogmatic and its objective

reality is well established137 thus we see for example with regard to

the ideal pflichtbegriff of perpetual peace that it is our duty

to make use of the mechanism of nature for the realisation of that

end moreover in a case like this where we are interested merely in

the theory and not in the religious question the use of the word

nature is more appropriate than that of providence in view of

the limitations of human reason which in considering the relation

of effects to their causes must keep within the limits of possible

experience and the term nature is also less presumptuous than the

other to speak of a providence knowable by us would be boldly to put

on the wings of icarus in order to draw near to the mystery of its

unfathomable purpose
before we determine the surety given by nature more exactly we

must first look at what ultimately makes this guarantee of peace

necessarythep 147

circumstances in which nature has carefully placed the actors in her

great theatre in the next place we shall proceed to consider the

manner in which she gives this surety
the provisions she has made are as follow 1 she has taken

care that men can live in all parts of the world 2 she has

scattered them by means of war in all directions even into the most

inhospitable regions so that these too might be populated 3 by

this very means she has forced them to enter into relations more or

less controlled by law it is surely wonderful that on the cold

wastes round the arctic ocean there is always to be found moss

for the reindeer to scrape out from under the snow the reindeer

itself either serving as food or to draw the sledge of the ostiak or

samoyedes and salt deserts which would otherwise be left unutilised

have the camel which seems as if created for travelling in such

lands this evidence of design in things however is still more

clear when we come to know that besides the furclad animals of the

shores of the arctic ocean there are seals walruses and whales

whose flesh furnishes food and whose oil fire for the dwellers in

these regions but the providential care of nature excites our wonder

above all when we hear of the driftwood which is carriedwhence

no one knowsto these treeless shores for without thep 148 aid of this material

the natives could neither construct their craft nor weapons nor

huts for shelter here too they have so much to do making war

against wild animals that they live at peace with one another but

what drove them originally into these regions was probably nothing

but war
of animals used by us as instruments of war the horse was the

first which man learned to tame and domesticate during the period of

the peopling of the earth the elephant belongs to the later period

of the luxury of states already established in the same way the art

of cultivating certain grasses called cerealsno longer known to us

in their original formand also the multiplication and improvement

by transplanting and grafting of the original kinds of fruitin

europe probably only two species the crabapple and wild pearcould

only originate under the conditions accompanying established states

where the rights of property are assured that is to say it would be

after man hitherto existing in lawless liberty had advanced beyond

the occupations of a hunter138 a fishermanp 149 or a shepherd to the life of a tiller

of the soil when salt and iron were discoveredto become perhaps

the first articles of commerce between different peoplesand were

sought far and near in this way the peoples would be at first

brought into peaceful relation with one another and so come to an

understanding and the enjoyment of friendly intercourse even with

their most distant neighbours
now while nature provided that men could live on all parts of

the earth she also at the same time despotically willed that

they should live everywhere on it although against their own

inclination and even although this imperative did not presuppose

an idea of duty which would compel obedience to nature with the

force of a moral law but to attain this end she has chosen war

so we see certain peoples widely separated whose commonp 150 descent is made

evident by affinity in their languages thus for instance we find

the samoyedes on the arctic ocean and again a people speaking

a similar language on the altai mts 200 miles meilen139

off between whom has pressed in a mounted tribe warlike in

character and of mongolian origin which has driven one branch of

the race far from the other into the most inhospitable regions

where their own inclination would certainly not have carried them140

in the same way through the intrusion of the gothic and sarmatian

tribes the finns in the most northerly regions of europe whom we

call laplanders have been separated by as great a distance from the

hungarians with whose language their own is allied and what but war

can have brought the esquimos to the north of america a race quite

distinct from those of that country and probably european adventurers

ofp 151 prehistoric

times and war too natures method of populating the earth must

have driven the pescherais141 in south america as far as patagonia war

itself however is in need of no special stimulating cause but

seems engrafted in human nature and is even regarded as something

noble in itself to which man is inspired by the love of glory apart

from motives of selfinterest hence among the savages of america as

well as those of europe in the age of chivalry martial courage is

looked upon as of great value itself not merely when a war is going

on as is reasonable enough but in order that there should be war

and thus war is often entered upon merely to exhibit this quality

so that an intrinsic dignity is held to attach to war in itself and

even philosophers eulogise it as an ennobling refining influence on

humanity unmindful of the greek proverb war is evil in so far as

it makes more bad people than it takes away
so much then of what nature does for her own ends with regard

to the human race as members of the animal world now comes the

question which touches the essential points in this design of a

perpetual peacewhat does nature do in this respect with reference

to the end which mans ownp

152 reason sets before him as a duty and consequently what

does she do to further the realisation of his moral purpose how does

she guarantee that what man by the laws of freedom ought to do and

yet fails to do he will do without any infringement of his freedom

by the compulsion of nature and that moreover this shall be done

in accordance with the three forms of public rightconstitutional or

political law international law and cosmopolitan law when i say

of nature that she wills that this or that should take place i

do not mean that she imposes upon us the duty to do itfor only the

free unrestrained practical reason can do thatbut that she does

it herself whether we will or not fata volentem ducunt nolentem

trahunt
1 even if a people were not compelled through internal discord to

submit to the restraint of public laws war would bring this about

working from without for according to the contrivance of nature

which we have mentioned every people finds another tribe in its

neighbourhood pressing upon it in such a manner that it is compelled

to form itself internally into a state to be able to defend itself as

a power should now the republican constitution is the only one which

is perfectly adapted to the rights of man but it is also the most

difficult to establish and still more to maintain so generally is

this recognised that peoplep

153 often say the members of a republican state would

require to be angels142 because men with their selfseeking

propensities are not fit for a constitution of so sublime a form

but now nature comes to the aid of the universal reasonderived

will which much as we honour it is in practice powerless and this

she does by means of these very selfseeking propensities so that

it only dependsand so much lies within the power of manon a good

organisation of the state for their forces to be so pitted against

one another that the one may check the destructive activity of the

other or neutralise its effect and hence from the standpoint of

reason the result will be the same as if both forces did not exist

and each individual is compelled to be if not a morally good man

yet at least a good citizen the problem of the formation of the

state hard as it may sound is not insoluble even for ap 154 race of devils granted

that they have intelligence it may be put thusgiven a multitude

of rational beings who in a body require general laws for their

own preservation but each of whom as an individual is secretly

inclined to exempt himself from this restraint how are we to order

their affairs and how establish for them a constitution such that

although their private dispositions may be really antagonistic

they may yet so act as a check upon one another that in their

public relations the effect is the same as if they had no such evil

sentiments such a problem must be capable of solution for it

deals not with the moral reformation of mankind but only with the

mechanism of nature and the problem is to learn how this mechanism

of nature can be applied to men in order so to regulate the

antagonism of conflicting interests in a people that they may even

compel one another to submit to compulsory laws and thus necessarily

bring about the state of peace in which laws have force we can see

in states actually existing although very imperfectly organised

that in externals they already approximate very nearly to what

the idea of right prescribes although the principle of morality is

certainly not the cause a good political constitution however is

not to be expected as a result of progress in morality but rather

conversely the good moral condition of a nation is to be looked for

as one ofp 155 the

first fruits of such a constitution hence the mechanism of nature

working through the selfseeking propensities of man which of course

counteract one another in their external effects may be used by

reason as a means of making way for the realisation of her own

purpose the empire of right and as far as is in the power of the

state to promote and secure in this way internal as well as external

peace we may say then that it is the irresistible will of nature

that right shall at last get the supremacy what one here fails to

do will be accomplished in the long run although perhaps with much

inconvenience to us as bouterwek says if you bend the reed too

much it breaks he who would do too much does nothing
2 the idea of international law presupposes the separate

existence of a number of neighbouring and independent states and

although such a condition of things is in itself already a state

of war if a federative union of these nations does not prevent

the outbreak of hostilities yet according to the idea of reason

this is better than that all the states should be merged into one

under a power which has gained the ascendency over its neighbours

and gradually become a universal monarchy143 for the wider the

sphere of their jurisdicp

156tion the more laws lose in force and soulless despotism

when it has choked the seeds of good at last sinks into anarchy

nevertheless it is the desire of every state or of its ruler to

attain to a permanent condition of peace in this very way that is to

say by subjecting the whole world as far as possible to its sway

but nature wills it otherwise she employs two means to separate

nations and prevent them from intermixing namely the differences

of language and of religion144 these differences bring with them a

tendency to mutual hatred and furnish pretexts for waging war but

none the less with the growth of culture and the gradual advance

of men to greater unanimity of principle they lead to concord in a

state of peace which unlike the despotism we have spoken of the

churchyard of freedom does not arise from the weakening of all

forces but is brought into being and secured through the equilibrium

of these forces in their most active rivalry
p 1573 as nature

wisely separates nations which the will of each state sanctioned

even by the principles of international law would gladly unite under

its own sway by stratagem or force in the same way on the other

hand she unites nations whom the principle of a cosmopolitan right

would not have secured against violence and war and this union

she brings about through an appeal to their mutual interests the

commercial spirit cannot coexist with war and sooner or later it

takes possession of every nation for of all the forces which lie

at the command of a state the power of money is probably the most

reliable hence states find themselves compellednot it is true

exactly from motives of moralityto further the noble end of peace

and to avert war by means of mediation wherever it threatens to

break out just as if they had made a permanent league for this

purpose for great alliances with a view to war can from the nature

of things only very rarely occur and still more seldom succeed
in this way nature guarantees the coming of perpetual peace

through the natural course of human propensities not indeed with

sufficient certainty to enable us to prophesy the future of this

ideal theoretically but yet clearly enough for practical purposes

and thus this guarantee of nature makes it a duty that we should

labour for this end an end which is no mere chimera


p 158
second supplement
a secret article for perpetual peace

a secret

article in negotiations concerning public right is when looked

at objectively or with regard to the meaning of the term a

contradiction when we view it however from the subjective

standpoint with regard to the character and condition of the person

who dictates it we see that it might quite well involve some private

consideration so that he would regard it as hazardous to his dignity

to acknowledge such an article as originating from him
the only article of this kind is contained in the following

propositionthe opinions of philosophers with regard to the

conditions of the possibility of a public peace shall be taken into

consideration by states armed for war
it seems however to be derogatory to the dignity of the

legislative authority of a stateto which we must of course

attribute all wisdomto ask advice from subjects among whom stand

philosophers about the rules of its behaviour to other states at

the same time it is very advisable that this should be done hence

the state will silently invite suggestion for this purpose while

at the same time keeping the fact secret this amounts top 159 saying that the state

will allow philosophers to discuss freely and publicly the universal

principles governing the conduct of war and establishment of peace

for they will do this of their own accord if no prohibition

is laid upon them145 the arrangement between states on this

point does not require that a special agreement should be made

merely for this purpose for it is already involved in the obligation

imposed by the universal reason of man which gives the moral law we

would not be understood to say that the state must give a preference

to the principles of the philosopher rather than to the opinions

of the jurist the representative of state authority but only

that he should be heard the latter who has chosen for a symbol

the scales of right and the sword of justice146 generally uses that

sword not merely to keep off all outside influences from the scales

for when one pan of the balance will not go down he throws his

sword into it and then v victis the jurist not beingp 160 a moral philosopher is

under the greatest temptation to do this because it is his business

only to apply existing laws and not to investigate whether these

are not themselves in need of improvement and this actually lower

function of his profession he looks upon as the nobler because it

is linked to power as is the case also in both the other faculties

theology and medicine philosophy occupies a very low position

compared with this combined power so that it is said for example

that she is the handmaid of theology and the same has been said of

her position with regard to law and medicine it is not quite clear

however whether she bears the torch before these gracious ladies

or carries the train
that kings should philosophise or philosophers become kings

is not to be expected but neither is it to be desired for the

possession of power is inevitably fatal to the free exercise of

reason but it is absolutely indispensable for their enlightenment

as to the full significance of their vocations that both kings and

sovereign nations which rule themselves in accordance with laws of

equality should not allow the class of philosophers to disappear

nor forbid the expression of their opinions but should allow

them to speak openly and since this class of men by their very

nature are incapable of instigating rebellion or forming unions for

purposes of political agitation they should not be suspected of

propagandism


p 161
appendix i
on the disagreement between morals and politics with

  reference to perpetual peace

in

an objective sense morals is a practical science as the sum of

laws exacting unconditional obedience in accordance with which we

ought to act now once we have admitted the authority of this

idea of duty it is evidently inconsistent that we should think of

saying that we cannot act thus for in this case the idea of duty

falls to the ground of itself ultra posse nemo obligatur hence

there can be no quarrel between politics as the practical science of

right and morals which is also a science of right but theoretical

that is theory cannot come into conflict with practice for in that

case we would need to understand under the term ethics or morals

a universal doctrine of expediency or in other words a theory of

precepts which may guide us in choosing the best means for attaining

ends calculated for our advantage this is to deny that a science of

morals exists
p 162
politics says be wise as serpents morals adds the limiting

condition and guileless as doves if these precepts cannot stand

together in one command then there is a real quarrel between

politics and morals147 but if they can be completely brought into

accord then the idea of any antagonism between them is absurd and

the question of how best to make a compromise between the two points

of view ceases to be even raised although the saying honesty is

the best policyp 163

expresses a theory which alas is often contradicted in practice

yet the likewise theoretical maxim honesty is better than any

policy is exalted high above every possible objection is indeed

the necessary condition of all politics
the terminus of morals does not yield to jupiter the terminus

of force for the latter remains beneath the sway of fate in other

words reason is not sufficiently enlightened to survey the series

of predetermining causes which would make it possible for us to

predict with certainty the good or bad results of human action as

they follow from the mechanical laws of nature although we may hope

that things will turn out as we should desire but what we have to

do in order to remain in the path of duty guided by the rules of

wisdom reason makes everywhere perfectly clear and does this for

the purpose of furthering her ultimate ends
the practical man however for whom morals is mere theory even

while admitting that what ought to be can be bases his dreary

verdict against our wellmeant hopes really on this he pretends

that he can foresee from his observation of human nature that men

will never be willing to do what is required in order to bring about

the wishedfor results leading to perpetual peace it is true that

the will of all individual men to live under a legal constitution

according to the principles of libertyp 164that is to say the distributive

unity of the wills of allis not sufficient to attain this end we

must have the collective unity of their united will all as a body

must determine these new conditions the solution of this difficult

problem is required in order that civil society should be a whole

to all this diversity of individual wills there must come a uniting

cause in order to produce a common will which no distributive will

is able to give hence in the practical realisation of that idea no

other beginning of a lawgoverned society can be counted upon than

one that is brought about by force upon this force too public law

afterwards rests this state of things certainly prepares us to meet

considerable deviation in actual experience from the theoretical

idea of perpetual peace since we cannot take into account the moral

character and disposition of a lawgiver in this connection or

expect that after he has united a wild multitude into one people he

will leave it to them to bring about a legal constitution by their

common will
it amounts to this any ruler who has once got the power in his

hands will not let the people dictate laws for him a state which

enjoys an independence of the control of external law will not

submit to the judgment of the tribunals of other states when it has

to consider how to obtainp

165 its rights against them and even a continent when

it feels its superiority to another whether this be in its way

or not will not fail to take advantage of an opportunity offered

of strengthening its power by the spoliation or even conquest of

this territory hence all theoretical schemes connected with

constitutional international or cosmopolitan law crumble away into

empty impracticable ideals while on the other hand a practical

science based on the empirical principles of human nature which

does not disdain to model its maxims on an observation of actual

life can alone hope to find a sure foundation on which to build up a

system of national policy
now certainly if there is neither freedom nor a moral law

founded upon it and every actual or possible event happens in

the mere mechanical course of nature then politics as the

art of making use of this physical necessity in things for the

government of men is the whole of practical wisdom and the idea

of right is an empty concept if on the other hand we find that

this idea of right is necessarily to be conjoined with politics

and even to be raised to the position of a limiting condition of

that science then the possibility of reconciling them must be

admitted i can thus imagine a moral politician that is to say one

who understands the principles of statesmanship to be such as do

notp 166 conflict with

morals but i cannot conceive of a political moralist who fashions

for himself such a system of ethics as may serve the interest of

statesmen
the moral politician will always act upon the following

principleif certain defects which could not have been avoided

are found in the political constitution or foreign relations of a

state it is a duty for all especially for the rulers of the state

to apply their whole energy to correcting them as soon as possible

and to bringing the constitution and political relations on these

points into conformity with the law of nature as it is held up as a

model before us in the idea of reason and this they should do even

at a sacrifice of their own interest now it is contrary to all

politicswhich is in this particular in agreement with moralsto

dissever any of the links binding citizens together in the state

or nations in cosmopolitan union before a better constitution is

there to take the place of what has been thus destroyed and hence

it would be absurd indeed to demand that every imperfection in

political matters must be violently altered on the spot but at the

same time it may be required of a ruler at least that he should

earnestly keep the maxim in mind which points to the necessity of

such a change so that he may go on constantly approaching the end

to be realisedp 167

namely the best possible constitution according to the laws of

right even although it is still under despotic rule in accordance

with its constitution as then existing a state may govern itself

on republican lines until the people gradually become capable of

being influenced by the mere idea of the authority of law just as

if it had physical power and they become accordingly capable of

selflegislation their faculty for which is founded on original

right but if through the violence of revolution the product of

a bad government a constitution more in accord with the spirit of

law were attained even by unlawful means it should no longer be

held justifiable to bring the people back to the old constitution

although while the revolution was going on every one who took

part in it by use of force or stratagem may have been justly

punished as a rebel as regards the external relations of nations

a state cannot be asked to give up its constitution even although

that be a despotism which is at the same time the strongest

constitution where foreign enemies are concerned so long as it

runs the risk of being immediately swallowed up by other states

hence when such a proposal is made the state whose constitution is

in question must at least be allowed to defer acting upon it until

a more convenient time148 p 168 it is always possible that

moralists who rule despotically and are at a loss in practical

matters will come into collision with the rules of political wisdom

in many ways by adopting measures without sufficient deliberation

which show themselves afterwards to have been overestimated when

they thus offend against nature experience must gradually lead them

into a better track but instead of this being the case politicians

who are fond of moralising do all they can to make moral improvement

impossible and to perpetuate violations of law by extenuating

political principles which are antagonistic to the idea of right on

the pretext that human nature is not capable of good in the sense of

the ideal which reason prescribes
these politicians instead of adopting an open straightforward

way of doing things as they boast mix themselves up in intrigue

they get at thep 169

authorities in power and say what will please them their sole

bent is to sacrifice the nation or even if they can the whole

world with the one end in view that their own private interest

may be forwarded this is the manner of regular jurists i mean

the journeyman lawyer not the legislator when they aspire to

politics for as it is not their business to reason too nicely over

legislation but only to enforce the laws of the country every

legal constitution in its existing form and when this is changed

by the proper authorities the one which takes its place will

always seem to them the best possible and the consequence is that

everything is purely mechanical but this adroitness in suiting

themselves to any circumstances may lead them to the delusion that

they are also capable of giving an opinion about the principles of

political constitutions in general in so far as they conform to

ideas of right and are therefore not empirical but a priori and

they may therefore brag about their knowledge of menwhich indeed

one expects to find since they have to deal with so manywithout

really knowing the nature of man and what can be made of it to gain

which knowledge a higher standpoint of anthropological observation

than theirs is required filled with ideas of this kind if they

trespass outside their own sphere on the boundaries of political

and international lawp

170 looked upon as ideals which reason holds before us they

can do so only in the spirit of chicanery for they will follow their

usual method of making everything conform mechanically to compulsory

laws despotically made and enforced even here where the ideas of

reason recognise the validity of a legal compulsory force only when

it is in accordance with the principles of freedom through which a

permanently valid constitution becomes first of all possible the

wouldbe practical man leaving out of account this idea of reason

thinks that he can solve this problem empirically by looking to the

way in which those constitutions which have best survived the test

of time were established even although the spirit of these may have

been generally contrary to the idea of right the principles which

he makes use of here although indeed he does not make them public

amount pretty much to the following sophistical maxims
1 fac et excusa seize the most favourable opportunity for

arbitrary usurpationeither of the authority of the state over its

own people or over a neighbouring people the justification of the

act and extenuation of the use of force will come much more easily

and gracefully when the deed is done than if one has to think

out convincing reasons for taking this step and first hear through

all the objections which can be made against it this isp 171 especially true in

the first case mentioned where the supreme power in the state also

controls the legislature which we must obey without any reasoning

about it besides this show of audacity in a statesman even lends

him a certain semblance of inward conviction of the justice of

his action and once he has got so far the god of success bonus

eventus is his best advocate
2 si fecisti nega as for any crime you have committed

such as has for instance brought your people to despair and thence

to insurrection deny that it has happened owing to any fault of

yours say rather that it is all caused by the insubordination of

your subjects or in the case of your having usurped a neighbouring

state that human nature is to blame for if a man is not ready to

use force and steal a march upon his neighbour he may certainly

count on the latter forestalling him and taking him prisoner
3 divide et impera that is to say if there are certain

privileged persons holding authority among the people who have

merely chosen you for their sovereign as primus inter pares

bring about a quarrel among them and make mischief between them

and the people now back up the people with a dazzling promise of

greater freedom everything will now depend unconditionally on your

will or again if there is a difficulty withp 172 foreign states then to stir up

dissension among them is a pretty sure means of subjecting first one

and then the other to your sway under the pretext of aiding the

weaker
it is true that nowadays no body is taken in by these political

maxims for they are all familiar to everyone moreover there is

no need of being ashamed of them as if their injustice were too

patent for the great powers never feel shame before the judgment of

the common herd but only before one another so that as far as this

matter goes it is not the revelation of these guiding principles of

policy that can make rulers ashamed but only the unsuccessful use

of them for as to the morality of these maxims politicians are all

agreed hence there is always left political prestige on which they

can safely count and this means the glory of increasing their power

by any means that offer149
      
in all these twistings and turnings of an immoral doctrine of

expediency which aims at substituting a state of peace for the

warlike conditions in which men are placed by nature so much at

least is clearthat men cannot get away fromp 173 the idea of right in their private any

more than in their public relations and that they do not dare this

is indeed most strikingly seen in the concept of an international

law to base politicsp

174 merely on the manipulations of expediency and therefore

to refuse all obedience to the idea of a public right on the

contrary they pay all fitting honour to the idea of right in itself

even although they should at the same time devise a hundred

subterfuges and excuses to avoid it in practice and should regard

force backed up by cunning as having the authority which comes

from being the source and unifying principle of all right it will

be well to put an end to this sophistry if not to the injustice it

extenuates and to bring the false advocates of the mighty of the

earth to confess that it is not right but might in whose interest

they speak and that it is the worship of might from which they take

their cue as if in this matter they had a right to command in order

to do this we must first expose the delusion by which they deceive

themp 175selves and

others then discover the ultimate principle from which their plans

for a perpetual peace proceed and thence show that all the evil

which stands in the way of the realisation of that ideal springs

from the fact that the political moralist begins where the moral

politician rightly ends and that by subordinating principles to an

end or putting the cart before the horse he defeats his intention of

bringing politics into harmony with morals
in order to make practical philosophy consistent with itself

we must first decide the following questionin dealing with the

problems of practical reason must we begin from its material

principlethe end as the object of free choiceor from its formal

principle which is based merely on freedom in its external

relationfrom which comes the following lawact so that thou

canst will that thy maxim should be a universal law be the end of

thy action what it will150
without doubt the latter determining principle of action must

stand first for as a principle of right it carries unconditional

necessity with it whereas the former is obligatory only if we

assume the empirical conditions of the end set before usthat is

to say that it is an end capable of beingp 176 practically realised and if this

endas for example the end of perpetual peaceshould be also a

duty this same duty must necessarily have been deduced from the

formal principle governing the maxims which guide external action

now the first principle is the principle of the political moralist

the problems of constitutional international and cosmopolitan law

are mere technical problems problema technicum the second or

formal principle on the other hand as the principle of the moral

politician who regards it as a moral problem problema morale

differs widely from the other principle in its methods of bringing

about perpetual peace which we desire not only as a material good

but also as a state of things resulting from our recognition of

the precepts of duty151
to solve the first problemthat namely of political

expediencymuch knowledge of nature is required that her mechanical

laws may be employed for the end in view and yet the result of all

knowledge of this kind is uncertain as far as perpetual peace is

concerned this we find to be so whichever of the three departments

of public law we take it is uncertain whether a people could be

better kept in obedience and at the same time prosperity by severity

or by baits held out to theirp

177 vanity whether they would be better governed under the

sovereignty of a single individual or by the authority of several

acting together whether the combined authority might be better

secured merely say by an official nobility or by the power of the

people within the state and finally whether such conditions could

be long maintained there are examples to the contrary in history

in the case of all forms of government with the exception of the

only true republican constitution the idea of which can occur only

to a moral politician still more uncertain is a law of nations

ostensibly established upon statutes devised by ministers for this

amounts in fact to mere empty words and rests on treaties which

in the very act of ratification contain a secret reservation of

the right to violate them on the other hand the solution of the

second problemthe problem of political wisdomforces itself we may

say upon us it is quite obvious to every one and puts all crooked

dealings to shame it leads too straight to the desired end while

at the same time discretion warns us not to drag in the conditions

of perpetual peace by force but to take time and approach this ideal

gradually as favourable circumstances permit
this may be expressed in the following maximseek ye first

the kingdom of pure practical reason and its righteousness and

the object of your enp

178deavour the blessing of perpetual peace will be

added unto you for the science of morals generally has this

peculiarityand it has it also with regard to the moral principles

of public law and therefore with regard to a science of politics

knowable a priorithat the less it makes a mans conduct depend

on the end he has set before him his purposed material or moral

gain so much the more nevertheless does it conform in general

to this end the reason for this is that it is just the universal

will given a priori which exists in a people or in the relation

of different peoples to one another that alone determines what is

lawful among men this union of individual wills however if we

proceed consistently in practice in observance of the mechanical

laws of nature may be at the same time the cause of bringing about

the result intended and practically realizing the idea of right

hence it is for example a principle of moral politics that a people

should unite into a state according to the only valid concepts

of right the ideas of freedom and equality and this principle

is not based on expediency but upon duty political moralists

however do not deserve a hearing much and sophistically as they

may reason about the existence in a multitude of men forming a

society of certain natural tendencies which would weaken those

principles and defeat their intention theyp 179 may endeavour to prove their assertion

by giving instances of badly organised constitutions chosen both

from ancient and modern times as for example democracies without

a representative system but such arguments are to be treated with

contempt all the more because a pernicious theory of this kind

may perhaps even bring about the evil which it prophesies for in

accordance with such reasoning man is thrown into a class with all

other living machines which only require the consciousness that they

are not free creatures to make them in their own judgment the most

miserable of all beings
fiat justitia pereat mundus this saying has become proverbial

and although it savours a little of boastfulness is also true we

may translate it thuslet justice rule on earth although all the

rogues in the world should go to the bottom it is a good honest

principle of right cutting off all the crooked ways made by knavery

or violence it must not however be misunderstood as allowing

anyone to exercise his own rights with the utmost severity a course

in contradiction to our moral duty but we must take it to signify an

obligation binding upon rulers to refrain from refusing to yield

anyone his rights or from curtailing them out of personal feeling

or sympathy for others for this end in particular we require

firstly that a statep

180 should have an internal political constitution

established according to the pure principles of right secondly

that a union should be formed between this state and neighbouring or

distant nations for a legal settlement of their differences after

the analogy of the universal state this proposition means nothing

more than thispolitical maxims must not start from the idea of a

prosperity and happiness which are to be expected from observance

of such precepts in every state that is not from the end which

each nation makes the object of its will as the highest empirical

principle of political wisdom but they must set out from the pure

concept of the duty of right from the ought whose principle

is given a priori through pure reason this is the law whatever

the material consequences may be the world will certainly not

perish by any means because the number of wicked people in it is

becoming fewer the morally bad has one peculiarity inseparable from

its naturein its purposes especially in relation to other evil

influences it is in contradiction with itself and counteracts its

own natural effect and thus makes room for the moral principle of

good although advance in this direction may be slow
hence objectively in theory there is no quarrel between morals

and politics but subjectively in the selfseeking tendencies of men

which we cannotp 181

actually call their morality as we would a course of action based

on maxims of reason this disagreement in principle exists and may

always survive for it serves as a whetstone to virtue according

to the principle tu ne cede malis sed contra audentior ito the

true courage of virtue in the present case lies not so much in facing

the evils and selfsacrifices which must be met here as in firmly

confronting the evil principle in our own nature and conquering its

wiles for this is a principle far more dangerous false treacherous

and sophistical which puts forward the weakness in human nature as a

justification for every transgression
in fact the political moralist may say that a ruler and people

or nation and nation do one another no wrong when they enter on

a war with violence or cunning although they do wrong generally

speaking in refusing to respect the idea of right which alone could

establish peace for all time for as both are equally wrongly

disposed to one another each transgressing the duty he owes to his

neighbour they are both quite rightly served when they are thus

destroyed in war this mutual destruction stops short at the point of

extermination so that there are always enough of the race left to

keep this game going on through all the ages and a faroff posterity

may take warningp 182

by them the providence that orders the course of the world is

hereby justified for the moral principle in mankind never becomes

extinguished and human reason fitted for the practical realisation

of ideas of right according to that principle grows continually in

fitness for that purpose with the ever advancing march of culture

while at the same time it must be said the guilt of transgression

increases as well but it seems that by no theodicy or vindication

of the justice of god can we justify creation in putting such a

race of corrupt creatures into the world at all if that is we

assume that the human race neither will nor can ever be in a happier

condition than it is now this standpoint however is too high a

one for us to judge from or to theorise with the limited concepts

we have at our command about the wisdom of that supreme power which

is unknowable by us we are inevitably driven to such despairing

conclusions as these if we do not admit that the pure principles of

right have objective realitythat is to say are capable of being

practically realisedand consequently that action must be taken on

the part of the people of a state and further by states in relation

to one another whatever arguments empirical politics may bring

forward against this course politics in the real sense cannot take

a step forward without first paying homagep 183 to the principles of morals and

although politics per se is a difficult art152 in its union with

morals no art is required for in the case of a conflict arising

between the two sciences the moralist can cut asunder the knot

which politics is unable to untie right must be held sacred by man

however great the cost and sacrifice to the ruling power here is no

halfandhalf course we cannot devise a happy medium between right

and expediency a right pragmatically conditioned but all politics

must bend the knee to the principle of right and may in that way

hope to reach although slowly perhaps a level whence it may shine

upon men for all time


p 184
appendix ii
concerning the harmony of politics with morals

  according to the transcendental idea of public right

if

i look at public right from the point of view of most professors

of law and abstract from its matter or its empirical elements

varying according to the circumstances given in our experience of

individuals in a state or of states among themselves then there

remains the form of publicity the possibility of this publicity

every legal title implies for without it there could be no justice

which can only be thought as before the eyes of men and without

justice there would be no right for from justice only right can

come
this characteristic of publicity must belong to every legal

title hence as in any particular case that occurs there is no

difficulty in deciding whether this essential attribute is present

or not whether that is it is reconcilable with the principles of

the agent or not it furnishes an easily applied criterionp 185 which is to be found a

priori in the reason so that in the particular case we can at once

recognise the falsity or illegality of a proposed claim praetensio

juris as it were by an experiment of pure reason
having thus as it were abstracted from all the empirical

elements contained in the concept of a political and international

law such as for instance the evil tendency in human nature which

makes compulsion necessary we may give the following proposition as

the transcendental formula of public rightall actions relating

to the rights of other men are wrong if the maxims from which they

follow are inconsistent with publicity
this principle must be regarded not merely as ethical as

belonging to the doctrine of virtue but also as juridical referring

to the rights of men for there is something wrong in a maxim of

conduct which i cannot divulge without at once defeating my purpose

a maxim which must therefore be kept secret if it is to succeed and

which i could not publicly acknowledge without infallibly stirring up

the opposition of everyone this necessary and universal resistance

with which everyone meets me a resistance therefore evident a

priori can be due to no other cause than the injustice with which

such a maxim threatens everyone further this testing principle is

merely negative that is it serves only as a means by which we may

knowp 186 when an

action is unjust to others like axioms it has a certainty incapable

of demonstration it is besides easy of application as appears from

the following examples of public right
1constitutional law let us take in the first place

the public law of the state jus civitatis particularly in its

application to matters within the state here a question arises

which many think difficult to answer but which the transcendental

principle of publicity solves quite readilyis revolution a

legitimate means for a people to adopt for the purpose of throwing

off the oppressive yoke of a socalled tyrant non titulo sed

exercitio talis the rights of a nation are violated in a

government of this kind and no wrong is done to the tyrant in

dethroning him of this there is no doubt none the less it is in

the highest degree wrong of the subjects to prosecute their rights in

this way and they would be just as little justified in complaining

if they happened to be defeated in their attempt and had to endure

the severest punishment in consequence
a great many reasons for and against both sides of this

question may be given if we seek to settle it by a dogmatic

deduction of the principles of right but the transcendental

principle of the publicity of public right can spare itself this

diffuse argumentation for according to that principle thep 187 people would ask

themselves before the civil contract was made whether they could

venture to publish maxims proposing insurrection when a favourable

opportunity should present itself it is quite clear that if when

a constitution is established it were made a condition that force

may be exercised against the sovereign under certain circumstances

the people would be obliged to claim a lawful authority higher than

his but in that case the socalled sovereign would be no longer

sovereign or if both powers that of the sovereign and that of

the people were made a condition of the constitution of the state

then its establishment which was the aim of the people would be

impossible the wrongfulness of revolution is quite obvious from

the fact that openly to acknowledge maxims which justify this step

would make attainment of the end at which they aim impossible we are

obliged to keep them secret but this secrecy would not be necessary

on the part of the head of the state he may say quite plainly

that the ringleaders of every rebellion will be punished by death

even although they may hold that it was he who first transgressed

the fundamental law for if a ruler is conscious of possessing

irresistible sovereign power and this must be assumed in every civil

constitution because a sovereign who has not power to protect any

individual memberp 188

of the nation against his neighbour has also not the right to

exercise authority over him then he need have no fear that making

known the maxims which guide him will cause the defeat of his plans

and it is quite consistent with this view to hold that if the people

are successful in their insurrection the sovereign must return to

the rank of a subject and refrain from inciting rebellion with a

view to regaining his lost sovereignty at the same time he need have

no fear of being called to account for his former administration153
p 189
2international law there can be no question of an

international law except on the assumption of some kind of a

lawgoverned state of things the external condition under which any

right can belong to man for the very idea of international law as

public right implies the publication of a universal will determining

the rights and property of each individual nation and this status

juridicus must spring out of a contract of some sort which may not

like the contract to which the state owes its origin be founded

upon compulsory laws but may be at the most the agreement of a

permanent free association such as the federation of the different

states to which we have alluded above for without the control

of law to some extent to serve as an active bond of union among

different merely natural or moral individualsthat is to say in

a state of naturethere can only be private law and here we find

a disagreement between morals regarded as the science of right

and politics the criterion obtained by observing the effect of

publicity on maxims is just as easily applied but only when we

understand that this agreement binds the contracting states solely

with the object that peace may be preserved among them and between

them and other states in no sense with a view to the acquisition of

new territory or power the following instances of antinomy occur

betweenp 190 politics

and morals which are given here with the solution in each case
a when either of these states has promised something to

another as for instance assistance or a relinquishment of

certain territory or subsidies and such like the question may

arise whether in a case where the safety of the state thus bound

depends on its evading the fulfilment of this promise it can do so

by maintaining a right to be regarded as a double personfirstly

as sovereign and accountable to no one in the state of which that

sovereign power is head and secondly merely as the highest

official in the service of that state who is obliged to answer to

the state for every action and the result of this is that the state

is acquitted in its second capacity of any obligation to which it has

committed itself in the first but if a nation or its sovereign

proclaimed these maxims the natural consequence would be that every

other would flee from it or unite with other states to oppose such

pretensions and this is a proof that politics with all its cunning

defeats its own ends if the test of making principles of action

public which we have indicated be applied hence the maxim we have

quoted must be wrong
b if a state which has increased its power to a formidable

extent potentia tremenda excites anxiety in its neighbours is it

right to assumep 191

that since it has the means it will also have the will to oppress

others and does that give less powerful states a right to unite and

attack the greater nation without any definite cause of offence a

state which would here answer openly in the affirmative would only

bring the evil about more surely and speedily for the greater power

would forestall those smaller nations and their union would be but

a weak reed of defence against a state which knew how to apply the

maxim divide et impera this maxim of political expediency then

when openly acknowledged necessarily defeats the end at which it

aims and is therefore wrong
c if a smaller state by its geographical position breaks

up the territory of a greater so as to prevent a unity necessary

to the preservation of that state is the latter not justified in

subjugating its less powerful neighbour and uniting the territory

in question with its own we can easily see that the greater state

dare not publish such a maxim beforehand for either all smaller

states would without loss of time unite against it or other powers

would contend for this booty hence the impracticability of such a

maxim becomes evident under the light of publicity and this is a

sign that it is wrong and that in a very great degree for although

the victim of an act of injustice may bep 192 of small account that does not prevent

the injustice done from being very great
3cosmopolitan law we may pass over this department of

right in silence for owing to its analogy with international law

its maxims are easily specified and estimated
      
in this principle of the incompatibility of the maxims of

international law with their publicity we have a good indication

of the nonagreement between politics and morals regarded as a

science of right now we require to know under what conditions these

maxims do agree with the law of nations for we cannot conclude that

the converse holds and that all maxims which can bear publicity

are therefore just for anyone who has a decided supremacy has

no need to make any secret about his maxims the condition of a

law of nations being possible at all is that in the first place

there should be a lawgoverned state of things if this is not so

there can be no public right and all right which we can think of

outside the lawgoverned statethat is to say in the state of

natureis mere private right now we have seenp 193 above that something of the nature of

a federation between nations for the sole purpose of doing away

with war is the only rightful condition of things reconcilable

with their individual freedom hence the agreement of politics and

morals is only possible in a federative union a union which is

necessarily given a priori according to the principles of right

and the lawful basis of all politics can only be the establishment

of this union in its widest possible extent apart from this end

all political sophistry is folly and veiled injustice now this sham

politics has a casuistry not to be excelled in the best jesuit

school it has its mental reservation reservatio mentalis as

in the drawing up of a public treaty in such terms as we can if we

will interpret when occasion serves to our advantage for example

the distinction between the status quo in fact de fait and

in right de droit secondly it has its probabilism when it

pretends to discover evil intentions in another or makes the

probability of their possible future ascendency a lawful reason

for bringing about the destruction of other peaceful states

finally it has its philosophical sin peccatum philosophicum

peccatillum baggatelle which is that of holding it a trifle

easily pardoned that a smaller state should be swallowed up if this

be to the gain of a nation much more powerful for such an increase

in power isp 194

supposed to tend to the greater prosperity of the whole world154
duplicity gives politics the advantage of using one branch or

the other of morals just as suits its own ends the love of our

fellowmen is a duty so too is respect for their rights but the

former is only conditional the latter on the other hand an

unconditional absolutely imperative duty and anyone who would

give himself up to the sweet consciousness of welldoing must be

first perfectly assured that he has not transgressed its commands

politics has no difficulty in agreeing with morals in the first sense

of the term as ethics to secure that men should give to superiors

their rights but when it comes to morals in its second aspect

as the science of right before which politics must bow the knee

the politician finds it prudent to have nothing to do with compacts

and rather to deny all reality to morals in this sense and reduce

all duty to mere benevolence philosophy could easily frustrate the

artifices of a politics likep

195 this which shuns the light of criticism by publishing

its maxims if only statesmen would have the courage to grant

philosophers the right to ventilate their opinions
with this end in view i propose another principle of public

right which is at once transcendental and affirmative its formula

would be as followsall maxims which require publicity in order

that they may not fail to attain their end are in agreement both

with right and politics
for if these maxims can only attain the end at which they aim

by being published they must be in harmony with the universal end

of mankind which is happiness and to be in sympathy with this to

make the people contented with their lot is the real business of

politics now if this end should be attainable only by publicity or

in other words through the removal of all distrust of the maxims of

politics these must be in harmony with the right of the people for

a union of the ends of all is only possible in a harmony with this

right
i must postpone the further development and discussion of this

principle till another opportunity that it is a transcendental

formula is quite evident from the fact that all the empirical

conditions of a doctrine of happiness or the matter of law are

absent and that it has regard only to the form of universal

conformity to law

if it is our duty to realise a state of public right if at the

same time there are good grounds for hope that this ideal may be

realised although only by an approximation advancing ad infinitum

then perpetual peace following hitherto falsely socalled

conclusions of peace which have been in reality mere cessations of

hostilities is no mere empty idea but rather we have here a problem

which gradually works out its own solution and as the periods in

which a given advance takes place towards the realisation of the

ideal of perpetual peace will we hope become with the passing

of time shorter and shorter we must approach ever nearer to this

goal

3 the theory that the golden age was

identical with the state of nature professor d g ritchie ascribes

to locke see natural right ch ii p 42 locke he says has

an idea of a golden age existing even after government has come into

existencea time when people did not need to examine the original

and rights of government civil government ii  111 a little

confusion on the part of his readers perhaps in his own mind makes

it possible to regard the state of nature as itself the golden age

and the way is prepared for the favourite theory of the eighteenth

century

nor think in natures state they blindly trod
the state of nature was the reign of god
selflove and social at her birth began
union the bond of all things and of man
pride then was not nor arts that pride to aid
man walkd with beast joint tenant of the shade
the same his table and the same his bed
no murder cloathd him and no murder fed

essay on man iii 147 seq

in these lines of popes the state of nature is

identified with the golden age of the greek and latin poets and

the reign of god is an equivalent for lockes words has a law of

nature to govern it


4 cf republic ii 369 a state

says socrates arises out of the needs of mankind no one is

selfsufficing but all of us have many wants


5 see humes account of the origin

of government treatise iii part ii sect viii there

are he says american tribes where men live in concord and amity

among themselves without any established government and never pay

submission to any of their fellows except in time of war when

their captain enjoys a shadow of authority which he loses after

their return from the field and the establishment of peace with the

neighbouring tribes this authority however instructs them in the

advantages of government and teaches them to have recourse to it

when either by the pillage of war by commerce or by any fortuitous

inventions their riches and possessions have become so considerable

as to make them forget on every emergence the interest they have

in the preservation of peace and justice camps are the true

mothers of cities and as war cannot be administered by reason of

the suddenness of every exigency without some authority in a single

person the same kind of authority naturally takes place in that

civil government which succeeds the military
cf cowper the winter morning walk

and ere long
when man was multiplied and spread abroad
in tribes and clans and had begun to call
these meadows and that range of hills his own
the tasted sweets of property begat
desire of more 

thus wars began on earth these fought for spoil
and those in selfdefence savage at first
the onset and irregular at length
one eminent above the rest for strength
for stratagem or courage or for all
was chosen leader him they served in war
and him in peace for sake of warlike deeds
revrenced no less

thus kings were first invented



6 among uncivilised nations there

is but one profession honourable that of arms all the ingenuity and

vigour of the human mind are exerted in acquiring military skill or

address cf robertsons history of charles v works 1813

vol v sect i vii


7 similarly we find that the original

meaning of the latin word hostis was a stranger


8 in aristotle we find the highwater

mark of greek thinking on this subject the object of military

training says he politics bk iv ch xiv welldons

translationin older editions bk vii should be not to enslave

persons who do not deserve slavery but firstly to secure ourselves

against becoming the slaves of others secondly to seek imperial

power not with a view to a universal despotic authority but for

the benefit of the subjects whom we rule and thirdly to exercise

despotic power over those who are deserving to be slaves that

the legislator should rather make it his object so to order his

legislation upon military and other matters as to promote leisure

and peace is a theory borne out by the facts of history  loc

cit ch xv war as we have remarked several times has its end

in peace
aristotle strongly condemns the lacedmonians and

cretans for regarding war and conquest as the sole ends to which all

law and education should be directed also in nongreek tribes like

the scythians persians thracians and celts he says only military

power is admired by the people and encouraged by the state there

was formerly too a law in macedonia that any one who had never slain

an enemy should wear the halter about his neck among the iberians

too a military people it is the custom to set around the tomb of

a deceased warrior a number of obelisks corresponding to the number

of enemies he has killed yet  it may well appear to be a

startling paradox that it should be the function of a statesman to

succeed in devising the means of rule and mastery over neighbouring

peoples whether with or against their own will how can such action

be worthy of a statesman or legislator when it has not even the

sanction of law op cit iv ch 2
we see that aristotle disapproves of a glorification

of war for its own sake and regards it as justifiable only in

certain circumstances methods of warfare adopted and proved in the

east would not have been possible in greece an act of treachery for

example such as that of jael judges iv 17 which was extolled

in songs of praise by the jews loc cit v 24 the greek

people would have been inclined to repudiate the stories of roman

history the behaviour of fabricius for instance or regulus and

the honourable conduct of prisoners on various occasions released on

parole show that this consciousness of certain principles of honour

in warfare was still more highly developed in rome
socrates in the republic v 469 470 gives

expression to a feeling which was gradually gaining ground in greece

that war between hellenic tribes was much more serious than war

between greeks and barbarians in such civil warfare he considered

the defeated ought not to be reduced to slavery nor the slain

despoiled nor hellenic territory devastated for any difference

between greek and greek is to be regarded by them as discord onlya

quarrel among friends which is not to be called war our

citizens ie in the ideal republic should thus deal with their

hellenic enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with

one another v 471
the views of plato and aristotle on this and other

questions were in advance of the custom and practice of their

time


9 the lord is a man of war said

moses exodus xv 3 cf psalms xxiv 8 he is mighty in

battle


10 this was bound up with the very

essence of islam the devout mussulman could suffer the existence of

no unbeliever tolerance or indifference was an attitude which his

faith made impossible when ye encounter the unbelievers quoth the

prophet koran ch 47 strike off their heads until ye have

made a great slaughter among them verily if god pleased he could

take vengeance on them without your assistance but he commandeth you

to fight his battles
the propagation of the faith by the sword was not only

commanded by the mohammedan religion it was that religion itself


11 see acts x 28ye know that

it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or

come unto one of another nation


12 neither however is there any

which regards the soldier as a murderer


13 in the early centuries of our era

christians seem to have occasionally refused to serve in the army

from religious scruples but soldiers were not always required to

change their profession after baptism and in acts x for example

nothing is said to indicate that the centurion cornelius would have

to leave the roman army see tertullian de corona antinicene

christian library p 348


14 there were socalled sacred

wars in greece but these were due mainly to disputes caused by the

amphictyonic league they were not religious in the sense in which

we apply the epithet to the thirty years war


15 the administration of justice

among rude illiterate people was not so accurate or decisive or

uniform as to induce men to submit implicitly to its determinations

every offended baron buckled on his armour and sought redress at

the head of his vassals his adversary met him in like hostile

array neither of them appealed to impotent laws which could afford

them no protection neither of them would submit points in which

their honour and their passions were warmly interested to the slow

determination of a judicial inquiry both trusted to their swords for

the decision of the contest robertsons history of charles v

works vol v sect i p 38


16 erasmus in the 

colloquies baileys ed vol ii pp 55 56 puts forward the

suggestion that a general peace might be obtained in the christian

world if the emperor would remit something of his right and the pope

some part of his

19 j a farrar in a pamphlet

reprinted from the gentlemans magazine vol 257 1884 on war

and christianity quotes the following passage from wycliffe in

which he protests against this blot upon the church and christian

professionsfriars now say that bishops can fight best of all men

and that it falleth most properly to them since they are lords of

all this world they say christ bade his disciples sell their coats

and buy them swords but whereto if not to fight thus friars make a

great array and stir up many men to fight but christ taught not his

apostles to fight with a sword of iron but with the sword of gods

word and which standeth in meekness of heart and in the prudence of

mans tongue if manslaying in others be odious to god much more

in priests who should be vicars of christ see also the passage

where erasmus points out that king david was not permitted to build

a temple to god because he was a man of blood nolo clericos ullo

sanguine contaminari gravis impietas opera ix 370 b
this question had already been considered by thomas

aquinas who decided that the clergy ought not to be allowed

to fight because the practices of warfare although right and

meritorious in themselves were not in accordance with a holy

calling summa ii 2 qu 40
aquinas held that warexcluding private waris

justifiable in a just cause so too did luther cf his pamphlet

ob kriegsleute auch in seligem stande sein knnen calvin and

zwingli the last of whom died sword in hand
with regard to the question of a fighting clergy

the passage quoted from origen pp 14 15 above has considerable

interest origen looks upon the active participation of priests in

warfare as something which everyone would admit to be impossible

erasmus even goes the length of saying that the most iniquitous peace

is better than the most just war op cit 636 c


21 cf robertson op cit note

xxi p 483 and sect i p 39


22 it is uncertain in what year the

de jure belli of gentilis was publisheda work to which grotius

acknowledges considerable indebtedness whewell in the preface to

his translation of grotius gives the date 1598 but some writers

suppose it to have been ten years earlier


23 this came about in two ways the

church of rome discouraged the growth of national sentiment at the

reformation the independence and unity of the different nations were

for the first time recognised that is to say the reformation laid

the foundation for a science of international law but from another

point of view it not only made such a code of rules possible it

made it necessary the effect of the reformation was not to diminish

the number of wars in which religious belief could play a part

moreover it displaced the pope from his former position as arbiter

in europe without setting up any judicial tribunal in his stead


24 cf cicero de officiis i

xi belli quidem aequitas sanctissime feciali populi romani jure

perscripta est see the reference to lawrences comments on this

subject p 9 above
wars says cicero are to be undertaken for this

end that we may live in peace without being injured but when we

obtain the victory we must preserve those enemies who behaved

without cruelty or inhumanity during the war for example our

forefathers received even as members of their state the tuscans

the qui the volscians the sabines and the hernici but utterly

destroyed carthage and numantia and while we are bound to

exercise consideration toward those whom we have conquered by force

so those should be received into our protection who throw themselves

upon the honour of our general and lay down their arms op

cit i xi bohns translation in engaging in war we ought

to make it appear that we have no other view but peace op cit

i xxiii
in fulfilling a treaty we must not sacrifice the

spirit to the letter de officiis i x there are also rights

of war and the faith of an oath is often to be kept with an enemy

op cit iii xxix
this is the first statement by a classical writer in

which the idea of justice being due to an enemy appears cicero goes

further particular states he says de legibus i i are only

members of a whole governed by reason


25 the saying is attributed to

pompeyshall i when i am preparing for war think of the laws


26 this implied however the idea

of a united christendom as against the infidel with which we may

compare the idea of a united hellas against persia in such things

we have the germ not only of international law but of the ideal of

federation


27 see maines ancient law pp

5053 pp 96101 grotius wrongly understood jus gentium a

collection of rules and principles determined by observation to be

common to the institutions which prevailed among the various italian

tribes to mean jus inter gentes the roman expression for

international law was not jus gentium but jus feciale
having adopted from the antonine jurisconsults says

maine the position that the jus gentium and the jus natur were

identical grotius with his immediate predecessors and his immediate

successors attributed to the law of nature an authority which

would never perhaps have been claimed for it if law of nations

had not in that age been an ambiguous expression they laid down

unreservedly that natural law is the code of states and thus put in

operation a process which has continued almost down to our own day

the process of engrafting on the international system rules which are

supposed to have been evolved from the unassisted contemplation of

the conception of nature there is too one consequence of immense

practical importance to mankind which though not unknown during the

early modern history of europe was never clearly or universally

acknowledged till the doctrines of the grotian school had prevailed

if the society of nations is governed by natural law the atoms

which compose it must be absolutely equal men under the sceptre

of nature are all equal and accordingly commonwealths are equal

if the international state be one of nature the proposition that

independent communities however different in size and power are

all equal in the view of the law of nations has largely contributed

to the happiness of mankind though it is constantly threatened by

the political tendencies of each successive age it is a doctrine

which probably would never have obtained a secure footing at all if

international law had not been entirely derived from the majestic

claims of nature by the publicists who wrote after the revival of

letters op cit p 100


28 the name international law was

first given to the law of nations by bentham principles of morals

and legislation xix  xxv


29 in the peace of westphalia 1648

the balance of power in europe was recognised on the basis of terms

such as these


30 grotius however is a

painstaking student of scripture and is willing to say something

in favour of peacenot a permanent peace that is to say the idea

of which would scarcely be likely to occur to anyone in the early

years of the seventeenth centurybut a plea for fewer shorter wars

if therefore he says a peace sufficiently safe can be had it

is not ill secured by the condonation of offenses and damages and

expenses especially among christians to whom the lord has given his

peace as his legacy and so st paul his best interpreter exhorts

us to live at peace with all men may god write these lessonshe

christendom in their hands de jure belli et pacis iii ch

court of arbitration should be established at rome of which the pope

should be made president while at the same time the old spiritual

authority should be restored to the church and excommunication be

the punishment of noncompliance with the arbitral decree such

plans he adds are as likely to succeed as that of m de st

48 hobbes realises clearly that

there probably never was such a state of war all over the world nor

a state of nature conforming to a common type the case is parallel

to the use of the term original contract as an explanation of

the manner in which the civil state came to be formed cf p 52

note
see also hume inquiry concerning the principles of

morals sect iii part i this poetical fiction of the golden

age is in some respects of a piece with the philosophical

fiction of the state of nature only that the former is represented

as the most charming and most peaceable condition which can possibly

be imagined whereas the latter is painted out as a state of mutual

war and violence attended with the most extreme necessity this

fiction of a state of nature as a state of war says hume in a note

to this passage is not the invention of hobbes plato republic

logical statement of what would be the condition of man apart from

civil society than as distinctly implying a historical theory

carries hobbes political theories to their logical conclusion if

we admit that right lies with might then right is with the people

in any revolution successfully carried out but see hobbes preface

to the philosophical rudiments and kants perpetual peace p

188 note spinoza in a letter thus alludes to this point of

differenceas regards political theories the difference which you

inquire about between hobbes and myself consists in this that i

always preserve natural right intact and only allot to the chief

magistrates in every state a right over their subjects commensurate

with the excess of their power over the power of the subjects this

is what always takes place in the state of nature epistle 50

50 professor paulsen immanuel

kant 2nd ed 1899 p 359eng trans p 353 points out that

pessimism and absolutism usually go together in the doctrines of

philosophers he gives as instances hobbes kant and schopenhauer
hobbes on dominion ch x 3 seq regarded an

absolute monarchy as the only proper form of government while in the

opinion of locke on civil government ii ch vii  90 91

it was no better than a state of nature kant would not have gone

quite so far as a philosopher he upheld the sovereignty of the

people and rejected a monarchy which was not governed in accordance

with republican principles as a citizen he denied the right of

resistance to authority cf perpetual peace pp 126 188

note


51 we find the same rule laid down

as early as the time of dante cf de monarchia bk ii 9when

two nations quarrel they are bound to try in every possible way to

arrange the quarrel by means of discussion it is only when this is

hopeless that they may declare war


52 rousseau contrat social i

vi regards the social contract as tacitly implied in every actual

society its articles are the same everywhere and are everywhere

tacitly admitted and recognised even though they may never have

found formal expression in any constitution in the same way he

speaks of a state of nature which no longer exists which perhaps

never has existed preface to the discourse on the causes of

inequality but rousseaus interpretation of these terms is on

the whole literal in spite of these single passages he speaks

throughout the contrat social as if history could actually record

the signing and drawing up of such documents hobbes hooker

ecclesiastical polity i sect 10see also ritchie darwin and

hegel p 210 seq hume and kant use more careful language it

cannot be denied writes hume of the original contract that

all government is at first founded on a contract and that the most

ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed chiefly by that

principle in vain are we asked in what records this charter of our

liberties is registered it was not written on parchment nor yet on

leaves or barks of trees it preceded the use of writing and all the

other civilised arts of life but we trace it plainly in the nature

of man and in the equality or something approaching equality which

we find in all the individuals of that species
this fine passage expresses admirably the views of

kant on this point cf werke rosenkranz ix 160 the original

contract is merely an idea of reason one of those ideas which we

think into things in order to explain them
hobbes does not professedly make the contract

historical but in lockes civil government ii ch viii 

102 there is some attempt made to give it a historical basisby

consent all were equal till by the same consent they set rulers

over themselves so that their politic societies all began from a

voluntary union and the mutual agreement of men freely acting in the

choice of their governors and forms of government
bluntschli points out theory of the state iv

ix p 294 and note that the same theory of contract on which

hobbes doctrine of an absolute government was based was made the

justification of violent resistance to the government at the time of

the french revolution the theory was differently applied by hobbes

locke and rousseau according to the first men leave the state of

nature when they surrender their rights to a sovereign and return

to that state during revolution but for rousseau this sovereign

authority is the people a revolution would be only a change of

ministry see cont soc iii ch xviii again locke holds

revolution to be justifiable in all cases where the governments have

not fulfilled the trust reposed by the people in them cf kants

perpetual peace p 188 note


53 if you unite many men writes

rousseau cont soc iv i and

consider them as one body they will have but one will and that will

must be to promote the common safety and general wellbeing of all

this volont gnrale the common element of all particular wills

cannot be in conflict with any of them op cit ii iii

57 unlike hegel whose ideal was the

prussian state as it was under frederick the great an enthusiastic

supporter of the power of monarchy he showed himself comparatively

indifferent to the progress of constitutional liberty


58 isolated passages are sometimes

quoted from kant in support of a theory that the present treatise

is at least half ironicala and that his views on the question of

perpetual peace did not essentially differ from those of leibniz

even war he says kritik d urteilskraft i book ii  28

when conducted in an orderly way and with reverence for the rights

of citizens has something of the sublime about it and the more

dangers a nation which wages war in this manner is exposed to and can

courageously overcome the nobler does its character grow while on

the other hand a prolonged peace usually has the effect of giving

free play to a purely commercial spirit and side by side with this

to an ignoble selfseeking to cowardice and effeminacy and the

result of this is generally a degradation of national character
this is certainly an admission that war which does

not violate the law of nations has a good side as well as a bad

we could look for no less in so clearsighted and unprejudiced a

thinker kant would have been the first to admit that under certain

conditions a nation can have no higher duty than to wage war war

is necessary but it is in contradiction to reason and the spirit

of right the scourge of mankind making more bad men than it

takes away the destroyer of every good kant calls it elsewhere

69 a large part of kants

requirements as they are expressed in these preliminary articles

has already been fulfilled the first art 1 is recognised in

theory at least by modern international law more cannot be said

a treaty of this kind is of necessity more or less forced by the

stronger on the weaker the formal ratification of peace in 1871

did not prevent france from longing for the day when she might win

back alsacelorraine and be revenged on prussia not the treaty nor

a consciousness of defeat has kept the peace west of the rhine but

a reluctant respect for the fortress of metz and the mighty army of

united germany
articles 2 and 6 are already commonplaces of

international law article 2 refers to practices which have not

survived the gradual disappearance of dynastic war art 6 is the

basis of our modern law of war art 3 has been fulfilled in the

literal sense that the standing armies composed of mercenary troops

to which kant alludes exist no longer but it is to be feared that

kant would not think that we have made things much better nor

regard our present system of progressive armaments as a step in the

direction of perpetual peace art 4 is not likely to be fulfilled in

the near future it is long since cobden denounced the institution

of national debtsan institution which as kant points out owes its

origin to the english the commercial people referred to in the

text art 5 no doubt came to kant through vattel no nation says

the swiss publicist law of nations ii ch iv  54 has the

least right to interfere with the government of another unless he

adds ch v  70 in a case of anarchy or where the wellbeing of

the human race demands it this is a recognised principle of modern

international law intervention is held to be justifiable only where

the obligation to respect anothers freedom of action comes into

conflict with the duty of selfpreservation
puffendorf leaves much more room for the exercise of

benevolence the natural affinity and kinship between men is says

72 kant believed that in the newly

formed constitution of the united states his ideal with regard

to the external forms of the state as conforming to the spirit of

justice was most nearly realised professor paulsen draws attention

in the following passage to the fact that kant held the english

government of the eighteenth century in very low esteem kant

p 357 note see eng trans p 352 note it was not the

english state he says which furnished kant with an illustration of

his theoryrather in it he sees a form of despotism only slightly

veiled not parliamentary despotism as some people have thought but

monarchical despotism through bribery of the commons and the press

the king had actually absolute power as was evident above all from

the fact that he had often waged war without and in defiance of

the will of the people kant has a very unfavourable opinion of the

english state in every way among the collected notes written by him

in the last ten years of the century and published by reicke lose

bltter i 129 the following appearsthe english nation gens

regarded as a people populus and looked upon side by side with

other races is as a collection of individuals of all mankind the

most highly to be esteemed but as a state compared with other

states it is the most destructive highhanded and tyrannical and

the most provocative of war among them all
kuno fischer op cit vol v i ch 11 pp 150

151 to whom professor paulsens reference may here perhaps allude

states that kants objection to the english constitution is that it

was an oligarchy parliament being not only a legislative body but

through its ministers also executive in the interests of the ruling

party or even of private individuals in that party it seems more

likely that what most offended a keen observer of the course of the

american war of independence was the arbitrary and illdirected

power of the king but see the passage quoted by fischer pp 152

153 from the rechtslehre part ii sect i which is he says

unmistakeably directed against the english constitution and certain

temporary conditions in the political history of the country

75 this was the ideal of dante cf

de monarchia bk i 54we shall not find at any time except

under the divine monarch augustus when a perfect monarchy existed

that the world was everywhere quiet
bluntschli theory of the state i ch ii p 26

seq gives an admirable account of the different attempts made

to realise a universal empire in the pastthe empire of alexander

the great based upon a plan of uniting the races of east and west

the roman empire which sought vainly to stamp its national character

upon mankind the frankish monarchy the holy roman empire which

fell to pieces through the want of a central power strong enough to

overcome the tendency to separation and nationalisation and finally

the attempt of napoleon i whose mistake was the same as that

which wrecked the roman empirea neglect of the strength of foreign

national sentiment


76 reason requires a state of

nations this is the ideal and kants proposal of a federation of

states is a practical substitute from which we may work to higher

things kant like fichte werke vii 467 strongly disapproves

of a universal monarchy such as that of which dante dreameda modern

roman empire the force of necessity he says will bring nations at

last to become members of a cosmopolitan state or if such a state

of universal peace proves as has often been the case with too great

states a greater danger to freedom from another point of view in

that it introduces despotism of the most terrible kind then this

same necessity must compel the nations to enter a state which indeed

has the form not of a cosmopolitan commonwealth under one sovereign

but of a federation regulated by legal principles determined by a

common code of international law das mag in d theorie richtig

93 the difficulties in the way

of hard and fast judgments on a complicated problem of this kind

are convincingly demonstrated in a recent essay by professor d g

ritchie studies in political and social ethics sonnenschein

1902 professor ritchie considers in detail a number of concrete

cases which occurred in the century between 1770 and 1870 let any

one take the judgments he would pass on these or any similarly varied

cases and i think he will find that we do not restrict our approval

to wars of selfdefence that we do not approve selfdefence under

all circumstances that there are some cases in which we approve

of absorption of smaller states by larger that there are cases

in which we excuse intervention of third parties in quarrels with

which at first they had nothing to do and that we sometimes approve

war even when begun without the authority of any already existing

sovereign can any principles be found underlying such judgments in

the first place we ought not to disguise from ourselves the fact that

our judgments after the result are based largely on success  i

think it will be found that our judgments on the wars of the century

from 1770 to 1870 turn very largely on the question which of the

conflicting forces was making for constitutional government and for

social progress or to put it in wider terms which represented the

higher civilisation and thus it is that we may sometimes approve the

rise of a new state and sometimes the absorption of an old op

17 a new distemper has spread itself over europe it has infected

our princes and induces them to keep up an exorbitant number of

troops it has its redoublings and of necessity becomes contagious

for as soon as one prince augments what he calls his troops the

rest of course do the same so that nothing is gained thereby but

the public ruin each monarch keeps as many armies on foot as if his

people were in danger of being exterminated and they give the name

of peace to this general effort of all against all
montesquieu is of course writing in the days of

mercenary troops but the cost to the nation of our modern armies

both in time of peace and of war is incomparably greater

this danger projet art viii in the english translation of

115 it has been hitherto doubted

not without reason whether there can be laws of permission leges

permissiv of pure reason as well as commands leges prceptiv

and prohibitions leges prohibitiv for law in general has a

basis of objective practical necessity permission on the other

hand is based upon the contingency of certain actions in practice

it follows that a law of permission would enforce what cannot be

enforced and this would involve a contradiction if the object of

the law should be the same in both cases here however in the

present case of a law of permission the presupposed prohibition

is aimed merely at the future manner of acquisition of a rightfor

example acquisition through inheritance the exemption from this

prohibition ie the permission refers to the present state of

possession in the transition from a state of nature to the civil

state this holding of property can continue as a bona fide if

usurpatory ownership under the new social conditions in accordance

with a permission of the law of nature ownership of this kind as

soon as its true nature becomes known is seen to be mere nominal

possession possessio putativa sanctioned by opinion and customs

in a natural state of society after the transition stage is passed

such modes of acquisition are likewise forbidden in the subsequently

evolved civil state and this power to remain in possession would

not be admitted if the supposed acquisition had taken place in the

civilized community it would be bound to come to an end as an injury

to the right of others the moment its illegality became patent
i have wished here only by the way to draw the

attention of teachers of the law of nature to the idea of a lex

permissiva which presents itself spontaneously in any system of

rational classification i do so chiefly because use is often made

of this concept in civil law with reference to statutes with this

difference that the law of prohibition stands alone by itself

while permission is not as it ought to be introduced into that

law as a limiting clause but is thrown among the exceptions

thus this or that is forbiddensay nos 1 2 3 and so on in

an infinite progressionwhile permissions are only added to the

law incidentally they are not reached by the application of some

principle but only by groping about among cases which have actually

occurred were this not so qualifications would have had to be

brought into the formula of laws of prohibition which would have

immediately transformed them into laws of permission count von

windischgrtz a man whose wisdom was equal to his discrimination

urged this very point in the form of a question propounded by him for

a prize essay one must therefore regret that this ingenious problem

has been so soon neglected and left unsolved for the possibility of

a formula similar to those of mathematics is the sole real test of

a legislation that would be consistent without this the socalled

jus certum will remain forever a mere pious wish we can have only

general laws valid on the whole no general laws possessing the

universal validity which the concept law seems to demand


116 from this diffidence of

one another there is no way for any man to secure himself so

reasonable as anticipation that is by force or wiles to master

the persons of all men he can so long till he see no other power

great enough to endanger him and this is no more than his own

conservation requireth and is generally allowed hobbes lev i

ch xiii tr


117 hobbes thus describes the

establishment of the state a commonwealth is said to be

instituted when a multitude of men do agree and covenant

every one with every one that to whatsoever man or assembly

of men shall be given by the major part the right to present

the person of them all that is to say to be their representative

everyone as well he that voted for it as he that voted against

it shall authorize all the actions and judgments of that man or

assembly of men in the same manner as if they were his own to the

end to live peaceably amongst themselves and be protected against

other men lev ii ch xviii
there is a covenant between them as if every man

should say to every man i authorise and give up my right of

governing myself to this man or to this assembly of men on this

condition that thou give up thy right to him and authorize all his

actions in like manner lev ii ch xvii tr


118 it is usually accepted that a

man may not take hostile steps against any one unless the latter

has already injured him by act this is quite accurate if both are

citizens of a lawgoverned state for in becoming a member of this

community each gives the other the security he demands against

injury by means of the supreme authority exercising control over

them both the individual however or nation who remains in a mere

state of nature deprives me of this security and does me injury by

mere proximity there is perhaps no active facto molestation

but there is a state of lawlessness status injustus which by

its very existence offers a continual menace to me i can therefore

compel him either to enter into relations with me under which we are

both subject to law or to withdraw from my neighbourhood so that

the postulate upon which the following articles are based isall

men who have the power to exert a mutual influence upon one another

must be under a civil government of some kind
a legal constitution is according to the nature of

the individuals who compose the state 
1 a constitution formed in accordance with the right

of citizenship of the individuals who constitute a nation jus

civitatis 
2 a constitution whose principle is international

law which determines the relations of states jus gentium 
3 a constitution formed in accordance with

cosmopolitan law in as far as individuals and states standing in an

external relation of mutual reaction may be regarded as citizens of

one worldstate jus cosmopoliticum



 this classification is not an arbitrary one but

is necessary with reference to the idea of perpetual peace for if

even one of these units of society were in a position physically

to influence another while yet remaining a member of a primitive

order of society then a state of war would be joined with these

primitive conditions and from this it is our present purpose to free

ourselves


119 lawful that is to say

external freedom cannot be defined as it so often is as the

right befugniss to do whatever one likes so long as this

does not wrong anyone elseb for what is this right it is the

possibility of actions which do not lead to the injury of others so

the explanation of a right would be something like thisfreedom

is the possibility of actions which do not injure anyone a man does

not wrong anotherwhatever his actionif he does not wrong another

which is empty tautology my external lawful freedom is rather to

be explained in this way it is the right through which i require not

to obey any external laws except those to which i could have given

my consent in exactly the same way external legal equality in a

state is that relation of the subjects in consequence of which no

individual can legally bind or oblige another to anything without

at the same time submitting himself to the law which ensures that

he can in his turn be bound and obliged in like manner by this

other
the principle of lawful independence requires

no explanation as it is involved in the general concept of a

constitution the validity of this hereditary and inalienable right

which belongs of necessity to mankind is affirmed and ennobled by

the principle of a lawful relation between man himself and higher

beings if indeed he believes in such beings this is so because he

thinks of himself in accordance with these very principles as a

citizen of a transcendental world as well as of the world of sense

for as far as my freedom goes i am bound by no obligation even

with regard to divine lawswhich are apprehended by me only through

my reasonexcept in so far as i could have given my assent to them

for it is through the law of freedom of my own reason that i first

form for myself a concept of a divine will as for the principle of

equality in so far as it applies to the most sublime being in the

universe next to goda being i might perhaps figure to myself as a

mighty emanation of the divine spiritthere is no reason why if

i perform my duty in the sphere in which i am placed as that aeon

does in his the duty of obedience alone should fall to my share the

right to command to him that this principle of equality unlike

the principle of freedom does not apply to our relation to god is

due to the fact that to this being alone the idea of duty does not

belong
as for the right to equality which belongs to

all citizens as subjects the solution of the problem of the

admissibility of an hereditary nobility hinges on the following

questiondoes social rankacknowledged by the state to be higher

in the case of one subject than anotherstand above desert or does

merit take precedence of social standing now it is obvious that

if high position is combined with good family it is quite uncertain

whether merit that is to say skill and fidelity in office will

follow as well this amounts to granting the favoured individual a

commanding position without any question of desert and to that the

universal will of the peopleexpressed in an original contract which

is the fundamental principle of all rightwould never consent for it

does not follow that a nobleman is a man of noble character in the

case of the official nobility as one might term the rank of higher

magistracywhich one must acquire by meritthe social position is not

attached like property to the person but to his office and equality

is not thereby disturbed for if a man gives up office he lays

down with it his official rank and falls back into the rank of his

fellows

state of nations over vast territories must in the long run make

the government of that unionand therefore the protection of each of

its membersimpossible a multitude of such corporations will lead

again to a state of war so that perpetual peace the final goal of

international law as a whole is really an impracticable idea eine

134 in order to call this great

empire by the name which it gives itselfnamely china not sina or

a word of similar soundwe have only to look at georgii alphab

tibet pp 651654 particularly note b below according to the

observation of professor fischer of st petersburg there is really

no particular name which it always goes by the most usual is the

word kin ie gold which the inhabitants of tibet call ser

hence the emperor is called the king of gold ie the king of the

most splendid country in the world this word kin may probably be

chin in the empire itself but be pronounced kin by the italian

missionaries on account of the gutturals thus we see that the

country of the seres so often mentioned by the romans was china

the silk however was despatched to europe across greater tibet

probably through smaller tibet and bucharia through persia and

then on this leads to many reflections as to the antiquity of this

wonderful state as compared with hindustan at the time of its union

with tibet and thence with japan on the other hand the name sina

or tschina which is said to be given to this land by neighbouring

peoples leads to nothing
perhaps we can explain the ancient intercourse of

europe with tibeta fact at no time widely knownby looking at what

hesychius has preserved on the matter i refer to the shout 

 konx ompax the cry of the hierophants in the eleusinian

mysteries cf travels of anacharsis the younger part v p 447

seq for according to georgii alph tibet the word concioa

which bears a striking resemblance to konx means god pakcio

ib p 520 which might easily be pronounced by the greeks like

pax means promulgator legis the divine principle permeating

nature called also on p 177 cencresi om however which

la croze translates by benedictus ie blessed can when

applied to the deity mean nothing but beatified p 507 now p

franc horatius when he asked the lhamas of tibet as he often did

what they understood by god concioa always got the answerit

is the assembly of all the saints ie the assembly of those

blessed ones who have been born again according to the faith of the

lama and after many wanderings in changing forms have at last

returned to god to burchane that is to say they are beings to

be worshipped souls which have undergone transmigration p 223

so the mysterious expression konx ompax ought probably to mean

the holy konx blessed om and wise pax supreme being

pervading the universe the personification of nature its use in the

greek mysteries probably signified monotheism for the epoptes in

distinction from the polytheism of the people although elsewhere p

horatius scented atheism here how that mysterious word came by way

of tibet to the greeks may be explained as above and on the other

hand in this way is made probable an early intercourse of europe

with china across tibet earlier perhaps than the communication

with hindustan there is some difference of opinion as to the

meaning of the words  according to liddell and scott a

corruption of    kants inferences here seem to be

more than farfetched lobeck in his aglaophamus p 775 gives

a quite different interpretation which has he says been approved

by scholars and whately historic doubts relative to napoleon

135 in the mechanical system of

nature to which man belongs as a sentient being there appears as

the underlying ground of its existence a certain form which we

cannot make intelligible to ourselves except by thinking into the

physical world the idea of an end preconceived by the author of

the universe this predetermination of nature on the part of god

we generally call divine providence in so far as this providence

appears in the origin of the universe we speak of providence

as founder of the world providentia conditrix semel jussit

semper parent augustine as it maintains the course of nature

however according to universal laws of adaptation to preconceived

ends ie teleological laws we call it a ruling providence

providentia gubernatrix further we name it the guiding

providence providentia directrix as it appears in the world for

special ends which we could not foresee but suspect only from the

result finally regarding particular events as divine purposes

we speak no longer of providence but of dispensation directio

extraordinaria as this term however really suggests the idea of

miracles although the events are not spoken of by this name the

desire to fathom dispensation as such is a foolish presumption

in men for from one single occurrence to jump at the conclusion

that there is a particular principle of efficient causes and that

this event is an end and not merely the natural naturmechanische

sequence of a design quite unknown to us is absurd and presumptuous

in however pious and humble a spirit we may speak of it in the same

way to distinguish between a universal and a particular providence

when regarding it materialiter in its relation to actual objects

in the world to say for instance that there may be indeed a

providence for the preservation of the different species of creation

but that individuals are left to chance is false and contradictory

for providence is called universal for the very reason that no single

thing may be thought of as shut out from its care probably the

distinction of two kinds of providence formaliter or subjectively

considered had reference to the manner in which its purposes are

fulfilled so that we have ordinary providence eg the yearly

decay and awakening to new life in nature with change of season and

what we may call unusual or special providence eg the bringing

of timber by ocean currents to arctic shores where it does not

grow and where without this aid the inhabitants could not live

here although we can quite well explain the physicomechanical

cause of these phenomenain this case for example the banks of

the rivers in temperate countries are overgrown with trees some

of which fall into the water and are carried along probably by

the gulf streamwe must not overlook the teleological cause which

points to the providential care of a ruling wisdom above nature

but the concept commonly used in the schools of philosophy of a

cooperation on the part of the deity or a concurrence concursus

in the operations going on in the world of sense must be dropped

for it is firstly selfcontradictory to couple the like and the

unlike together gryphes jungere equis and to let him who is

himself the entire cause of the changes in the universe make good

any shortcomings in his own predetermining providence which to

require this must be defective during the course of the world for

example to say that the physician has restored the sick with the

help of godthat is to say that he has been present as a support for

causa solitaria non juvat god created the physician as well as his

means of healing and we must ascribe the result wholly to him if

we will go back to the supreme first cause which theoretically is

beyond our comprehension or we can ascribe the result entirely to

the physician in so far as we follow up this event as explicable

in the chain of physical causes according to the order of nature

secondly moreover such a way of looking at this question destroys

all the fixed principles by which we judge an effect but from

the ethicopractical point of view which looks entirely to the

transcendental side of things the idea of a divine concurrence is

quite proper and even necessary for example in the faith that god

will make good the imperfection of our human justice if only our

feelings and intentions are sincere and that he will do this by

means beyond our comprehension and therefore we should not slacken

our efforts after what is good whence it follows as a matter of

course that no one must attempt to explain a good action as a mere

event in time by this concursus for that would be to pretend a

theoretical knowledge of the supersensible and hence be absurd

148 these are permissive laws

of reason which allow us to leave a system of public law when it

is tainted by injustice to remain just as it is until everything

is entirely revolutionised through an internal development either

spontaneous or fostered and matured by peaceful influences for

any legal constitution whatsoever even although it conforms only

slightly with the spirit of law is better than none at allthat is

to say anarchy which is the fate of a precipitate reform hence

as things now are the wise politician will look upon it as his duty

to make reforms on the lines marked out by the ideal of public law

he will not use revolutions when these have been brought about by

natural causes to extenuate still greater oppression than caused

them but will regard them as the voice of nature calling upon him

to make such thorough reforms as will bring about the only lasting

constitution a lawful constitution based on the principles of

freedom


149 it is still sometimes

denied that we find in members of a civilised community a

certain depravity rooted in the nature of manc and it might indeed

be alleged with some show of truth that not an innate corruptness

in human nature but the barbarism of men the defect of a not yet

sufficiently developed culture is the cause of the evident antipathy

to law which their attitude indicates in the external relations of

states however human wickedness shows itself incontestably without

any attempt at concealment within the state it is covered over by

the compelling authority of civil laws for working against the

tendency every citizen has to commit acts of violence against his

neighbour there is the much stronger force of the government which

not only gives an appearance of morality to the whole state causae

non causae but by checking the outbreak of lawless propensities

actually aids the moral qualities of men considerably in their

development of a direct respect for the law for every individual

thinks that he himself would hold the idea of right sacred and

follow faithfully what it prescribes if only he could expect that

everyone else would do the same this guarantee is in part given

to him by the government and a great advance is made by this step

which is not deliberately moral towards the ideal of fidelity to

the concept of duty for its own sake without thought of return as

however every mans good opinion of himself presupposes an evil

disposition in everyone else we have an expression of their mutual

judgment of one another namely that when it comes to hard facts

none of them are worth much but whence this judgment comes remains

unexplained as we cannot lay the blame on the nature of man since

he is a being in the possession of freedom the respect for the idea

of right of which it is absolutely impossible for man to divest

himself sanctions in the most solemn manner the theory of our power

to conform to its dictates and hence every man sees himself obliged

to act in accordance with what the idea of right prescribes whether

his neighbours fulfil their obligation or not
c this depravity of human nature

is denied by rousseau who held that the mind of man was naturally

inclined to virtue and that good civil and social institutions

are all that is required discourse on the sciences and arts

153 when a king has dethroned

himself says locke on civil government ch xix  239 and

put himself in a state of war with his people what shall hinder them

from prosecuting him who is no king as they would any other man who

has put himself into a state of war with them  the legislative

being only a fiduciary power to act for certain ends there remains

still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the

legislative op cit ch xiii  149 and again op cit

ch xi  134 we find the words  over whom ie society no

body can have a power to make laws but by their own consent and by

authority received from them cf also ch xix  228 seq
hobbes represents the opposite point of view how

many kings he wrote preface to the philosophical rudiments

concerning government and society and those good men too hath

this one error that a tyrant king might lawfully be put to death

been the slaughter of how many throats hath this false position cut

that a prince for some causes may by some certain men be deposed and

what bloodshed hath not this erroneous doctrine caused that kings

are not superiors to but administrators for the multitude this

erroneous doctrine kant received from locke through rousseau he

advocated or at least practised as a citizen a doctrine of passive

obedience to the state a free press he held offered the only

lawful outlet for protest against tyranny but in theory he was an

enemy to absolute monarchy tr


154 we can find the voucher for

maxims such as these in herr hofrichter garves essay on the

connection of morals with politics 1788 this worthy scholar

confesses at the very beginning that he is unable to give a

satisfactory answer to this question but his sanction of such

maxims even when coupled with the admission that he cannot

altogether clear away the arguments raised against them seems to

be a greater concession in favour of those who shew considerable

inclination to abuse them than it might perhaps be wise to admit
