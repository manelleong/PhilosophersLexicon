<h2 id="editor">EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>There are not wanting indications that public interest
in the Critical Philosophy has been quickened
of recent days in these countries, as well as in
America. To lighten the toil of penetrating through
the wilderness of Kant’s long sentences, the English
student has now many aids, which those who
began their studies fifteen or twenty years ago did
not enjoy. Translations, paraphrases, criticisms,
have been published in considerable numbers; so
that if it is not yet true that “he who runs may
read,” it may at least be said that a patient student
of ordinary industry and intelligence has his way
made plain before him. And yet the very number
of aids is dangerous. Whatever may be the value
of short and easy handbooks in other departments of
science, it is certain that no man will become a
philosopher, no man will even acquire a satisfactory
knowledge of the history of philosophy, without
personal and prolonged study of the <i>ipsissima verba</i>
of the great masters of human thought. “Above
all,” said Schopenhauer, “my truth-seeking young
friends, beware of letting our professors tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
what is contained in the Critique of the Pure Reason”;
and the advice has not become less wholesome with
the lapse of years. The fact, however, that many
persons have not sufficient familiarity with German
to enable them to study German Philosophy in the
original with ease, makes translations an educational
necessity; and this translation of Kant’s
Critique of the faculty of Judgement has been undertaken
in the hope that it may promote a more
general study of that masterpiece. If any reader
wishes to follow Schopenhauer’s advice, he has only
to omit the whole of this prefatory matter and
proceed at once to the Author’s laborious Introduction.</p>
<p>It is somewhat surprising that the Critique of
Judgement has never yet been made accessible to
the English reader. Dr. Watson has indeed translated
a few selected passages, so also has Dr. Caird
in his valuable account of the Kantian philosophy,
and I have found their renderings of considerable
service; but the space devoted by both writers to
the Critique of Judgement is very small in comparison
with that given to the Critiques of Pure and Practical
Reason. And yet the work is not an unimportant
one. Kant himself regarded it as the coping-stone
of his critical edifice; it even formed the point of
departure for his successors, Fichte, Schelling and
Hegel, in the construction of their respective
systems. Possibly the reason of its comparative
neglect lies in its repulsive style. Kant was never
careful of style, and in his later years he became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
more and more enthralled by those technicalities
and refined distinctions which deter so many from
the Critical Philosophy even in its earlier sections.
These “symmetrical architectonic amusements,” as
Schopenhauer called them, encumber every page of
Kant’s later writings, and they are a constant source
of embarrassment to his unhappy translator. For,
as every translator knows, no single word in one
language exactly covers any single word in another;
and yet if Kant’s distinctions are to be preserved it
is necessary to select with more or less arbitrariness
English equivalents for German technical terms, and
retain them all through. Instances of this will be
given later on; I only remark here on the fact that
Kant’s besetting sin of over-technicality is especially
conspicuous in this treatise.</p>
<p>Another fault—an old fault of Kant—apparent
after reading even a few pages, is that repetitions
are very frequent of the same thought in but slightly
varied language. Arguments are repeated over and
over again until they become quite wearisome; and
then when the reader’s attention has flagged, and
he is glancing cursorily down the page, some important
new point is introduced without emphasis,
as if the author were really anxious to keep his
meaning to himself at all hazards. A book written
in such fashion rarely attracts a wide circle of
readers. And yet, not only did Goethe think
highly of it, but it received a large measure of
attention in France as well as in Germany on its
first appearance. Originally published at Berlin in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
1790, a Second Edition was called for in 1793; and
a French translation was made by Imhoff in 1796.
Other French versions are those by Keratry and
Weyland in 1823, and by Barni in 1846. This
last I have had before me while performing my
task, but I have not found it of much service; the
older French translations I have not seen. The
existence of these French versions, when taken in
connexion with the absence until very recently of
any systematic account of the Critique of Judgement
in English, may be perhaps explained by the lively
interest that was taken on the Continent in the
Philosophy of Art in the early part of the century;
whereas scientific studies on this subject received
little attention in England during the same period.</p>
<p>The student of the Critique of Pure Reason will
remember how closely, in his Transcendental Logic,
Kant follows the lines of the ordinary logic of the
schools. He finds his whole plan ready made for
him, as it were; and he proceeds to work out the
metaphysical principles which underlie the process
of syllogistic reasoning. And as there are three
propositions in every syllogism, he points out that,
in correspondence with this triplicity, the higher
faculties of the soul may be regarded as threefold.
The Understanding or the faculty of concepts
gives us our major premise, as it supplies us in
the first instance with a general notion. By means
of the Judgement we see that a particular case comes
under the general rule, and by the Reason we draw
our conclusion. These, as three distinct movements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
in the process of reasoning, are regarded
by Kant as indicating three distinct faculties, with
which the Analytic of Concepts, the Analytic of
Principles, and the Dialectic are respectively concerned.
The full significance of this important
classification does not seem, however, to have
occurred to Kant at the time, as we may see from
the order in which he wrote his great books.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">1</a> The
first problem which arrests the attention of all
modern philosophers is, of course, the problem of
knowledge, its conditions and its proper objects.
And in the Critique of Pure Reason this is discussed,
and the conclusion is reached that nature as
phenomenon is the only object of which we can
hope to acquire any exact knowledge. But it is
apparent that there are other problems which merit
consideration; a complete philosophy includes practice
as well as theory; it has to do not only with
logic, but with life. And thus the Critique of Practical
Reason was written, in which is unfolded the doctrine
of man’s freedom standing in sharp contrast with the
necessity of natural law. Here, then, it seems at
first sight as if we had covered the whole field
of human activity. For we have investigated the
sources of knowledge, and at the same time have
pointed out the conditions of practical life, and have
seen that the laws of freedom are just as true in
their own sphere as are the laws of nature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
But as we reflect on our mental states we find
that here no proper account has been given of the
phenomena of <i>feeling</i>, which play so large a part
in experience. And this Kant saw before he had
proceeded very far with the Critique of Practical
Reason; and in consequence he adopted a threefold
classification of the higher mental faculties based on
that given by previous psychologists. Knowledge,
feeling, desire, these are the three ultimate modes
of consciousness, of which the second has not yet
been described. And when we compare this with
the former triple division which we took up from
the Aristotelian logic, we see that the parallelism
is significant. Understanding is <i>par excellence</i> the
faculty of knowledge, and Reason the faculty of
desire (these points are developed in Kant’s
first two Critiques). And this suggests that the
Judgement corresponds to the feeling of pleasure
and pain; it occupies a position intermediate between
Understanding and Reason, just as, roughly
speaking, the feeling of pleasure is intermediate
between our perception of an object and our desire
to possess it.</p>
<p>And so the Critique of Judgement completes the
whole undertaking of criticism; its endeavour is to
show that there are <i>a priori</i> principles at the basis
of Judgement just as there are in the case of Understanding
and of Reason; that these principles, like
the principles of Reason, are not constitutive but
only regulative of experience, <i>i.e.</i> that they do not
teach us anything positive about the characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
of objects, but only indicate the conditions under
which we find it necessary to view them; and
lastly, that we are thus furnished with an <i>a priori</i>
philosophy of pleasure.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle underlying the procedure
of the Judgement is seen to be that of the
purposiveness of Nature; nature is everywhere
adapted to ends or purposes, and thus constitutes
a <span lang="grc">κόσμος</span>, a well-ordered whole. By this means,
nature is regarded by us as if its particular empirical
laws were not isolated and disparate, but connected
and in relation, deriving their unity in seeming
diversity from an intelligence which is at the source
of nature. It is only by the assumption of such a
principle that we can construe nature to ourselves;
and the principle is then said to be a transcendental
condition of the exercise of our judging faculty, but
valid only for the reflective, not for the determinant
Judgement. It gives us pleasure to view nature in
this way; just as the contemplation of chaos would
be painful.</p>
<p>But this purposiveness may be only formal and
subjective, or real and objective. In some cases
the purposiveness resides in the felt harmony and
accordance of the form of the object with the cognitive
faculties; in others the form of the object is
judged to harmonise with the purpose in view in its
existence. That is to say, in the one case we judge
the form of the object to be purposive, as in the
case of a flower, but could not explain any purpose
served by it; in the other case we have a definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
notion of what it is adapted for. In the former case
the aesthetical Judgement is brought to bear, in the
latter the teleological; and it thus appears that the
Critique of Judgement has two main divisions; it
treats first of the philosophy of Taste, the Beautiful
and the Sublime in Nature; and secondly, of the
Teleology of nature’s working. It is a curious
literary parallel that St. Augustine hints (<i>Confessions</i>
iv. 15) that he had written a book, <i>De Pulchro
et Ápto</i>, in which these apparently distinct topics
were combined; “pulchrum esse, quod per se
ipsum; aptum, autem, quod ad aliquid accommodatum
deceret.” A beautiful object has no
purpose external to itself and the observer; but a
useful object serves further ends. Both, however,
may be brought under the higher category of things
that are reckoned <i>purposive</i> by the Judgement.</p>
<p>We have here then, in the first place, a basis for
an <i>a priori</i> Philosophy of Taste; and Kant works
out its details with great elaboration. He borrowed
little from the writings of his predecessors, but
struck out, as was ever his plan, a line of his own.
He quotes with approval from Burke’s <i>Treatise on
the Sublime and Beautiful</i>, which was accessible to
him in a German translation; but is careful to
remark that it is as psychology, not as philosophy,
that Burke’s work has value. He may have read
in addition Hutcheson’s <i>Inquiry</i> which had also
been translated into German; and he was complete
master of Hume’s opinions. Of other writers on
Beauty, he only names Batteux and Lessing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
Batteux was a French writer of repute who had
attempted a twofold arrangement of the Arts as
they may be brought under Space and under Time
respectively, a mode of classification which would
naturally appeal to Kant. He does not seem,
however, to have read the ancient text-book
on the subject, Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i>, the principles
of which Lessing declared to be as certain as
Euclid.</p>
<p>Following the guiding thread of the categories, he
declares that the aesthetical judgement about Beauty
is according to <i>quality</i> disinterested; a point which
had been laid down by such different writers
as Hutcheson and Moses Mendelssohn. As to
<i>quantity</i>, the judgement about beauty gives universal
satisfaction, although it is based on no definite
concept. The universality is only subjective; but
still it is there. The maxim <i>Trahit sua quemque
voluptas</i> does not apply to the pleasure afforded by
a pure judgement about beauty. As to <i>relation</i>, the
characteristic of the object called beautiful is that it
betrays a purposiveness without definite purpose.
The pleasure is <i>a priori</i>, independent on the one
hand of the charms of sense or the emotions of mere
feeling, as Winckelmann had already declared; and
on the other hand is a pleasure quite distinct from
that taken which we feel when viewing perfection,
with which Wolff and Baumgarten had identified it.
By his distinction between free and dependent
beauty, which we also find in the pages of Hutcheson,
Kant further develops his doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
freedom of the pure judgement of taste from the
thraldom of concepts.</p>
<p>Finally, the satisfaction afforded by the contemplation
of a beautiful object is a necessary satisfaction.
This necessity is not, to be sure, theoretical like the
necessity attaching to the Law of Causality; nor is it a
practical necessity as is the need to assume the Moral
Law as the guiding principle of conduct. But it may
be called <i>exemplary</i>; that is, we may set up our satisfaction
in a beautiful picture as setting an example
to be followed by others. It is plain, however, that
this can only be assumed under certain presuppositions.
We must presuppose the idea of a <i>sensus communis</i>
or common sense in which all men share. As
knowledge admits of being communicated to others,
so also does the feeling for beauty. For the relation
between the cognitive faculties requisite for Taste
is also requisite for Intelligence or sound Understanding,
and as we always presuppose the latter to
be the same in others as in ourselves, so may we
presuppose the former.</p>
<p>The analysis of the Sublime which follows that
of the Beautiful is interesting and profound; indeed
Schopenhauer regarded it as the best part of the
Critique of the Aesthetical Judgement. The general
characteristics of our judgements about the Sublime
are similar to those already laid down in the case
of the Beautiful; but there are marked differences
in the two cases. If the pleasure taken in beauty
arises from a feeling of the purposiveness of the
object in its relation to the subject, that in sublimity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
rather expresses a purposiveness of the subject in
respect of the object. Nothing in nature is sublime;
and the sublimity really resides in the mind
and there alone. Indeed, as true Beauty is found,
properly speaking, only in beauty of form, the idea
of sublimity is excited rather by those objects which
are formless and exhibit a violation of purpose.</p>
<p>A distinction not needed in the case of the
Beautiful becomes necessary when we proceed to
further analyse the Sublime. For in aesthetical
judgements about the Beautiful the mind is in <i>restful</i>
contemplation; but in the case of the Sublime a
mental <i>movement</i> is excited (pp. 105 and 120). This
movement, as it is pleasing, must involve a purposiveness
in the harmony of the mental powers; and the
purposiveness may be either in reference to the faculty
of cognition or to that of desire. In the former case
the sublime is called the Mathematically Sublime—the
sublime of mere magnitude—the absolutely great; in
the latter it is the sublime of power, the Dynamically
Sublime. Gioberti, an Italian writer on the philosophy
of Taste, has pushed this distinction so far as
to find in it an explanation of the relation between
Beauty and Sublimity. “The dynamical Sublime,”
he says, “creates the Beautiful; the mathematical
Sublime contains it,” a remark with which probably
Kant would have no quarrel.</p>
<p>In both cases, however, we find that the feeling
of the Sublime awakens in us a feeling of
the supersensible destination of man. “The very
capacity of conceiving the sublime,” he tells us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
“indicates a mental faculty that far surpasses
every standard of sense.” And to explain the
necessity belonging to our judgements about the
sublime, Kant points out that as we find ourselves
compelled to postulate a <i>sensus communis</i> to account
for the agreement of men in their appreciation of
beautiful objects, so the principle underlying their
consent in judging of the sublime is “the presupposition
of the moral feeling in man.” The feeling
of the sublimity of our own moral destination is the
necessary prerequisite for forming such judgements.
The connexion between Beauty and Goodness involved
to a Greek in the double sense of the word
<span lang="grc">καλόν</span> is developed by Kant with keen insight. To
feel interest in the beauty of Nature he regards
as a mark of a moral disposition, though he will not
admit that the same inference may be drawn as
to the character of the art connoisseur (§ 42). But
it is specially with reference to the connexion between
the capacity for appreciating the Sublime, and
the moral feeling, that the originality of Kant’s treatment
becomes apparent.</p>
<p>The objects of nature, he continues, which we
call sublime, inspire us with a feeling of pain rather
than of pleasure; as Lucretius has <span class="locked">it—</span></p>
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Me quaedam divina voluptas<br></span>
<span class="i0">Percipit atque horror.<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>But this “horror” must not inspire actual fear.
As no extraneous charm must mingle with the
satisfaction felt in a beautiful object, if the judgement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
about beauty is to remain pure; so in the
case of the sublime we must not be afraid of the
object which yet in certain aspects is fearful.</p>
<p>This conception of the feelings of sublimity
excited by the loneliness of an Alpine peak or the
grandeur of an earthquake is now a familiar one;
but it was not so in Kant’s day. Switzerland had
not then become the recreation-ground of Europe;
and though natural beauty was a familiar topic with
poets and painters it was not generally recognised
that taste has also to do with the sublime. De
Saussure’s <i>Travels</i>, Haller’s poem <i>Die Alpen</i>, and
this work of Kant’s mark the beginning of a new
epoch in our ways of looking at the sublime and
terrible aspects of Nature. And it is not a little
remarkable that the man who could write thus
feelingly about the emotions inspired by grand and
savage scenery, had never seen a mountain in
his life. The power and the insight of his
observations here are in marked contrast to the
poverty of some of his remarks about the characteristics
of beauty. For instance, he puts forward the
curious doctrine that colour in a picture is only an
extraneous charm, and does not really add to the
beauty of the form delineated, nay rather distracts
the mind from it. His criticisms on this point, if
sound, would make Flaxman a truer artist than
Titian or Paolo Veronese. But indeed his discussion
of Painting or Music is not very appreciative; he
was, to the end, a creature of pure Reason.</p>
<p>Upon the analysis he gives of the Arts, little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
need be said here. Fine Art is regarded as the
Art of Genius, “that innate mental disposition
through which Nature gives the rule to Art” (§ 46).
Art differs from Science in the absence of definite
concepts in the mind of the artist. It thus happens
that the great artist can rarely communicate his
methods; indeed he cannot explain them even to
himself. <i>Poeta nascitur, non fit</i>; and the same is
true in every form of fine art. Genius is, in short,
the faculty of presenting aesthetical Ideas; an
aesthetical Idea being an intuition of the Imagination,
to which no concept is adequate. And it
is by the excitation of such ineffable Ideas that a
great work of art affects us. As Bacon tells us,
“that is the best part of Beauty which a picture
cannot express; no, nor the first sight of the eye.”
This characteristic of the artistic genius has been
noted by all who have thought upon art; more is
present in its productions than can be perfectly
expressed in language. As Pliny said of Timanthus
the painter of Iphigenia, “In omnibus ejus operibus
intelligitur plus super quam pingitur.” But this
genius requires to be kept in check by taste; quite
in the spirit of the <span lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</span> of the best Greek art,
Kant remarks that if in a work of art some feature
must be sacrificed, it is better to lose something of
genius than to violate the canons of taste. It is in
this self-mastery that “the sanity of true genius”
expresses itself.</p>
<p>The main question with which the Critique of
Judgement is concerned is, of course, the question as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
to the purposiveness, the <i>Zweckmässigkeit</i>, exhibited
by nature. That nature appears to be full of
purpose is mere matter of fact. It displays purposiveness
in respect of our faculties of cognition,
in those of its phenomena which we designate
beautiful. And also in its organic products we
observe methods of operation which we can only
explain by describing them as processes in which
means are used to accomplish certain ends, as
processes that are <i>purposive</i>. In our observation
of natural phenomena, as Kuno Fischer puts it, we
judge their <i>forms</i> aesthetically, and their <i>life</i> teleologically.</p>
<p>As regards the first kind of <i>Zweckmässigkeit</i>,
that which is <i>ohne Zweck</i>—the purposiveness of a
beautiful object which does not seem to be directed
to any external end—there are two ways in which we
may account for it. We may either say that it was
actually designed to be beautiful by the Supreme
Force behind Nature, or we may say that purposiveness
is not really resident in nature, but that our
perception of it is due to the subjective needs of our
judging faculty. We have to contemplate beautiful
objects <i>as if</i> they were purposive, but they may not
be so in reality. And this latter idealistic doctrine is
what Kant falls back upon. He appeals in support
of it, to the phenomena of crystallisation (pp. 243
<i>sqq.</i>), in which many very beautiful forms seem
to be produced by merely mechanical processes.
The beauty of a rock crystal is apparently produced
without any forethought on the part of nature, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
he urges that we are not justified in asserting
dogmatically that any laws distinct from those of
mechanism are needed to account for beauty in
other cases. Mechanism can do so much; may it
not do all? And he brings forward as a consideration
which ought to settle the question, the fact that
in judging of beauty “we invariably seek its gauge
<i>in ourselves a priori</i>”; we do not learn from nature,
but from ourselves, what we are to find beautiful.
Mr. Kennedy in his Donnellan Lectures has here
pointed out several weak spots in Kant’s armour. In
the first place, the fact that we seek the gauge of
beauty in our own mind “may be shown from his
own definition to be a necessary result of the very
nature of beauty.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2">2</a> For Kant tells us that the
aesthetical judgement about beauty always involves
“a reference of the representation to the subject”;
and this applies equally to judgements about the
beautiful in Art and the beautiful in Nature. But
no one could maintain that from this definition it
follows that we are not compelled to postulate design
in the mind of the artist who paints a beautiful
picture. And thus as the fact that “we always seek
the gauge of beauty” in ourselves does not do away
with the belief in a designing mind when we are
contemplating works of art, it cannot be said to
exclude the belief in a Master Hand which moulded
the forms of Nature. As Cicero has it, nature is
“non artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex.” But the
cogency of this reasoning, for the details of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
I must refer the reader to Mr. Kennedy’s pages,
becomes more apparent when we reflect on that
second form of purposiveness, viz. adaptation to
definite ends, with which we meet in the phenomena
of organic life.</p>
<p>If we watch, <i>e.g.</i> the growth of a tree we perceive
that its various parts are not isolated and
unconnected, but that on the contrary they are only
possible by reference to the idea of the whole. Each
limb affects every other, and is reciprocally affected by
it; in short “in such a product of nature every part not
only exists <i>by means of</i> the other parts, but is thought
as existing <i>for the sake of</i> the others and the whole”
(p. 277). The operations of nature in organised
bodies seem to be of an entirely different character
from mere mechanical processes; we cannot construe
them to ourselves except under the hypothesis that
nature in them is working towards a designed end.
The distinction between nature’s “Technic” or
purposive operation, and nature’s Mechanism is
fundamental for the explanation of natural law.
The language of biology eloquently shows the
impossibility of eliminating at least the <i>idea</i> of
purpose from our investigations into the phenomena
of life, growth, and reproduction. And Kant dismisses
with scant respect that cheap and easy
philosophy which would fain deny the distinctiveness
of nature’s purposive operation. A doctrine,
like that of Epicurus, in which every natural phenomenon
is regarded as the result of the blind drifting
of atoms in accordance with purely mechanical laws,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
really explains nothing, and least of all explains
that illusion in our teleological judgements which
leads us to assume purpose where really there is
none.</p>
<p>It has been urged by Kirchmann and others that
this distinction between Technic and Mechanism,
on which Kant lays so much stress, has been disproved
by the progress of modern science. The
doctrines, usually associated with the name of
Darwin, of Natural Selection and Survival of the
Fittest, quite sufficiently explain, it is said, on
mechanical principles the semblance of purpose with
which nature mocks us. The presence of order is
not due to any purpose behind the natural operation,
but to the inevitable disappearance of the disorderly.
It would be absurd, of course, to claim for Kant
that he anticipated the Darwinian doctrines of
development; and yet passages are not wanting in
his writings in which he takes a view of the continuity
of species with which modern science would
have little fault to find. “Nature organises itself
and its organised products in every species, no
doubt after one general pattern but yet with suitable
deviations, which self-preservation demands according
to circumstances” (p. 279). “The analogy of
forms, which with all their differences seem to have
been produced according to a common original type,
strengthens our suspicions of an actual relationship
between them in their production from a common
parent, through the gradual approximation of one
animal genus to another—from those in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
principle of purposes seems to be best authenticated,
<i>i.e.</i> from man, down to the polype and again from
this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to crude
matter. And so the whole Technic of nature, which
is so incomprehensible to us in organised beings
that we believe ourselves compelled to think a
different principle for it, seems to be derived from
matter and its powers according to mechanical laws
(like those by which it works in the formation of
crystals)” (p. 337). Such a theory he calls “a daring
venture of reason,” and its coincidences with modern
science are real and striking. But he is careful to
add that such a theory, even if established, would
not eliminate purpose from the universe; it would
indeed suggest that certain special processes having
the semblance of purpose may be elucidated on
mechanical principles, but on the whole, purposive
operation on the part of Mother Nature it would
still be needful to assume (p. 338). “No finite
Reason can hope to understand the production of
even a blade of grass by mere mechanical causes”
(p. 326). “It is absurd to hope that another Newton
will arise in the future who shall make comprehensible
by us the production of a blade of grass
according to natural laws which no design has
ordered” (p. 312).</p>
<p>Crude materialism thus affording no explanation
of the purposiveness in nature, we go on to ask
what other theories are logically possible. We may
dismiss at once the doctrine of Hylozoism, according
to which the purposes in nature are explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>
in reference to a world-soul, which is the inner
principle of the material universe and constitutes its
life. For such a doctrine is self-contradictory, inasmuch
as lifelessness, <i>inertia</i>, is the essential characteristic
of matter, and to talk of living matter is
absurd (p. 304). A much more plausible system is
that of Spinoza, who aimed at establishing the ideality
of the principle of natural purposes. He regarded
the world whole as a complex of manifold determinations
inhering in a single simple substance; and
thus reduced our concepts of the purposive in nature
to our own consciousness of existing in an all-embracing
Being. But on reflection we see that this
does not so much explain as explain away the purposiveness
of nature; it gives us an unity of inherence
<i>in</i> one Substance, but not an unity of causal
dependence <i>on</i> one Substance (p. 303). And this
latter would be necessary in order to explain the
unity of purpose which nature exhibits in its phenomenal
working. Spinozism, therefore, does not give
what it pretends to give; it puts us off with a vague
and unfruitful unity of ground, when what we seek
is a unity that shall itself contain the causes of the
differences manifest in nature.</p>
<p>We have left then as the only remaining possible
doctrine, Theism, which represents natural purposes
as produced in accordance with the Will and Design
of an Intelligent Author and Governor of Nature.
This theory is, in the first place, “superior to all
other grounds of explanation” (p. 305), for it gives
a full solution of the problem before us and enables<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>
us to maintain the reality of the <i>Zweckmässigkeit</i> of
nature. “Teleology finds the consummation of its
investigations only in Theology” (p. 311). To represent
the world and the natural purposes therein
as produced by an intelligent Cause is “completely
satisfactory from every human point of view for
both the speculative and practical use of our Reason”
(p. 312). Thus the contemplation of natural purposes,
<i>i.e.</i> the common Argument from Design,
enables us to reach a highest Understanding as
Cause of the world “in accordance with the principles
of the reflective Judgement, <i>i.e.</i> <i>in accordance with the
constitution of our human faculty of cognition</i>” (p.
416).</p>
<p>It is in this qualifying clause that Kant’s negative
attitude in respect of Theism betrays itself.
He regards it as a necessary assumption for the
guidance of scientific investigation, no less than for
the practical needs of morals; but he does not
admit that we can claim for it objective validity.
In the language of the Critique of Pure Reason, the
Idea of God furnishes a regulative, not a constitutive
principle of Reason; or as he prefers to put it in the
present work, it is valid only for the reflective, not
for the determinant Judgement. We are not justified,
Kant maintains, in asserting dogmatically that God
exists; there is only permitted to us the limited
formula “We cannot otherwise conceive the purposiveness
which must lie at the basis of our cognition
of the internal possibility of many natural things,
than by representing it and the world in general as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
produced by an intelligent cause, <i>i.e.</i> a God” (p.
312).</p>
<p>We ask then, whence arises this impossibility of
objective statement? It is in the true Kantian
spirit to assert that no synthetical proposition can
be made with reference to what lies above and
behind the world of sense; but there is a difficulty
in carrying out this principle into details. Kant’s
refusal to infer a designing Hand behind the apparent
order of nature is based, he tells us, on the fact
that the concept of a “natural purpose” is one that
cannot be justified to the speculative Reason. For
all we know it may only indicate our way of looking
at things, and may point to no corresponding objective
reality. That we are forced by the limited
nature of our faculties to view nature as working
towards ends, as purposive, does not prove that it is
really so. We cannot justify such pretended insight
into what is behind the veil.</p>
<p>It is to be observed, however, that precisely
similar arguments might be urged against our
affirmation of purpose, design, will, as the spring of
the actions of other human beings.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3" id="FNanchor_3">3</a> For let us
consider why it is that, mind being assumed as the
basis of our own individual consciousness, we go on
to attribute minds of like character to other men.
We see that the external behaviour of other men is
similar to our own, and that the most reasonable
way of accounting for such behaviour is to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>
that they have minds like ourselves, that they are
possessed of an active and spontaneously energising
faculty, which is the seat of their personality. But
it is instructive to observe that neither on Kantian
principles nor on any other can we <i>demonstrate</i>
this; to cross the chasm which separates one man’s
personality from another’s requires a venture of
faith just as emphatically as any theological formula.
I can by no means <i>prove</i> to the determinant Judgement
that the complex of sensations which I constantly
experience, and which I call the Prime
Minister, is anything more than a well-ordered
machine. It is improbable that this is the case—highly
improbable; but the falsity of such an hypothesis
cannot be proved in the same way that we
would prove the falsity of the assertion that two
and two make five. But then though the hypothesis
cannot be thus ruled out of court by demonstration
of its absurdity, it is not the simplest
hypothesis, nor is it that one which best accounts
for the facts. The assumption, on the other hand,
that the men whom I meet every day have minds
like my own, perfectly accounts for all the facts, and
is a very simple assumption. It merely extends by
induction the sphere of a force which I already know
to exist. Or in other words, crude materialism not
giving me an intelligent account of my own individual
consciousness, I recognise mind, <span lang="grc">νοῦς</span>, as a <i>vera
causa</i>, as something which really does produce effects
in the field of experience, and which therefore I may
legitimately put forward as the cause of those actions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>
of other men which externally so much resemble my
own. But, as has been said before, this argument,
though entirely convincing to any sane person, is not
demonstrative; in Kantian language and on Kantian
principles the reasoning here used would seem to be
valid only for the reflective and not for the determinant
Judgement. If the principle of design or
conscious adaptation of means to ends be not a
constitutive principle of experience, but only a
regulative principle introduced to account for the
facts, what right have we to put it forward dogmatically
as affording an explanation of the actions
of other human beings?</p>
<p>It cannot be said that Kant’s attempted answer
to such a defence of the Design Argument is quite
conclusive. In § 90 of the <i>Methodology</i> (p. 399) he
pleads that though it is perfectly legitimate to argue
by analogy from our own minds to the minds of
other men,—nay further, although we may conclude
from those actions of the lower animals which
display plan, that they are not, as Descartes alleged,
mere machines—yet it is not legitimate to conclude
from the apparent presence of design in the operations
of nature that a conscious mind directs those
operations. For, he argues, that in comparing the
actions of men and the lower animals, or in comparing
the actions of one man with those of another, we are
not pressing our analogy beyond the limits of experience.
Men and beasts alike are finite living beings,
subject to the limitations of finite existence; and
hence the law which governs the one series of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>
operations may be regarded by analogy as sufficiently
explaining the other series. But the power
at the basis of Nature is utterly above definition
or comprehension, and we are going beyond our
legitimate province if we venture to ascribe to it a
mode of operation with which we are only conversant
in the case of beings subject to the conditions of
space and time. He urges in short that when
speaking about man and his mind we thoroughly
understand what we are talking about; but in
speaking of the Mind of Deity we are dealing with
something of which we have no experience, and of
which therefore we have no right to predicate anything.</p>
<p>But it is apparent that, as has been pointed out,
even when we infer the existence of another finite
mind from certain observed operations, we are
making an inference about something which is as
mysterious an <i>x</i> as anything can be. Mind is not a
thing that is subject to the laws and conditions of
the world of sense; it is “<i>in</i> the world but not <i>of</i>
the world.” And so to infer the existence of the
mind of any individual except myself is a quite
different kind of inference from that by which, for
example, we infer the presence of an electro-magnet
in a given field. The action of the latter we understand
to a large extent; but we do not understand
the action of mind, which yet we know from daily
experience of ourselves does produce effects in the
phenomenal world, often permanent and important
effects. Briefly, the action of mind upon matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>
(to use the ordinary phraseology for the sake of
clearness) is—we may assume for our present purpose—an
established fact. Hence the causality of
mind is a <i>vera causa</i>; we bring it in to account for
the actions of other human beings, and by precisely
the same process of reasoning we invoke it to
explain the operations of nature.</p>
<p>And it is altogether beside the point to urge, as
Kant does incessantly, that in the latter case the intelligence
inferred is <i>infinite</i>; in the former only <i>finite</i>.
All that the Design Argument undertakes to prove
is that mind lies at the basis of nature. It is quite
beyond its province to say whether this mind is
finite or infinite; and thus Kant’s criticisms on
p. 364 are somewhat wide of the mark. There is
always a difficulty in any argument which tries to
establish the operation of mind anywhere, for mind
cannot be seen or touched or felt; but the difficulty
is not peculiar to that particular form of argument
with which theological interests are involved.</p>
<p>The real plausibility of this objection arises from
a vague idea, often present to us when we speak of
<i>infinite</i> wisdom or <i>infinite</i> intelligence, namely that
the epithet <i>infinite</i> in some way alters the meaning
of the attributes to which it is applied. But the
truth is that the word <i>infinite</i>, when applied to
wisdom or knowledge or any other intellectual or
moral quality, can only properly have reference to
the number of acts of wisdom or knowledge that we
suppose to have been performed. The only sense
in which we have any right to speak of <i>infinite</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>
wisdom is that it is that which performs an infinite
number of wise acts. And so when we speak of
infinite <i>intelligence</i>, we have not the slightest warrant,
either in logic or in common sense, for supposing
that such intelligence is not similar in kind to that
finite intelligence which we know in man.</p>
<p>To understand Kant’s attitude fully, we must
also take into consideration the great weight that
he attaches to the Moral Argument for the existence
of God. The positive side of his teaching
on Theism is summed up in the following
sentence (p. 388): “For the theoretical reflective
Judgement physical Teleology sufficiently proves
from the purposes of Nature an intelligent world-cause;
for the practical Judgement moral Teleology
establishes it by the concept of a final purpose,
which it is forced to ascribe to creation.” That
side of his system which is akin to Agnosticism
finds expression in his determined refusal to admit
anything more than this. The existence of God is
for him a “thing of faith”; and is not a fact of knowledge,
strictly so called. “Faith” he holds (p. 409)
“is the moral attitude of Reason as to belief in
that which is unattainable by theoretical cognition.
It is therefore the constant principle of the mind
to assume as true that which it is necessary to presuppose
as condition of the possibility of the highest
moral final purpose.” As he says elsewhere (Introduction
to Logic, ix. p. 60), “That man is morally
<i>unbelieving</i> who does not accept that which, though
<i>impossible</i> to know, is <i>morally necessary</i> to suppose.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>
And as far as he goes a Theist may agree with
him, and he has done yeoman’s service to Theism
by his insistence on the absolute impossibility of any
other working hypothesis as an explanation of the
phenomena of nature. But I have endeavoured to
indicate at what points he does not seem to me to
have gone as far as even his own declared principles
would justify him in going. If the existence of a
Supreme Mind be a “thing of faith,” this may with
equal justice be said of the finite minds of the men
all around us; and his attempt to show that the
argument from analogy is here without foundation is
not convincing.</p>
<p>Kant, however, in the Critique of Judgement is
sadly fettered by the chains that he himself had
forged, and frequently chafes under the restraints
they impose. He indicates more than once a point of
view higher than that of the Critique of Pure Reason,
from which the phenomena of life and mind may be
contemplated. He had already hinted in that work
that the supersensible substrate of the ego and the
non-ego might be identical. “Both kinds of objects
differ from each other, not internally, but only so far
as the one <i>appears</i> external to the other; possibly
what is at the basis of phenomenal matter as a thing
in itself may not be so heterogeneous after all as we
imagine.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4" id="FNanchor_4">4</a> This hypothesis which remains a bare
undeveloped possibility in the earlier work is put
forward as a positive doctrine in the Critique of Judgement.
“There must,” says Kant, “be a ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>
of the <i>unity</i> of the supersensible, which lies at the
basis of nature, with that which the concept of
freedom practically contains” (Introduction, p. 13).
That is to say, he maintains that to explain the
phenomena of organic life and the purposiveness of
nature we must hold that the world of sense is not
disparate from and opposed to the world of thought,
but that <i>nature is the development of freedom</i>. The
connexion of nature and freedom is suggested by,
nay is involved in, the notion of natural adaptation;
and although we can arrive at no knowledge of the
supersensible substrate of both, yet such a common
ground there must be. This principle is the starting-point
of the systems which followed that of Kant;
and the philosophy of later Idealism is little more
than a development of the principle in its consequences.</p>
<p>He approaches the same doctrine by a different
path in the Critique of the Teleological Judgement
(§ 77), where he argues that the distinction between
the mechanical and the teleological working of
nature, upon which so much stress has been justly
laid, depends for its validity upon the peculiar character
of our Understanding. When we give what
may be called a mechanical elucidation of any
natural phenomenon, we begin with its parts, and
from what we know of them we explain the whole.
But in the case of certain objects, <i>e.g.</i> organised
bodies, this cannot be done. In their case we can
only account for the parts by a reference to the
whole. Now, were it possible for us to perceive a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl">xl</a></span>
whole before its parts and derive the latter from the
former,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5" id="FNanchor_5">5</a> then an organism would be capable of being
understood and would be an object of knowledge in
the strictest sense. But our Understanding is not
able to do this, and its inadequacy for such a task
leads us to conceive the possibility of an Understanding,
not discursive like ours, but intuitive, for
which knowledge of the whole would precede that
of the parts. “It is at least possible to consider the
material world as mere phenomenon, and to think
as its substrate something like a thing in itself
(which is not phenomenon), and to attach to this
a corresponding intellectual intuition. Thus there
would be, although incognisable by us, a supersensible
real ground for nature, to which we ourselves belong”
(p. 325). Hence, although Mechanism and
Technic must not be confused and must ever stand
side by side in our scientific investigation of natural
law, yet must they be regarded as coalescing in a
single higher principle incognisable by us. The
ground of union is “the supersensible substrate of
nature of which we can determine nothing positively,
except that it is the being in itself of which we
merely know the phenomenon.” Thus, then, it
appears that the whole force of Kant’s main argument
has proceeded upon an assumption, viz. the
permanent opposition between Sense and Understanding,
which the progress of the argument has
shown to be unsound. “Kant seems,” says Goethe,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6" id="FNanchor_6">6</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli">xli</a></span>
“to have woven a certain element of irony into his
method. For, while at one time he seemed to be
bent on limiting our faculties of knowledge in the
narrowest way, at another time he pointed, as it
were with a side gesture, beyond the limits which
he himself had drawn.” The fact of adaptation of
means to ends observable in nature seems to break
down the barrier between Nature and Freedom;
and if we once relinquish the distinction between
Mechanism and Technic in the operations of nature
we are led to the Idea of an absolute Being, who
manifests Himself by action which, though necessary,
is yet the outcome of perfect freedom.</p>
<p>Kant, however, though he approaches such a
position more than once, can never be said to have
risen to it. He deprecates unceasingly the attempt
to combine principles of nature with the principles
of freedom as a task beyond the modest capacity of
human reason; and while strenuously insisting on
the practical force of the Moral Argument for the
Being of God, which is found in the witness of
man’s conscience, will not admit that it can in any
way be regarded as strengthening the theoretical
arguments adduced by Teleology. The two
lines of proof, he holds, are quite distinct; and
nothing but confusion and intellectual disaster can
result from the effort to combine them. The moral
proof stands by itself, and it needs no such crutches
as the argument from Design can offer. But, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii">xlii</a></span>
Mr. Kennedy has pointed out in his acute criticism<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7" id="FNanchor_7">7</a>
of the Kantian doctrine of Theism, it would not be
possible to combine a theoretical <i>disbelief</i> in God
with a frank acceptance of the practical belief of
His existence borne in upon us by the Moral Law.
Kant himself admits this: “A dogmatical <i>unbelief</i>,”
he says (p. 411), “cannot subsist together with a
moral maxim dominant in the mental attitude.”
That is, though the theoretical argument be incomplete,
we cannot reject the conclusion to which it
leads, for this is confirmed by the moral necessities
of conscience.</p>
<p>Kant’s position, then, seems to come to this,
that though he never doubts the existence of
God, he has very grave doubts that He can be
theoretically known by man. <i>That</i> He is, is certain;
<i>what</i> He is, we cannot determine. It is a position
not dissimilar to current Agnostic doctrines; and as
long as the antithesis between Sense and Understanding,
between Matter and Mind, is insisted
upon as expressing a real and abiding truth, Kant’s
reasoning can hardly be refuted with completeness.
No doubt it may be urged that since the practical
and theoretical arguments both arrive at the same
conclusion, the cogency of our reasoning in the
latter should confirm our trust in the former. But
true conclusions may sometimes seem to follow
from quite insufficient premises; and Kant is thus
justified in demanding that each argument shall
be submitted to independent tests. I have endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii">xliii</a></span>
to show above that he has not treated
the theoretical line of reasoning quite fairly, and that
he has underestimated its force; but its value <i>as an
argument</i> is not increased by showing that another
entirely different process of thought leads to the
same result. And that the witness of conscience
affords the most powerful and convincing argument
for the existence of a Supreme Being, the source of
law as of love, is a simple matter of experience.
Induction, syllogism, analogy, do not really generate
belief in God, though they may serve to justify to
reason a faith that we already possess. The poet
has the truth of it:</p>

<p>I give at the end of this Introduction a Glossary
of the chief philosophical terms used by Kant; I
have tried to render them by the same English
equivalents all through the work, in order to preserve,
as far as may be, the exactness of expression
in the original. I am conscious that this makes the
translation clumsy in many places, but have thought
it best to sacrifice elegance to precision. This
course is the more necessary to adopt, as Kant
cannot be understood unless his nice verbal distinctions
be attended to. Thus <i>real</i> means quite a
different thing from <i>wirklich</i>; <i>Hang</i> from <i>Neigung</i>;
<i>Rührung</i> from <i>Affekt</i> or <i>Leidenschaft</i>; <i>Anschauung</i>
from <i>Empfindung</i> or <i>Wahrnehmung</i>; <i>Endzweck</i> from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv">xliv</a></span>
<i>letzter Zweck</i>; <i>Idee</i> from <i>Vorstellung</i>; <i>Eigenschaft</i>
from <i>Attribut</i> or <i>Beschaffenheit</i>; <i>Schranke</i> from
<i>Grenze</i>; <i>überreden</i> from <i>überzeugen</i>, etc. I am not
satisfied with “gratification” and “grief” as the
English equivalents for <i>Vergnügen</i> and <i>Schmerz</i>; but
it is necessary to distinguish these words from <i>Lust</i>
and <i>Unlust</i>, and “mental pleasure,” “mental pain,”
which would nearly hit the sense, are awkward.
Again, the constant rendering of <i>schön</i> by beautiful
involves the expression “beautiful art” instead of the
more usual phrase “fine art.” <i>Purposive</i> is an ugly
word, but it has come into use lately; and its employment
enables us to preserve the connexion between
<i>Zweck</i> and <i>zweckmässig</i>. I have printed <i>Judgement</i>
with a capital letter when it signifies the <i>faculty</i>,
with a small initial when it signifies the <i>act</i>, of
judging. And in like manner I distinguish <i>Objekt</i>
from <i>Gegenstand</i>, by printing the word “Object,”
when it represents the former, with a large initial.</p>
<p>The text I have followed is, in the main, that
printed by Hartenstein; but occasionally Rosenkranz
preserves the better reading. All important variants
between the First and Second Editions have been
indicated at the foot of the page. A few notes have
been added, which are enclosed in square brackets,
to distinguish them from those which formed part of
the original work. I have in general quoted Kant’s
<i>Introduction to Logic</i> and <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>
in Dr. Abbott’s translations.</p>
<p>My best thanks are due to Rev. J. H. Kennedy
and Mr. F. Purser for much valuable aid during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv">xlv</a></span>
the passage of this translation through the press.
And I am under even greater obligations to Mr.
Mahaffy, who was good enough to read through
the whole of the proof; by his acute and learned
criticisms many errors have been avoided. Others
I have no doubt still remain, but for these I must
be accounted alone responsible.</p>

<p class="p1">More than twenty-one years have passed since
the first edition of this Translation was published,
and during that time much has been written, both
in Germany and in England, on the subject of
Kant’s <i>Critique of Judgement</i>. In particular, the
German text has been critically determined by the
labours of Professor Windelband, whose fine edition
forms the fifth volume of Kant’s Collected Works as
issued by the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences
(Berlin, 1908). It will be indispensable to future
students. An excellent account of the significance,
in the Kantian system, of the <i>Urtheilskraft</i>, by Mr.
R. A. C. Macmillan, appeared in 1912; and Mr.
J. C. Meredith has published recently an English
edition of the <i>Critique of Aesthetical Judgement</i>, with
notes and essays, dealing with the philosophy of art,
which goes over the ground very fully.</p>
<p>Some critics of my first edition took exception to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</a></span>
the clumsiness of the word “representation” as the
equivalent of <i>Vorstellung</i>, but I have made no
change in this respect, as it seems to me (and so far
as I have observed to others who have worked on
the <i>Critique of Judgement</i>), that it is necessary to
preserve in English the relation between the noun
<i>Vorstellung</i> and the verb <i>vorstellen</i>, if Kant’s reasoning
is to be exhibited clearly. I have, however,
abandoned the attempt to preserve the word <i>Kritik</i>
in English, and have replaced it by <i>Critique</i> or
<i>criticism</i>, throughout. The other changes that have
been made are mere corrections or emendations of
faulty or obscure renderings, with a few additional
notes. I have left my original Introduction as it
was written in 1892, without attempting any fresh
examination of the problems that Kant set himself.</p>

<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>
<p>We may call the faculty of cognition from principles
<i>a priori</i>, <i>pure Reason</i>, and the inquiry into its
possibility and bounds generally the Critique of pure
Reason, although by this faculty we only understand
Reason in its theoretical employment, as it appears
under that name in the former work; without wishing
to inquire into its faculty, as practical Reason,
according to its special principles. That [Critique]
goes merely into our faculty of knowing things <i>a
priori</i>, and busies itself therefore only with the
<i>cognitive faculty</i> to the exclusion of the feeling of
pleasure and pain and the faculty of desire; and of
the cognitive faculties it only concerns itself with
<i>Understanding</i>, according to its principles <i>a priori</i>,
to the exclusion of <i>Judgement</i> and <i>Reason</i> (as faculties
alike belonging to theoretical cognition), because it
is found in the sequel that no other cognitive faculty
but the Understanding can furnish constitutive principles
of cognition <i>a priori</i>. The Critique, then,
which sifts them all, as regards the share which
each of the other faculties might pretend to have
in the clear possession of knowledge from its own
peculiar root, leaves nothing but what the <i>Understanding</i>
prescribes <i>a priori</i> as law for nature as
the complex of phenomena (whose form also is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
given <i>a priori</i>). It relegates all other pure concepts
under Ideas, which are transcendent for our
theoretical faculty of cognition, but are not therefore
useless or to be dispensed with. For they
serve as regulative principles; partly to check the
dangerous pretensions of Understanding, as if
(because it can furnish <i>a priori</i> the conditions of
the possibility of all things which it can know) it
had thereby confined within these bounds the possibility
of all things in general; and partly to lead it to
the consideration of nature according to a principle
of completeness, although it can never attain to
this, and thus to further the final design of all
knowledge.</p>
<p>It was then properly the <i>Understanding</i> which
has its special realm in the <i>cognitive faculty</i>, so
far as it contains constitutive principles of cognition
<i>a priori</i>, which by the Critique, comprehensively
called the Critique of pure Reason, was to be placed
in certain and sole possession<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8" id="FNanchor_8">8</a> against all other competitors.
And so also to <i>Reason</i>, which contains
constitutive principles <i>a priori</i> nowhere except
simply in respect of the <i>faculty of desire</i>, should
be assigned its place in the Critique of practical
Reason.</p>
<p>Whether now the <i>Judgement</i>, which in the order
of our cognitive faculties forms a mediating link
between Understanding and Reason, has also
principles <i>a priori</i> for itself; whether these are
constitutive or merely regulative (thus indicating
no special realm); and whether they give a rule <i>a
priori</i> to the feeling of pleasure and pain, as the
mediating link between the cognitive faculty and
the faculty of desire (just as the Understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
prescribes laws <i>a priori</i> to the first, Reason to the
second); these are the questions with which the
present Critique of Judgement is concerned.</p>
<p>A Critique of pure Reason, <i>i.e.</i> of our faculty of
judging <i>a priori</i> according to principles, would be
incomplete, if the Judgement, which as a cognitive
faculty also makes claim to such principles, were
not treated as a particular part of it; although its
principles in a system of pure Philosophy need
form no particular part between the theoretical
and the practical, but can be annexed when needful
to one or both as occasion requires. For if such
a system is one day to be completed under the
general name of Metaphysic (which it is possible
to achieve quite completely, and which is supremely
important for the use of Reason in every reference),
the soil for the edifice must be explored
by Criticism as deep down as the foundation of
the faculty of principles independent of experience,
in order that it may sink in no part, for this
would inevitably bring about the downfall of the
whole.</p>
<p>We can easily infer from the nature of the
Judgement (whose right use is so necessarily and
so universally requisite, that by the name of sound
Understanding nothing else but this faculty is
meant), that it must be attended with great difficulties
to find a principle peculiar to it; (some such
it must contain <i>a priori</i> in itself, for otherwise it
would not be set apart by the commonest Criticism
as a special cognitive faculty). This principle must
not be derived <i>a priori</i> from concepts, for these
belong to the Understanding, and Judgement is only
concerned with their application. It must, therefore,
furnish of itself a concept, through which, properly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
speaking, no thing is cognised, but which only serves
as a rule, though not an objective one to which it
can adapt its judgement; because for this latter
another faculty of Judgement would be requisite,
in order to be able to distinguish whether [any
given case] is or is not the case for the rule.</p>
<p>This perplexity about a principle (whether it is
subjective or objective) presents itself mainly in
those judgements that we call aesthetical, which
concern the Beautiful and the Sublime of Nature or
of Art. And, nevertheless, the critical investigation
of a principle of Judgement in these is the most
important part in a Critique of this faculty. For
although they do not by themselves contribute to
the knowledge of things, yet they belong to the
cognitive faculty alone, and point to an immediate
reference of this faculty to the feeling of pleasure or
pain according to some principle <i>a priori</i>; without
confusing this with what may be the determining
ground of the faculty of desire, which has its principles
<i>a priori</i> in concepts of Reason.—In the
logical judging of nature, experience exhibits a
conformity to law in things, to the understanding
or to the explanation of which the general concept
of the sensible does not attain; here the Judgement
can only derive from itself a principle of the
reference of the natural thing to the unknowable
supersensible (a principle which it must only use
from its own point of view for the cognition of
nature). And so, though in this case such a
principle <i>a priori</i> can and must be applied to the
<i>cognition</i> of the beings of the world, and opens out
at the same time prospects which are advantageous
for the practical Reason, yet it has no immediate
reference to the feeling of pleasure and pain. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
this reference is precisely the puzzle in the principle
of Judgement, which renders a special section for
this faculty necessary in the Critique; since the
logical judging according to concepts (from which
an immediate inference can never be drawn to
the feeling of pleasure and pain) along with their
critical limitation, has at all events been capable
of being appended to the theoretical part of
Philosophy.</p>
<p>The examination of the faculty of taste, as the
aesthetical Judgement, is not here planned in reference
to the formation or the culture of taste (for this will
take its course in the future as in the past without
any such investigations), but merely in a transcendental
point of view. Hence, I trust that as
regards the deficiency of the former purpose it will
be judged with indulgence, though in the latter
point of view it must be prepared for the severest
scrutiny. But I hope that the great difficulty of
solving a problem so involved by nature may serve
as excuse for some hardly avoidable obscurity in
its solution, if only it be clearly established that
the principle is correctly stated. I grant that the
mode of deriving the phenomena of the Judgement
from it has not all the clearness which might
be rightly demanded elsewhere, viz. in the case
of cognition according to concepts; but I believe
that I have attained to it in the second part of
this work.</p>
<p>Here then I end my whole critical undertaking.
I shall proceed without delay to the doctrinal [part]
in order to profit, as far as is possible, by the more
favourable moments of my increasing years. It is
obvious that in this [part] there will be no special
section for the Judgement, because in respect of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
faculty Criticism serves instead of Theory; but,
according to the division of Philosophy (and also of
pure Philosophy) into theoretical and practical, the
Metaphysic of Nature and of Morals will complete
the undertaking.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3 id="I">I. OF THE DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY</h3>
<p>We proceed quite correctly if, as usual, we divide
Philosophy, as containing the principles of the
rational cognition of things by means of concepts
(not merely, as logic does, principles of the form of
thought in general without distinction of Objects),
into <i>theoretical</i> and <i>practical</i>. But then the concepts,
which furnish their Object to the principles of this
rational cognition, must be specifically distinct;
otherwise they would not justify a division, which
always presupposes a contrast between the principles
of the rational cognition belonging to the different
parts of a science.</p>
<p>Now there are only two kinds of concepts, and
these admit as many distinct principles of the
possibility of their objects, viz. <i>natural concepts</i>
and the <i>concept of freedom</i>. The former render
possible <i>theoretical</i> cognition according to principles
<i>a priori</i>; the latter in respect of this theoretical
cognition only supplies in itself a negative principle
(that of mere contrast), but on the other hand it
furnishes fundamental propositions which extend
the sphere of the determination of the will and
are therefore called practical. Thus Philosophy is
correctly divided into two parts, quite distinct in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
their principles; the theoretical part or <i>Natural
Philosophy</i>, and the practical part or <i>Moral Philosophy</i>
(for that is the name given to the practical
legislation of Reason in accordance with the concept
of freedom). But up to the present a gross misuse
of these expressions has prevailed, both in the
division of the different principles and consequently
also of Philosophy itself. For what is practical
according to natural concepts has been identified
with the practical according to the concept of freedom;
and so with the like titles, ‘theoretical’ and
‘practical’ Philosophy, a division has been made,
by which in fact nothing has been divided (for both
parts might in such case have principles of the same
kind).</p>
<p>The will, regarded as the faculty of desire, is (in
this view) one of the many natural causes in the
world, viz. that cause which acts in accordance with
concepts. All that is represented as possible (or
necessary) by means of a will is called practically
possible (or necessary); as distinguished from the
physical possibility or necessity of an effect, whose
cause is not determined to causality by concepts
(but in lifeless matter by mechanism and in animals
by instinct). Here, in respect of the practical, it is
left undetermined whether the concept which gives
the rule to the causality of the will, is a natural concept
or a concept of freedom.</p>
<p>But the last distinction is essential. For if the
concept which determines the causality is a natural
concept, then the principles are <i>technically practical</i>;
whereas, if it is a concept of freedom they are <i>morally
practical</i>. And as the division of a rational science
depends on the distinction between objects whose
cognition needs distinct principles, the former will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
belong to theoretical Philosophy (doctrine of Nature),
but the latter alone will constitute the second part,
viz. practical Philosophy (doctrine of Morals).</p>
<p>All technically practical rules (<i>i.e.</i> the rules of art
and skill generally, or of prudence regarded as skill
in exercising an influence over men and their wills),
so far as their principles rest on concepts, must be
reckoned only as corollaries to theoretical Philosophy.
For they concern only the possibility of things according
to natural concepts, to which belong not
only the means which are to be met with in nature,
but also the will itself (as a faculty of desire and
consequently a natural faculty), so far as it can be
determined conformably to these rules by natural
motives. However, practical rules of this kind are
not called laws (like physical laws), but only precepts;
because the will does not stand merely under
the natural concept, but also under the concept of
freedom, in relation to which its principles are called
laws. These with their consequences alone constitute
the second or practical part of Philosophy.</p>
<p>The solution of the problems of pure geometry
does not belong to a particular part of the science;
mensuration does not deserve the name of practical,
in contrast to pure, geometry, as a second part of
geometry in general; and just as little ought the
mechanical or chemical art of experiment or observation
to be reckoned as a practical part of the
doctrine of Nature. Just as little, in fine, ought
housekeeping, farming, statesmanship, the art of
conversation, the prescribing of diet, the universal
doctrine of happiness itself, or the curbing of the
inclinations and checking of the affections for the
sake of happiness, to be reckoned as practical Philosophy,
or taken to constitute the second part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Philosophy in general. For all these contain only
rules of skill (and are consequently only technically
practical) for bringing about an effect that is possible
according to the natural concepts of causes and
effects, which, since they belong to theoretical Philosophy,
are subject to those precepts as mere corollaries
from it (viz. natural science), and can therefore
claim no place in a special Philosophy called practical.
On the other hand, the morally practical precepts,
which are altogether based on the concept of freedom
to the complete exclusion of the natural determining
grounds of the will, constitute a quite special class.
These, like the rules which nature obeys, are called
simply laws, but they do not, like them, rest on
sensuous conditions but on a supersensible principle;
and accordingly they require for themselves
a quite different part of Philosophy, called practical,
corresponding to its theoretical part.</p>
<p>We hence see that a complex of practical precepts
given by Philosophy does not constitute a
distinct part of Philosophy, as opposed to the theoretical
part, because these precepts are practical; for
they might be that, even if their principles were
derived altogether from the theoretical cognition of
nature (as technically practical rules). [A distinct
branch of Philosophy is constituted only] if their
principle, as it is not borrowed from the natural
concept, which is always sensuously conditioned,
rests on the supersensible, which alone makes the
concept of freedom cognisable by formal laws.
These precepts are then morally practical, <i>i.e.</i> not
merely precepts or rules in this or that aspect, but,
without any preceding reference to purposes and
designs, are laws.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>
<h3 id="II">II. OF THE REALM OF PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL</h3>
<p>So far as our concepts have <i>a priori</i> application,
so far extends the use of our cognitive faculty according
to principles, and with it Philosophy.</p>
<p>But the complex of all objects, to which those
concepts are referred, in order to bring about a
knowledge of them where it is possible, may be subdivided
according to the adequacy or inadequacy of
our [cognitive] faculty to this design.</p>
<p>Concepts, so far as they are referred to objects,
independently of the possibility or impossibility of
the cognition of these objects, have their field which
is determined merely according to the relation that
their Object has to our cognitive faculty in general.
The part of this field in which knowledge is possible
for us is a ground or territory (<i>territorium</i>) for these
concepts and the requisite cognitive faculty. The
part of this territory, where they are legislative, is
the realm (<i>ditio</i>) of these concepts and of the corresponding
cognitive faculties. Empirical concepts
have, therefore, their territory in nature, as the complex
of all objects of sense, but no realm, only a
dwelling-place (<i>domicilium</i>); for though they are
produced in conformity to law they are not legislative,
but the rules based on them are empirical and
consequently contingent.</p>
<p>Our whole cognitive faculty has two realms, that
of natural concepts and that of the concept of freedom;
for through both it is legislative <i>a priori</i>. In
accordance with this, Philosophy is divided into
theoretical and practical. But the territory to which
its realm extends and in which its legislation is
<i>exercised</i>, is always only the complex of objects of
all possible experience, so long as they are taken for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
nothing more than mere phenomena; for otherwise
no legislation of the Understanding in respect of
them is conceivable.</p>
<p>Legislation through natural concepts is carried
on by means of the Understanding and is theoretical.
Legislation through the concept of freedom is carried
on by the Reason and is merely practical. It is only
in the practical [sphere] that the Reason can be
legislative; in respect of theoretical cognition (of
nature) it can merely (as acquainted with law by
the Understanding) deduce from given laws consequences
which always remain within [the limits of]
nature. But on the other hand, Reason is not
always therefore <i>legislative</i>, where there are practical
rules, for they may be only technically practical.</p>
<p>Understanding and Reason exercise, therefore,
two distinct legislations in regard to one and the same
territory of experience, without prejudice to each
other. The concept of freedom as little disturbs
the legislation of nature, as the natural concept influences
the legislation through the former.—The
possibility of at least thinking without contradiction
the co-existence of both legislations, and of the corresponding
faculties in the same subject, has been
shown in the Critique of pure Reason; for it annulled
the objections on the other side by exposing the
dialectical illusion which they contain.</p>
<p>These two different realms then do not limit
each other in their legislation, though they perpetually
do so in the world of sense. That they
do not constitute <i>one</i> realm, arises from this, that
the natural concept represents its objects in intuition,
not as things in themselves, but as mere phenomena;
the concept of freedom, on the other hand, represents
in its Object a thing in itself, but not in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
intuition. Hence, neither of them can furnish a
theoretical knowledge of its Object (or even of
the thinking subject) as a thing in itself; this would
be the supersensible, the Idea of which we must
indeed make the basis of the possibility of all these
objects of experience, but which we can never extend
or elevate into a cognition.</p>
<p>There is, then, an unbounded but also inaccessible
field for our whole cognitive faculty—the field
of the supersensible—wherein we find no territory,
and, therefore, can have in it, for theoretical cognition,
no realm either for concepts of Understanding
or Reason. This field we must indeed occupy with
Ideas on behalf of the theoretical as well as the
practical use of Reason, but we can supply to them
in reference to the laws [arising] from the concept
of freedom no other than practical reality, by which
our theoretical cognition is not extended in the
slightest degree towards the supersensible.</p>
<p>Now even if an immeasurable gulf is fixed
between the sensible realm of the concept of nature
and the supersensible realm of the concept of freedom,
so that no transition is possible from the first to
the second (by means of the theoretical use of
Reason), just as if they were two different worlds
of which the first could have no influence upon
the second, yet the second is <i>meant</i> to have an influence
upon the first. The concept of freedom is
meant to actualise in the world of sense the purpose
proposed by its laws, and consequently nature must
be so thought that the conformity to law of its form,
at least harmonises with the possibility of the
purposes to be effected in it according to laws of
freedom.—There must, therefore, be a ground of
the <i>unity</i> of the supersensible, which lies at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
basis of nature, with that which the concept of
freedom practically contains; and the concept of
this ground, although it does not attain either
theoretically or practically to a knowledge of the
same, and hence has no peculiar realm, nevertheless
makes possible the transition from the mode of
thought according to the principles of the one to
that according to the principles of the other.</p>
<h3 id="III">III. OF THE CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT AS A MEANS OF
COMBINING THE TWO PARTS OF PHILOSOPHY INTO
A WHOLE.</h3>
<p>The Critique of the cognitive faculties, as regards
what they can furnish <i>a priori</i>, has properly speaking
no realm in respect of Objects, because it is not a
doctrine, but only has to investigate whether and
how, in accordance with the state of these faculties, a
doctrine is possible by their means. Its field extends
to all their pretensions, in order to confine them
within their legitimate bounds. But what cannot
enter into the division of Philosophy may yet enter,
as a chief part, into the Critique of the pure faculty
of cognition in general, viz. if it contains principles
which are available neither for theoretical nor for
practical use.</p>
<p>The natural concepts, which contain the ground
of all theoretical knowledge <i>a priori</i>, rest on the
legislation of the Understanding.—The concept of
freedom, which contains the ground of all sensuously-unconditioned
practical precepts <i>a priori</i>, rests on
the legislation of the Reason. Both faculties, therefore,
besides being capable of application as regards
their logical form to principles of whatever origin,
have also as regards their content, their special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
legislations above which there is no other (<i>a priori</i>);
and hence the division of Philosophy into theoretical
and practical is justified.</p>
<p>But in the family of the higher cognitive
faculties there is a middle term between the Understanding
and the Reason. This is the <i>Judgement</i>, of
which we have cause for supposing according to
analogy that it may contain in itself, if not a special
legislation, yet a special principle of its own to be
sought according to laws, though merely subjective
<i>a priori</i>. This principle, even if it have no field
of objects as its realm, yet may have somewhere a
territory with a certain character, for which no other
principle can be valid.</p>
<p>But besides (to judge by analogy) there is a
new ground for bringing the Judgement into connexion
with another arrangement of our representative
faculties, which seems to be of even
greater importance than that of its relationship
with the family of the cognitive faculties. For all
faculties or capacities of the soul can be reduced to
three, which cannot be any further derived from one
common ground: the <i>faculty of knowledge</i>, the <i>feeling
of pleasure and pain</i>, and the <i>faculty of desire</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9" id="FNanchor_9">9</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
For the faculty of knowledge the Understanding is
alone legislative, if (as must happen when it is considered
by itself without confusion with the faculty
of desire) this faculty is referred to nature as the
faculty of <i>theoretical knowledge</i>; for in respect of
nature (as phenomenon) it is alone possible for us
to give laws by means of natural concepts <i>a priori</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> by pure concepts of Understanding.—For the
faculty of desire, as a higher faculty according to the
concept of freedom, the Reason (in which alone this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
concept has a place) is alone <i>a priori</i> legislative.—Now
between the faculties of knowledge and desire
there is the feeling of pleasure, just as the Judgement
is intermediate between the Understanding
and the Reason. We may therefore suppose provisionally
that the Judgement likewise contains in
itself an <i>a priori</i> principle. And as pleasure or
pain is necessarily combined with the faculty of
desire (either preceding this principle as in the
lower desires, or following it as in the higher, when
the desire is determined by the moral law), we may
also suppose that the Judgement will bring about a
transition from the pure faculty of knowledge, the
realm of natural concepts, to the realm of the concept
of freedom, just as in its logical use it makes
possible the transition from Understanding to
Reason.</p>
<p>Although, then, Philosophy can be divided only
into two main parts, the theoretical and the practical,
and although all that we may be able to say of the
special principles of Judgement must be counted as
belonging in it to the theoretical part, <i>i.e.</i> to rational
cognition in accordance with natural concepts; yet
the Critique of pure Reason, which must decide all
this, as regards the possibility of the system before
undertaking it, consists of three parts; the Critique
of pure Understanding, of pure Judgement, and of
pure Reason, which faculties are called pure because
they are legislative <i>a priori</i>.</p>
<h3 id="IV">IV. OF JUDGEMENT AS A FACULTY LEGISLATING <i>A PRIORI</i></h3>
<p>Judgement in general is the faculty of thinking
the particular as contained under the Universal. If
the universal (the rule, the principle, the law) be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
given, the Judgement which subsumes the particular
under it (even if, as transcendental Judgement, it
furnishes <i>a priori</i>, the conditions in conformity with
which subsumption under that universal is alone
possible) is <i>determinant</i>. But if only the particular
be given for which the universal has to be found,
the Judgement is merely <i>reflective</i>.</p>
<p>The determinant Judgement only subsumes under
universal transcendental laws given by the Understanding;
the law is marked out for it, <i>a priori</i>, and
it has therefore no need to seek a law for itself
in order to be able to subordinate the particular in
nature to the universal.—But the forms of nature
are so manifold, and there are so many modifications
of the universal transcendental natural concepts
left undetermined by the laws given, <i>a priori</i>,
by the pure Understanding,—because these only
concern the possibility of a nature in general (as an
object of sense),—that there must be laws for these
[forms] also. These, as empirical, may be contingent
from the point of view of <i>our</i> Understanding, and yet,
if they are to be called laws (as the concept of a
nature requires), they must be regarded as necessary
in virtue of a principle of the unity of the manifold,
though it be unknown to us.—The reflective Judgement,
which is obliged to ascend from the particular
in nature to the universal, requires on that account
a principle that it cannot borrow from experience,
because its function is to establish the unity of all
empirical principles under higher ones, and hence
to establish the possibility of their systematic subordination.
Such a transcendental principle, then,
the reflective Judgement can only give as a law from
and to itself. It cannot derive it from outside
(because then it would be the determinant Judgement);<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
nor can it prescribe it to nature, because
reflection upon the laws of nature adjusts itself by
nature, and not nature by the conditions according
to which we attempt to arrive at a concept of it
which is quite contingent in respect of these.</p>
<p>This principle can be no other than the following:
As universal laws of nature have their ground
in our Understanding, which prescribes them to
nature (although only according to the universal
concept of it as nature); so particular empirical laws,
in respect of what is in them left undetermined by
these universal laws, must be considered in accordance
with such a unity as they would have if an
Understanding (although not our Understanding)
had furnished them to our cognitive faculties, so as
to make possible a system of experience according
to particular laws of nature. Not as if, in this
way, such an Understanding must be assumed as
actual (for it is only our reflective Judgement to
which this Idea serves as a principle—for reflecting,
not for determining); but this faculty thus gives a
law only to itself and not to nature.</p>
<p>Now the concept of an Object, so far as it contains
the ground of the actuality of this Object, is the
<i>purpose</i>; and the agreement of a thing with that
constitution of things, which is only possible according
to purposes, is called the <i>purposiveness</i> of its
form. Thus the principle of Judgement, in respect
of the form of things of nature under empirical laws
generally, is the <i>purposiveness of nature</i> in its manifoldness.
That is, nature is represented by means of this
concept, as if an Understanding contained the ground
of the unity of the manifold of its empirical laws.</p>
<p>The purposiveness of nature is therefore a particular
concept, <i>a priori</i>, which has its origin solely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
in the reflective Judgement. For we cannot ascribe
to natural products anything like a reference of
nature in them to purposes; we can only use this
concept to reflect upon such products in respect of
the connexion of phenomena which is given in nature
according to empirical laws. This concept is also
quite different from practical purposiveness (in
human art or in morals), though it is certainly
thought according to the analogy of these last.</p>
<h3 id="V">V. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FORMAL PURPOSIVENESS
OF NATURE IS A TRANSCENDENTAL PRINCIPLE OF JUDGEMENT.</h3>
<p>A transcendental principle is one by means of
which is represented, <i>a priori</i>, the universal condition
under which alone things can be in general
Objects of our cognition. On the other hand, a
principle is called metaphysical if it represents the
<i>a priori</i> condition under which alone Objects, whose
concept must be empirically given, can be further
determined <i>a priori</i>. Thus the principle of the
cognition of bodies as substances, and as changeable
substances, is transcendental, if thereby it is asserted
that their changes must have a cause; it is metaphysical
if it asserts that their changes must have an
<i>external</i> cause. For in the former case bodies need
only be thought by means of ontological predicates
(pure concepts of Understanding), <i>e.g.</i> substance,
in order to cognise the proposition <i>a priori</i>; but in
the latter case the empirical concept of a body (as a
movable thing in space) must lie at the basis of the
proposition, although once this basis has been laid
down, it may be seen completely <i>a priori</i> that this
latter predicate (motion only by external causes)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
belongs to body.—Thus, as I shall presently show,
the principle of the purposiveness of nature (in the
manifoldness of its empirical laws) is a transcendental
principle. For the concept of Objects, so far as
they are thought as standing under this principle, is
only the pure concept of objects of possible empirical
cognition in general and contains nothing empirical.
On the other hand, the principle of practical purposiveness,
which must be thought in the Idea of the
<i>determination</i> of a free <i>will</i>, is a metaphysical principle;
because the concept of a faculty of desire as
a will must be given empirically (<i>i.e.</i> does not belong
to transcendental predicates). Both principles are,
however, not empirical, but <i>a priori</i>; because for
the combination of the predicate with the empirical
concept of the subject of their judgements no further
experience is needed, but it can be apprehended
completely <i>a priori</i>.</p>
<p>That the concept of a purposiveness of nature
belongs to transcendental principles can be sufficiently
seen from the maxims of the Judgement, which lie
at the basis of the investigation of nature <i>a priori</i>,
and yet do not go further than the possibility of
experience, and consequently of the cognition of
nature—not indeed nature in general, but nature
as determined through a variety of particular laws.
These maxims present themselves in the course
of this science often enough, though in a scattered
way, as sentences of metaphysical wisdom, whose
necessity we cannot demonstrate from concepts.
“Nature takes the shortest way (<i>lex parsimoniae</i>);
at the same time it makes no leaps, either in the
course of its changes or in the juxtaposition of
specifically different forms (<i>lex continui in natura</i>);
its great variety in empirical laws is yet unity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
under a few principles (<i>principia praeter necessitatem
non sunt multiplicanda</i>),” etc.</p>
<p>If we propose to set forth the origin of these
fundamental propositions and try to do so by the
psychological method, we violate their sense. For
they do not tell us what happens, <i>i.e.</i> by what rule
our cognitive powers actually operate, and how we
judge, but how we ought to judge; and this logical
objective necessity does not emerge if the principles
are merely empirical. Hence that purposiveness of
nature for our cognitive faculties and their use, which
is plainly apparent from them, is a transcendental
principle of judgements, and needs therefore also a
Transcendental Deduction, by means of which the
ground for so judging must be sought in the
sources of cognition <i>a priori</i>.</p>
<p>We find in the grounds of the possibility of an
experience in the very first place something necessary,
viz. the universal laws without which nature
in general (as an object of sense) cannot be thought;
and these rest upon the Categories, applied to the
formal conditions of all intuition possible for us, so
far as it is also given <i>a priori</i>. Now under these
laws the Judgement is determinant, for it has nothing
to do but to subsume under given laws. For
example, the Understanding says that every change
has its cause (universal law of nature); the transcendental
Judgement has nothing further to do than
to supply <i>a priori</i> the condition of subsumption
under the concept of the Understanding placed
before it, <i>i.e.</i> the succession [in time] of the determinations
of one and the same thing. For nature
in general (as an object of possible experience) that
law is cognised as absolutely necessary.—But
now the objects of empirical cognition are determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
in many other ways than by that formal time-condition,
or, at least as far as we can judge <i>a priori</i>,
are determinable. Hence specifically different
natures can be causes in an infinite variety of ways,
as well as in virtue of what they have in common
as belonging to nature in general; and each of these
modes must (in accordance with the concept of a
cause in general) have its rule, which is a law and
therefore brings necessity with it, although we do
not at all comprehend this necessity, in virtue of the
constitution and the limitations of our cognitive
faculties. We must therefore think in nature, in
respect of its merely empirical laws, a possibility of
infinitely various empirical laws, which are, as far as
our insight goes, contingent (cannot be cognised <i>a
priori</i>), and in respect of which we judge nature,
according to empirical laws and the possibility of the
unity of experience (as a system according to empirical
laws), to be contingent. But such a unity
must be necessarily presupposed and assumed, for
otherwise there would be no thoroughgoing connexion
of empirical cognitions in a whole of experience.
The universal laws of nature no doubt
furnish such a connexion of things according to
their kind as things of nature in general, but not
specifically, as such particular beings of nature.
Hence the Judgement must assume for its special
use this principle <i>a priori</i>, that what in the particular
(empirical) laws of nature is from the human point
of view contingent, yet contains a unity of law in
the combination of its manifold into an experience
possible in itself—a unity not indeed to be fathomed
by us, but yet thinkable. Consequently as the unity
of law in a combination, which we cognise as contingent
in itself, although in conformity with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
necessary design (a need) of Understanding, is represented
as the purposiveness of Objects (here of
nature); so must the Judgement, which in respect
of things under possible (not yet discovered) empirical
laws is merely reflection, think of nature in
respect of the latter according to <i>a principle of
purposiveness</i> for our cognitive faculty, which then is
expressed in the above maxims of the Judgement.
This transcendental concept of a purposiveness of
nature is neither a natural concept nor a concept of
freedom, because it ascribes nothing to the Object
(of nature), but only represents the peculiar way in
which we must proceed in reflection upon the
objects of nature in reference to a thoroughly connected
experience, and is consequently a subjective
principle (maxim) of the Judgement. Hence, as if
it were a lucky chance favouring our design, we are
rejoiced (properly speaking, relieved of a want), if
we meet with such systematic unity under merely
empirical laws; although we must necessarily assume
that there is such a unity without our comprehending
it or being able to prove it.</p>
<p>In order to convince ourselves of the correctness
of this Deduction of the concept before us, and the
necessity of assuming it as a transcendental principle
of cognition, just consider the magnitude of the
problem. The problem, which lies <i>a priori</i> in our
Understanding, is to make a connected experience
out of given perceptions of a nature containing at
all events an infinite variety of empirical laws. The
Understanding is, no doubt, in possession <i>a priori</i>
of universal laws of nature, without which nature
could not be an object of experience; but it needs
in addition a certain order of nature in its particular
rules, which can only be empirically known and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
which are, as regards the Understanding, contingent.
These rules, without which we could not proceed
from the universal analogy of a possible experience
in general to the particular, must be thought by it as
laws (<i>i.e.</i> as necessary), for otherwise they would
not constitute an order of nature; although their
necessity can never be cognised or comprehended
by it. Although, therefore, the Understanding can
determine nothing <i>a priori</i> in respect of Objects, it
must, in order to trace out these empirical so-called
laws, place at the basis of all reflection upon Objects
an <i>a priori</i> principle, viz. that a cognisable order
of nature is possible in accordance with these laws.
The following propositions express some such principle.
There is in nature a subordination of genera
and species comprehensible by us. Each one
approximates to some other according to a common
principle, so that a transition from one to another
and so on to a higher genus may be possible.
Though it seems at the outset unavoidable for our
Understanding to assume different kinds of causality
for the specific differences of natural operations, yet
these different kinds may stand under a small
number of principles, with the investigation of which
we have to busy ourselves. This harmony of nature
with our cognitive faculty is presupposed <i>a priori</i>
by the Judgement, on behalf of its reflection upon
nature in accordance with its empirical laws; whilst
the Understanding at the same time cognises it
objectively as contingent, and it is only the Judgement
that ascribes it to nature as a trancendental
purposiveness (in relation to the cognitive faculty of
the subject). For without this presupposition we
should have no order of nature in accordance with
empirical laws, and consequently no guiding thread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
for an experience ordered by these in all their variety,
or for an investigation of them.</p>
<p>For it might easily be thought that, in spite of
all the uniformity of natural things according to the
universal laws, without which we should not have
the form of an empirical cognition in general, the
specific variety of the empirical laws of nature
including their effects might yet be so great, that
it would be impossible for our Understanding, to
detect in nature a comprehensible order; to divide
its products into genera and species, so as to use
the principles which explain and make intelligible
one for the explanation and comprehension of
another; or out of such confused material (strictly
we should say, so infinitely various and not to be
measured by our faculty of comprehension) to make
a connected experience.</p>
<p>The Judgement has therefore also in itself a
principle <i>a priori</i> of the possibility of nature, but
only in a subjective aspect; by which it prescribes,
not to nature (autonomy), but to itself (heautonomy)
a law for its reflection upon nature. This we might
call the <i>law of the specification of nature</i> in respect
of its empirical laws. The Judgement does not
cognise this <i>a priori</i> in nature, but assumes it on
behalf of a natural order cognisable by our Understanding
in the division which it makes of the
universal laws of nature when it wishes to subordinate
to these the variety of particular laws. If then we
say that nature specifies its universal laws according
to the principles of purposiveness for our cognitive
faculty, <i>i.e.</i> in accordance with the necessary business
of the human Understanding of finding the universal
for the particular which perception offers it, and again
of finding connexion for the diverse (which however<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
is a universal for each species) in the unity of
a principle,—we thus neither prescribe to nature a
law, nor do we learn one from it by observation
(although such a principle may be confirmed by this
means). For it is not a principle of the determinant
but merely of the reflective Judgement. We only
require that, be nature disposed as it may as regards
its universal laws, investigation into its empirical
laws may be carried on in accordance with that
principle and the maxims founded thereon, because
it is only so far as that holds that we can make
any progress with the use of our Understanding in
experience, or gain knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="VI">VI. OF THE COMBINATION OF THE FEELING OF
PLEASURE WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE.</h3>
<p>The thought harmony of nature in the variety
of its particular laws with our need of finding
universality of principles for it, must be judged as
contingent in respect of our insight, but yet at the
same time as indispensable for the needs of our
Understanding, and consequently as a purposiveness
by which nature is harmonised with our design,
which, however, has only knowledge for its aim.
The universal laws of the Understanding, which
are at the same time laws of nature, are just as
necessary (although arising from spontaneity) as the
material laws of motion. Their production presupposes
no design on the part of our cognitive
faculty, because it is only by means of them that
we, in the first place, attain a concept of what the
cognition of things (of nature) is, and attribute them
necessarily to nature as Object of our cognition in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
general. But, so far as we can see, it is contingent
that the order of nature according to its particular
laws, in all its variety and heterogeneity possibly at
least transcending our comprehension, should be
actually conformable to these [laws]. The discovery
of this [order] is the business of the Understanding
which is designedly borne towards a necessary
purpose, viz. the bringing of unity of principles into
nature, which purpose then the Judgement must
ascribe to nature, because the Understanding cannot
here prescribe any law to it.</p>
<p>The attainment of that design is bound up with
the feeling of pleasure, and since the condition of this
attainment is a representation <i>a priori</i>,—as here a
principle for the reflective Judgement in general,—therefore
the feeling of pleasure is determined by a
ground <i>a priori</i> and valid for every man, and that
merely by the reference of the Object to the cognitive
faculty, the concept of purposiveness here not having
the least reference to the faculty of desire. It is thus
quite distinguished from all practical purposiveness
of nature.</p>
<p>In fact, although from the agreement of perceptions
with laws in accordance with universal
natural concepts (the categories), we do not and
cannot find in ourselves the slightest effect upon the
feeling of pleasure, because the Understanding
necessarily proceeds according to its nature without
any design; yet, on the other hand, the discovery
that two or more empirical heterogeneous laws of
nature may be combined under one principle comprehending
them both, is the ground of a very
marked pleasure, often even of an admiration, which
does not cease, though we may be already quite
familiar with the objects of it. We no longer find, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
is true, any marked pleasure in the comprehensibility
of nature and in the unity of its divisions into genera
and species, whereby are possible all empirical concepts,
through which we cognise it according to
its particular laws. But this pleasure has certainly
been present at one time, and it is only because the
commonest experience would be impossible without
it that it is gradually confounded with mere cognition
and no longer arrests particular attention. There is
then something in our judgements upon nature which
makes us attentive to its purposiveness for our Understanding—an
endeavour to bring, where possible, its
dissimilar laws under higher ones, though still always
empirical—and thus, if successful, makes us feel pleasure
in that harmony of these with our cognitive
faculty, which harmony we regard as merely contingent.
On the other hand, a representation of nature
would altogether displease, by which it should be
foretold to us that in the smallest investigation
beyond the commonest experience we should meet
with a heterogeneity of its laws, which would make the
union of its particular laws under universal empirical
laws impossible for our Understanding. For this
would contradict the principle of the subjectively-purposive
specification of nature in its genera, and
also of our reflective Judgement in respect of such
principle.</p>
<p>This presupposition of the Judgement is, however,
at the same time so indeterminate as to how far that
ideal purposiveness of nature for our cognitive
faculty should be extended, that if we were told that
a deeper or wider knowledge of nature derived from
observation must lead at last to a variety of laws,
which no human Understanding could reduce to a
principle, we should at once acquiesce. But still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
we more gladly listen to one who offers hope that
the more we know nature internally, and can compare
it with external members now unknown to us, the
more simple shall we find it in its principles, and that
the further our experience reaches the more uniform
shall we find it amid the apparent heterogeneity of
its empirical laws. For it is a mandate of our
Judgement to proceed according to the principle of
the harmony of nature with our cognitive faculty so
far as that reaches, without deciding (because it is
not the determinant Judgement which gives us this
rule) whether or not it is bounded anywhere. For
although in respect of the rational use of our cognitive
faculty we can determine such bounds, this is not
possible in the empirical field.</p>
<h3 id="VII">VII. OF THE AESTHETICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE
PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE.</h3>
<p>That which in the representation of an Object
is merely subjective, <i>i.e.</i> which decides its reference
to the subject, not to the object, is its aesthetical
character; but that which serves or can be used for
the determination of the object (for cognition), is its
logical validity. In the cognition of an object of
sense both references present themselves. In the
sense-representation of external things the quality
of space wherein we intuite them is the merely
subjective [element] of my representation (by which
it remains undecided what they may be in themselves
as Objects), on account of which reference
the object is thought thereby merely as phenomenon.
But space, notwithstanding its merely subjective
quality, is at the same time an ingredient in the
cognition of things as phenomena. <i>Sensation</i>, again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
(<i>i.e.</i> external sensation), expresses the merely subjective
[element] of our representations of external
things, but it is also the proper material (reale) of
them (by which something existing is given), just
as space is the mere form <i>a priori</i> of the possibility
of their intuition. Nevertheless, however, sensation
is also employed in the cognition of external Objects.</p>
<p>But the subjective [element] in a representation
<i>which cannot be an ingredient of cognition</i>, is the
<i>pleasure</i> or <i>pain</i> which is bound up with it; for
through it I cognise nothing in the object of the
representation, although it may be the effect of some
cognition. Now the purposiveness of a thing, so
far as it is represented in perception, is no characteristic
of the Object itself (for such cannot be perceived),
although it may be inferred from a cognition of
things. The purposiveness, therefore, which precedes
the cognition of an Object, and which, even
without our wishing to use the representation of it
for cognition, is, at the same time, immediately
bound up with it, is that subjective [element] which
cannot be an ingredient in cognition. Hence the
object is only called purposive, when its representation
is immediately combined with the feeling of
pleasure; and this very representation is an aesthetical
representation of purposiveness.—The only
question is whether there is, in general, such a
representation of purposiveness.</p>
<p>If pleasure is bound up with the mere apprehension
(<i>apprehensio</i>) of the form of an object of intuition,
without reference to a concept for a definite
cognition, then the representation is thereby not
referred to the Object, but simply to the subject;
and the pleasure can express nothing else than its
harmony with the cognitive faculties which come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
into play in the reflective Judgement, and so far as
they are in play; and hence can only express a
subjective formal purposiveness of the Object. For
that apprehension of forms in the Imagination can
never take place without the reflective Judgement,
though undesignedly, at least comparing them with
its faculty of referring intuitions to concepts. If
now in this comparison the Imagination (as the
faculty of <i>a priori</i> intuitions) is placed by means
of a given representation undesignedly in agreement
with the Understanding, as the faculty of concepts,
and thus a feeling of pleasure is aroused, the object
must then be regarded as purposive for the reflective
Judgement. Such a judgement is an aesthetical
judgement upon the purposiveness of the Object,
which does not base itself upon any present concept
of the object, nor does it furnish any such. In the
case of an object whose form (not the matter of its
representation, as sensation), in the mere reflection
upon it (without reference to any concept to be
obtained of it), is judged as the ground of a pleasure
in the representation of such an Object, this pleasure
is judged as bound up with the representation
necessarily; and, consequently, not only for the
subject which apprehends this form, but for every
judging being in general. The object is then called
beautiful; and the faculty of judging by means of
such a pleasure (and, consequently, with universal
validity) is called Taste. For since the ground of
the pleasure is placed merely in the form of the
object for reflection in general—and, consequently,
in no sensation of the object, and also without
reference to any concept which anywhere involves
design—it is only the conformity to law in the
empirical use of the Judgement in general (unity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
the Imagination with the Understanding) in the
subject, with which the representation of the Object
in reflection, whose conditions are universally valid
<i>a priori</i>, harmonises. And since this harmony of
the object with the faculties of the subject is contingent,
it brings about the representation of its
purposiveness in respect of the cognitive faculties of
the subject.</p>
<p>Here now is a pleasure, which, like all pleasure
or pain that is not produced through the concept of
freedom (<i>i.e.</i> through the preceding determination
of the higher faculties of desire by pure Reason),
can never be comprehended from concepts, as
necessarily bound up with the representation of an
object. It must always be cognised as combined
with this only by means of reflective perception;
and, consequently, like all empirical judgements, it
can declare no objective necessity and lay claim to
no <i>a priori</i> validity. But the judgement of taste
also claims, as every other empirical judgement does,
to be valid for every one; and in spite of its inner
contingency this is always possible. The strange
and irregular thing is that it is not an empirical
concept, but a feeling of pleasure (consequently not
a concept at all), which by the judgement of taste is
attributed to every one,—just as if it were a predicate
bound up with the cognition of the Object—and
which is connected with the representation thereof.</p>
<p>A singular judgement of experience, <i>e.g.</i>, when we
perceive a moveable drop of water in an ice-crystal,
may justly claim that every one else should find it
the same; because we have formed this judgement,
according to the universal conditions of the determinant
faculty of Judgement, under the laws of a
possible experience in general. Just in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
way he who feels pleasure in the mere reflection
upon the form of an object without respect to any
concept, although this judgement be empirical and
singular, justly claims the agreement of every one;
because the ground of this pleasure is found in the
universal, although subjective, condition of reflective
judgements, viz., the purposive harmony of an object
(whether a product of nature or of art) with the
mutual relations of the cognitive faculties (the
Imagination and the Understanding), a harmony
which is requisite for every empirical cognition.
The pleasure, therefore, in the judgement of taste is
dependent on an empirical representation, and cannot
be bound up <i>a priori</i> with any concept (we cannot
determine <i>a priori</i> what object is or is not according
to taste; that we must find out by experiment).
But the pleasure is the determining ground of this
judgement only because we are conscious that it rests
merely on reflection and on the universal though
only subjective conditions of the harmony of that
reflection with the cognition of Objects in general,
for which the form of the Object is purposive.</p>
<p>Thus the reason why judgements of taste according
to their possibility are subjected to a Critique
is that they presuppose a principle <i>a priori</i>, although
this principle is neither one of cognition for the
Understanding nor of practice for the Will, and
therefore is not in any way determinant <i>a priori</i>.</p>
<p>Susceptibility to pleasure from reflection upon
the forms of things (of Nature as well as of Art),
indicates not only a purposiveness of the Objects
in relation to the reflective Judgement, conformably
to the concept of nature in the subject; but also
conversely a purposiveness of the subject in respect
of the objects according to their form or even their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
formlessness, in virtue of the concept of freedom.
Hence the aesthetical judgement is not only related
as a judgement of taste to the beautiful, but also
as springing from a spiritual feeling is related to
the <i>sublime</i>; and thus the Critique of the aesthetical
Judgement must be divided into two corresponding
sections.</p>
<h3 id="VIII">VIII. OF THE LOGICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE
PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE</h3>
<p>Purposiveness may be represented in an object
given in experience on a merely subjective ground,
as the harmony of its form,—in the <i>apprehension</i>
(<i>apprehensio</i>) of it prior to any concept,—with the
cognitive faculties, in order to unite the intuition
with concepts for a cognition generally. Or it
may be represented objectively as the harmony
of the form of the object with the possibility of the
thing itself, according to a concept of it which
precedes and contains the ground of this form.
We have seen that the representation of purposiveness
of the first kind rests on the immediate
pleasure in the form of the object in the mere
reflection upon it. But the representation of purposiveness
of the second kind, since it refers the
form of the Object, not to the cognitive faculties
of the subject in the apprehension of it, but to a
definite cognition of the object under a given concept,
has nothing to do with a feeling of pleasure in
things, but only with the Understanding in its judgement
upon them. If the concept of an object is
given, the business of the Judgement in the use of
the concept for cognition consists in <i>presentation</i>
(<i>exhibitio</i>), <i>i.e.</i> in setting a corresponding intuition
beside the concept. This may take place either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
through our own Imagination, as in Art when we
realise a preconceived concept of an object which
is a purpose of ours; or through Nature in its Technic
(as in organised bodies) when we supply to it our concept
of its purpose in order to judge of its products.
In the latter case it is not merely the <i>purposiveness</i>
of nature in the form of the thing that is represented,
but this its product is represented as a <i>natural
purpose</i>.—Although our concept of a subjective
purposiveness of nature in its forms according to
empirical laws is not a concept of the Object,
but only a principle of the Judgement for furnishing
itself with concepts amid the immense variety
of nature (and thus being able to ascertain its own
position), yet we thus ascribe to nature as it
were a regard to our cognitive faculty according
to the analogy of purpose. Thus we can regard
<i>natural beauty</i> as the <i>presentation</i> of the concept
of the formal (merely subjective) purposiveness,
and <i>natural purposes</i> as the presentation of the
concept of a real (objective) purposiveness. The
former of these we judge of by Taste (aesthetically,
by the medium of the feeling of pleasure), the latter
by Understanding and Reason (logically, according
to concepts).</p>
<p>On this is based the division of the Critique of
Judgement into the Critique of <i>aesthetical</i> and of
<i>teleological</i> Judgement. By the first we understand
the faculty of judging of the formal purposiveness
(otherwise called subjective) of Nature by means of
the feeling of pleasure or pain; by the second the
faculty of judging its real (objective) purposiveness
by means of Understanding and Reason.</p>
<p>In a Critique of Judgement the part containing the
aesthetical Judgement is essential, because this alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
contains a principle which the Judgement places
quite <i>a priori</i> at the basis of its reflection upon
nature; viz., the principle of a formal purposiveness
of nature, according to its particular (empirical) laws,
for our cognitive faculty, without which the Understanding
could not find itself in nature. On the
other hand no reason <i>a priori</i> could be specified,—and
even the possibility of a reason would not be
apparent from the concept of nature as an object
of experience whether general or particular,—why
there should be objective purposes of nature, <i>i.e.</i>
things which are only possible as natural purposes;
but the Judgement, without containing such a
principle <i>a priori</i> in itself, in given cases (of certain
products), in order to make use of the concept of
purposes on behalf of Reason, would only contain
the rule according to which that transcendental
principle has already prepared the Understanding
to apply to nature the concept of a purpose (at least
as regards its form).</p>
<p>But the transcendental principle which represents
a purposiveness of nature (in subjective reference to
our cognitive faculty) in the form of a thing as a
principle by which we judge of nature, leaves it
quite undetermined where and in what cases I have
to judge of a product according to a principle of
purposiveness, and not rather according to universal
natural laws. It leaves it to the <i>aesthetical</i> Judgement
to decide by taste the harmony of this product
(of its form) with our cognitive faculty (so far as this
decision rests not on any agreement with concepts
but on feeling). On the other hand, the Judgement
teleologically employed furnishes conditions determinately
under which something (<i>e.g.</i> an organised
body) is to be judged according to the Idea of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
purpose of nature; but it can adduce no fundamental
proposition from the concept of nature as an object
of experience authorising it to ascribe to nature <i>a
priori</i> a reference to purposes, or even indeterminately
to assume this of such products in actual experience.
The reason of this is that we must have many
particular experiences, and consider them under the
unity of their principle, in order to be able to cognise,
even empirically, objective purposiveness in a certain
object.—The aesthetical Judgement is therefore
a special faculty for judging of things according to
a rule, but not according to concepts. The teleological
Judgement is not a special faculty, but only
the reflective Judgement in general, so far as it
proceeds, as it always does in theoretical cognition,
according to concepts; but in respect of certain
objects of nature according to special principles, viz.,
of a merely reflective Judgement, and not of a Judgement
that determines Objects. Thus as regards its
application it belongs to the theoretical part of Philosophy;
and on account of its special principles which
are not determinant, as they must be in Doctrine,
it must constitute a special part of the Critique. On
the other hand, the aesthetical Judgement contributes
nothing towards the knowledge of its objects, and
thus must be reckoned as belonging to the criticism
of the judging subject and its cognitive faculties,
<i>only</i> so far as they are susceptible of <i>a priori</i>
principles, of whatever other use (theoretical or
practical) they may be. This is the propaedeutic
of all Philosophy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>
<h3 id="IX">IX. OF THE CONNEXION OF THE LEGISLATION OF UNDERSTANDING
WITH THAT OF REASON BY MEANS OF THE JUDGEMENT</h3>
<p>The Understanding legislates <i>a priori</i> for nature
as an Object of sense—for a theoretical knowledge
of it in a possible experience. Reason legislates <i>a
priori</i> for freedom and its peculiar casuality; as the
supersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned
practical knowledge. The realm of the natural
concept under the one legislation and that of the
concept of freedom under the other are entirely
removed from all mutual influence which they might
have on one another (each according to its fundamental
laws) by the great gulf that separates the
supersensible from phenomena. The concept of
freedom determines nothing in respect of the
theoretical cognition of nature; and the natural concept
determines nothing in respect of the practical
laws of freedom. So far then it is not possible to
throw a bridge from the one realm to the other.
But although the determining grounds of causality
according to the concept of freedom (and the
practical rules which it contains) are not resident
in nature, and the sensible cannot determine the
supersensible in the subject, yet this is possible
conversely (not, to be sure, in respect of the cognition
of nature, but as regards the effects of the supersensible
upon the sensible). This in fact is involved
in the concept of a causality through freedom, the
<i>effect</i> of which is to take place in the world according
to its formal laws. The word <i>cause</i>, of course,
when used of the supersensible only signifies the
<i>ground</i> which determines the causality of natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
things to an effect in accordance with their proper
natural laws, although harmoniously with the formal
principle of the laws of Reason. Although the
possibility of this cannot be comprehended, yet the
objection of a contradiction alleged to be found in
it can be sufficiently answered.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10" id="FNanchor_10">10</a>—The effect in
accordance with the concept of freedom is the final
purpose which (or its phenomenon in the world of
sense) ought to exist; and the condition of the
possibility of this is presupposed in nature (in the
nature of the subject as a sensible being, that is, as
man). The Judgement presupposes this <i>a priori</i>
and without reference to the practical; and thus
furnishes the mediating concept between the concepts
of nature and that of freedom. It makes
possible the transition from the conformity to law
in accordance with the former to the final purpose
in accordance with the latter, and this by the
concept of a <i>purposiveness</i> of nature. For thus is
cognised the possibility of the final purpose which
alone can be actualised in nature in harmony with
its laws.</p>
<p>The Understanding by the possibility of its <i>a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
priori</i> laws for nature, gives a proof that nature is
only cognised by us as phenomenon; and implies
at the same time that it has a supersensible substrate,
though it leaves this quite <i>undetermined</i>.
The Judgement by its <i>a priori</i> principle for the
judging of nature according to its possible particular
laws, makes the supersensible substrate (both in
us and without us) <i>determinable by means of the
intellectual faculty</i>. But the Reason by its practical
<i>a priori</i> law <i>determines</i> it; and thus the Judgement
makes possible the transition from the realm of the
concept of nature to that of the concept of freedom.</p>
<p>As regards the faculties of the soul in general,
in their higher aspect, as containing an autonomy;
the Understanding is that which contains the <i>constitutive</i>
principles <i>a priori</i> for the <i>cognitive faculty</i>
(the theoretical cognition of nature). For the <i>feeling
of pleasure and pain</i> there is the Judgement, independently
of concepts and sensations which relate to the
determination of the faculty of desire and can thus
be immediately practical. For the <i>faculty of desire</i>
there is the Reason which is practical without
the mediation of any pleasure whatever. It determines
for the faculty of desire, as a superior faculty,
the final purpose which carries with it the pure
intellectual satisfaction in the Object.—The concept
formed by Judgement of a purposiveness of
nature belongs to natural concepts, but only as
a regulative principle of the cognitive faculty;
although the aesthetical judgement upon certain
objects (of Nature or Art) which occasions it is,
in respect of the feeling of pleasure or pain, a
constitutive principle. The spontaneity in the play
of the cognitive faculties, the harmony of which
contains the ground of this pleasure, makes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
above concept [of the purposiveness of nature] fit to
be the mediating link between the realm of the
natural concept and that of the concept of freedom
in its effects; whilst at the same time it promotes
the sensibility of the mind for moral feeling.—The
following table may facilitate the review of all the
higher faculties according to their systematic unity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11" id="FNanchor_11">11</a></p>

<span class="subhead">OF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12" id="FNanchor_12">12</a> ACCORDING TO QUALITY</span></h4>
<h5 id="s1">§ 1. <i>The judgement of taste is aesthetical</i></h5>
<p>In order to decide whether anything is beautiful
or not, we refer the representation, not by the
Understanding to the Object for cognition but, by
the Imagination (perhaps in conjunction with the
Understanding) to the subject, and its feeling of
pleasure or pain. The judgement of taste is therefore
not a judgement of cognition, and is consequently
not logical but aesthetical, by which we
understand that whose determining ground can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
<i>no other than subjective</i>. Every reference of representations,
even that of sensations, may be objective
(and then it signifies the real in an empirical representation);
save only the reference to the feeling
of pleasure and pain, by which nothing in the
Object is signified, but through which there is
a feeling in the subject, as it is affected by the
representation.</p>
<p>To apprehend a regular, purposive building by
means of one’s cognitive faculty (whether in a
clear or a confused way of representation) is something
quite different from being conscious of this
representation as connected with the sensation of
satisfaction. Here the representation is altogether
referred to the subject and to its feeling of life, under
the name of the feeling of pleasure or pain. This
establishes a quite separate faculty of distinction
and of judgement, adding nothing to cognition, but
only comparing the given representation in the
subject with the whole faculty of representations, of
which the mind is conscious in the feeling of its
state. Given representations in a judgement can
be empirical (consequently, aesthetical); but the
judgement which is formed by means of them is
logical, provided they are referred in the judgement
to the Object. Conversely, if the given representations
are rational, but are referred in a judgement
simply to the subject (to its feeling), the judgement
is so far always aesthetical.</p>
<h5 id="s2">§ 2. <i>The satisfaction which determines the
judgement of taste is disinterested</i></h5>
<p>The satisfaction which we combine with the
representation of the existence of an object is called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
interest. Such satisfaction always has reference to
the faculty of desire, either as its determining ground
or as necessarily connected with its determining
ground. Now when the question is if a thing is
beautiful, we do not want to know whether anything
depends or can depend on the existence of the thing
either for myself or for any one else, but how we
judge it by mere observation (intuition or reflection).
If any one asks me if I find that palace beautiful
which I see before me, I may answer: I do not like
things of that kind which are made merely to be
stared at. Or I can answer like that Iroquois
<i>sachem</i> who was pleased in Paris by nothing more
than by the cook-shops. Or again after the manner
of <i>Rousseau</i> I may rebuke the vanity of the great
who waste the sweat of the people on such superfluous
things. In fine I could easily convince myself
that if I found myself on an uninhabited island without
the hope of ever again coming among men, and
could conjure up just such a splendid building by
my mere wish, I should not even give myself the
trouble if I had a sufficiently comfortable hut. This
may all be admitted and approved; but we are not now
talking of this. We wish only to know if this mere
representation of the object is accompanied in me
with satisfaction, however indifferent I may be as
regards the existence of the object of this representation.
We easily see that in saying it is <i>beautiful</i>
and in showing that I have taste, I am concerned, not
with that in which I depend on the existence of the
object, but with that which I make out of this representation
in myself. Every one must admit that
a judgement about beauty, in which the least interest
mingles, is very partial and is not a pure judgement
of taste. We must not be in the least prejudiced in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
favour of the existence of the things, but be quite
indifferent in this respect, in order to play the judge
in things of taste.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, better elucidate this proposition,
which is of capital importance, than by
contrasting the pure disinterested<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13" id="FNanchor_13">13</a> satisfaction in
judgements of taste, with that which is bound up with
an interest, especially if we can at the same time be
certain that there are no other kinds of interest than
those which are now to be specified.</p>
<h5 id="s3">§ 3. <i>The satisfaction in the</i> PLEASANT <i>is bound
up with interest</i></h5>
<p><i>That which pleases the senses in sensation is</i>
<span class="smcap smaller">PLEASANT</span>. Here the opportunity presents itself of
censuring a very common confusion of the double
sense which the word sensation can have, and of
calling attention to it. All satisfaction (it is said or
thought) is itself sensation (of a pleasure). Consequently
everything that pleases is pleasant because
it pleases (and according to its different degrees or
its relations to other pleasant sensations it is <i>agreeable</i>,
<i>lovely</i>, <i>delightful</i>, <i>enjoyable</i>, etc.). But if this
be admitted, then impressions of Sense which
determine the inclination, fundamental propositions
of Reason which determine the Will, mere reflective
forms of intuition which determine the Judgement,
are quite the same, as regards the effect upon the
feeling of pleasure. For this would be pleasantness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
in the sensation of one’s state, and since in the
end all the operations of our faculties must issue in
the practical and unite in it as their goal, we could
suppose no other way of estimating things and their
worth than that which consists in the gratification
that they promise. It is of no consequence at all
how this is attained, and since then the choice of
means alone could make a difference, men could
indeed blame one another for stupidity and indiscretion,
but never for baseness and wickedness.
For all, each according to his own way of seeing
things, seek one goal, that is, gratification.</p>
<p>If a determination of the feeling of pleasure or
pain is called sensation, this expression signifies
something quite different from what I mean when I
call the representation of a thing (by sense, as a
receptivity belonging to the cognitive faculty)
sensation. For in the latter case the representation
is referred to the Object, in the former simply to the
subject, and is available for no cognition whatever,
not even for that by which the subject <i>cognises</i> itself.</p>
<p>In the above elucidation we understand by the
word sensation, an objective representation of sense;
and in order to avoid misinterpretation, we shall call
that, which must always remain merely subjective
and can constitute absolutely no representation of
an object, by the ordinary term “feeling.” The
green colour of the meadows belongs to <i>objective</i>
sensation, as a perception of an object of sense; the
pleasantness of this belongs to <i>subjective</i> sensation
by which no object is represented, <i>i.e.</i> to feeling,
by which the object is considered as an Object of
satisfaction (which does not furnish a cognition of it).</p>
<p>Now that a judgement about an object, by which
I describe it as pleasant, expresses an interest in it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
is plain from the fact that by sensation it excites a
desire for objects of that kind; consequently the
satisfaction presupposes not the mere judgement
about it, but the relation of its existence to my state,
so far as this is affected by such an Object. Hence
we do not merely say of the pleasant, <i>it pleases</i>; but,
<i>it gratifies</i>. I give to it no mere approval, but inclination
is aroused by it; and in the case of what is
pleasant in the most lively fashion, there is no judgement
at all upon the character of the Object, for
those who always lay themselves out only for
enjoyment (for that is the word describing intense
gratification) would fain dispense with all judgement.</p>
<h5 id="s4">§ 4. <i>The satisfaction in the</i> <span class="smcap smaller">GOOD</span> <i>is bound up
with interest</i></h5>
<p>Whatever by means of Reason pleases through
the mere concept is <span class="smcap smaller">GOOD</span>. That which pleases only
as a means we call <i>good for something</i> (the useful);
but that which pleases for itself is <i>good in itself</i>. In
both there is always involved the concept of a
purpose, and consequently the relation of Reason to
the (at least possible) volition, and thus a satisfaction
in the <i>presence</i> of an Object or an action, <i>i.e.</i> some
kind of interest.</p>
<p>In order to find anything good, I must always
know what sort of a thing the object ought to be, <i>i.e.</i>
I must have a concept of it. But there is no need
of this, to find a thing beautiful. Flowers, free
delineations, outlines intertwined with one another
without design and called foliage, have no meaning,
depend on no definite concept, and yet they please.
The satisfaction in the beautiful must depend on the
reflection upon an object, leading to any concept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
(however indefinite); and it is thus distinguished
from the pleasant which rests entirely upon sensation.</p>
<p>It is true, the Pleasant seems in many cases to
be the same as the Good. Thus people are
accustomed to say that all gratification (especially if
it lasts) is good in itself; which is very much the
same as to say that lasting pleasure and the good
are the same. But we can soon see that this is
merely a confusion of words; for the concepts
which properly belong to these expressions can
in no way be interchanged. The pleasant, which,
as such, represents the object simply in relation
to Sense, must first be brought by the concept of
a purpose under principles of Reason, in order to
call it good, as an object of the Will. But that there
is [involved] a quite different relation to satisfaction
in calling that which gratifies at the same time <i>good</i>,
may be seen from the fact that in the case of the
good the question always is, whether it is mediately
or immediately good (useful or good in itself); but
on the contrary in the case of the pleasant there can
be no question about this at all, for the word always
signifies something which pleases immediately. (The
same is applicable to what I call beautiful.)</p>
<p>Even in common speech men distinguish the
Pleasant from the Good. Of a dish which stimulates
the taste by spices and other condiments we say unhesitatingly
that it is pleasant, though it is at the
same time admitted not to be good; for though it immediately
<i>delights</i> the senses, yet mediately, <i>i.e.</i> considered
by Reason which looks to the after results,
it displeases. Even in the judging of health we may
notice this distinction. It is immediately pleasant
to every one possessing it (at least negatively, <i>i.e.</i> as
the absence of all bodily pains). But in order to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
that it is good, it must be considered by Reason
with reference to purposes; viz. that it is a state
which makes us fit for all our business. Finally in
respect of happiness every one believes himself
entitled to describe the greatest sum of the pleasantnesses
of life (as regards both their number and their
duration) as a true, even as the highest, good.
However Reason is opposed to this. Pleasantness
is enjoyment. And if we were concerned with this
alone, it would be foolish to be scrupulous as regards
the means which procure it for us, or [to care]
whether it is obtained passively by the bounty of
nature or by our own activity and work. But
Reason can never be persuaded that the existence
of a man who merely lives for <i>enjoyment</i> (however
busy he may be in this point of view), has a worth
in itself; even if he at the same time is conducive as
a means to the best enjoyment of others, and shares
in all their gratifications by sympathy. Only what
he does, without reference to enjoyment, in full
freedom and independently of what nature can procure
for him passively, gives an [absolute<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14" id="FNanchor_14">14</a>] worth to
his being, as the existence of a person; and happiness,
with the whole abundance of its pleasures, is
far from being an unconditioned good.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15" id="FNanchor_15">15</a></p>
<p>However, notwithstanding all this difference between
the pleasant and the good, they both agree
in this that they are always bound up with an
interest in their object. [This is true] not only of
the pleasant(§ 3), and the mediate good (the useful)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
which is pleasing as a means towards pleasantness
somewhere, but also of that which is good absolutely
and in every aspect, viz. moral good, which brings
with it the highest interest. For the good is the
Object of will (<i>i.e.</i> of a faculty of desire determined
by Reason). But to will something, and to have a
satisfaction in its existence, <i>i.e.</i> to take an interest in
it, are identical.</p>
<h5 id="s5">§ 5. <i>Comparison of the three specifically different
kinds of satisfaction</i></h5>
<p>The pleasant and the good have both a reference
to the faculty of desire; and they bring with them—the
former a satisfaction pathologically conditioned
(by impulses, <i>stimuli</i>)—the latter a pure practical
satisfaction, which is determined not merely by the
representation of the object, but also by the represented
connexion of the subject with the existence
of the object. [It is not merely the object that
pleases, but also its existence.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16" id="FNanchor_16">16</a>] On the other hand,
the judgement of taste is merely <i>contemplative</i>; <i>i.e.</i>
it is a judgement which, indifferent as regards the
being of an object, compares its character with the
feeling of pleasure and pain. But this contemplation
itself is not directed to concepts; for the judgement
of taste is not a cognitive judgement (either theoretical
or practical), and thus is not <i>based</i> on concepts,
nor has it concepts as its <i>purpose</i>.</p>
<p>The Pleasant, the Beautiful, and the Good, designate
then, three different relations of representations
to the feeling of pleasure and pain, in reference to
which we distinguish from each other objects or
methods of representing them. And the expressions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
corresponding to each, by which we mark our complacency
in them, are not the same. That which
<span class="smcap smaller">GRATIFIES</span> a man is called <i>pleasant</i>; that which
merely <span class="smcap smaller">PLEASES</span> him is <i>beautiful</i>; that which is
<span class="smcap smaller">ESTEEMED</span> [or <i>approved</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17" id="FNanchor_17">17</a>] by him, <i>i.e.</i> that to which
he accords an objective worth, is <i>good</i>. Pleasantness
concerns irrational animals also; but Beauty only
concerns men, <i>i.e.</i> animal, but still rational, beings—not
merely <i>quâ</i> rational (<i>e.g.</i> spirits), but <i>quâ</i> animal
also; and the Good concerns every rational being
in general. This is a proposition which can only
be completely established and explained in the
sequel. We may say that of all these three kinds
of satisfaction, that of taste in the Beautiful is alone
a disinterested and <i>free</i> satisfaction; for no interest,
either of Sense or of Reason, here forces our assent.
Hence we may say of satisfaction that it is related
in the three aforesaid cases to <i>inclination</i>, to <i>favour</i>,
or to <i>respect</i>. Now <i>favour</i> is the only free satisfaction.
An object of inclination, and one that is
proposed to our desire by a law of Reason, leave us
no freedom in forming for ourselves anywhere an
object of pleasure. All interest presupposes or
generates a want; and, as the determining ground
of assent, it leaves the judgement about the object
no longer free.</p>
<p>As regards the interest of inclination in the case
of the Pleasant, every one says that hunger is the
best sauce, and everything that is eatable is relished
by people with a healthy appetite; and thus a satisfaction
of this sort does not indicate choice directed
by taste. It is only when the want is appeased that
we can distinguish which of many men has or has
not taste. In the same way there may be manners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
(conduct) without virtue, politeness without goodwill,
decorum without modesty, etc. For where the
moral law speaks there is no longer, objectively, a
free choice as regards what is to be done; and to
display taste in its fulfilment (or in judging of
another’s fulfilment of it) is something quite
different from manifesting the moral attitude of
thought. For this involves a command and generates
a want, whilst moral taste only plays with the
objects of satisfaction, without attaching itself to
one of them.</p>

<p>This explanation of the beautiful can be derived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
from the preceding explanation of it as the object of
an entirely disinterested satisfaction. For the fact
of which every one is conscious, that the satisfaction
is for him quite disinterested, implies in his judgement
a ground of satisfaction for every one. For
since it does not rest on any inclination of the
subject (nor upon any other premeditated interest),
but since he who judges feels himself quite <i>free</i> as
regards the satisfaction which he attaches to the
object, he cannot find the ground of this satisfaction
in any private conditions connected with his own
subject; and hence it must be regarded as grounded
on what he can presuppose in every other man.
Consequently he must believe that he has reason
for attributing a similar satisfaction to every one.
He will therefore speak of the beautiful, as if beauty
were a characteristic of the object and the judgement
logical (constituting a cognition of the Object by
means of concepts of it); although it is only
aesthetical and involves merely a reference of the
representation of the object to the subject. For it
has this similarity to a logical judgement that we
can presuppose its validity for every one. But this
universality cannot arise from concepts; for from
concepts there is no transition to the feeling of
pleasure or pain (except in pure practical laws,
which bring an interest with them such as is not
bound up with the pure judgement of taste). Consequently
the judgement of taste, accompanied with
the consciousness of separation from all interest, must
claim validity for every one, without this universality
depending on Objects. That is, there must be
bound up with it a title to subjective universality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s7">§ 7. <i>Comparison of the Beautiful with the Pleasant
and the Good by means of the above characteristic</i></h5>
<p>As regards the Pleasant every one is content
that his judgement, which he bases upon private
feeling, and by which he says of an object that it
pleases him, should be limited merely to his own
person. Thus he is quite contented that if he
says “Canary wine is pleasant,” another man may
correct his expression and remind him that he ought
to say “It is pleasant <i>to me</i>.” And this is the case
not only as regards the taste of the tongue, the
palate, and the throat, but for whatever is pleasant to
any one’s eyes and ears. To one violet colour is soft
and lovely, to another it is faded and dead. One
man likes the tone of wind instruments, another that
of strings. To strive here with the design of
reproving as incorrect another man’s judgement
which is different from our own, as if the judgements
were logically opposed, would be folly. As regards
the pleasant therefore the fundamental proposition
is valid, <i>every one has his own taste</i> (the taste of
Sense).</p>
<p>The case is quite different with the Beautiful.
It would (on the contrary) be laughable if a man
who imagined anything to his own taste, thought to
justify himself by saying: “This object (the house
we see, the coat that person wears, the concert we
hear, the poem submitted to our judgement) is
beautiful <i>for me</i>.” For he must not call it <i>beautiful</i>
if it merely pleases himself. Many things may have
for him charm and pleasantness; no one troubles himself
at that; but if he gives out anything as beautiful,
he supposes in others the same satisfaction—he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
judges not merely for himself, but for every one, and
speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things.
Hence he says “the <i>thing</i> is beautiful”; and he does
not count on the agreement of others with this his
judgement of satisfaction, because he has found this
agreement several times before, but he <i>demands</i> it of
them. He blames them if they judge otherwise and
he denies them taste, which he nevertheless requires
from them. Here then we cannot say that each man
has his own particular taste. For this would be as
much as to say that there is no taste whatever; <i>i.e.</i>
no aesthetical judgement, which can make a rightful
claim upon every one’s assent.</p>
<p>At the same time we find as regards the Pleasant
that there is an agreement among men in their
judgements upon it, in regard to which we deny Taste
to some and attribute it to others; by this not
meaning one of our organic senses, but a faculty
of judging in respect of the pleasant generally.
Thus we say of a man who knows how to entertain
his guests with pleasures (of enjoyment for all
the senses), so that they are all pleased, “he has
taste.” But here the universality is only taken
comparatively; and there emerge rules which are
only <i>general</i> (like all empirical ones), and not <i>universal</i>;
which latter the judgement of Taste upon
the beautiful undertakes or lays claim to. It is a
judgement in reference to sociability, so far as this
rests on empirical rules. In respect of the Good
it is true that judgements make rightful claim to
validity for every one; but the Good is represented
only <i>by means of a concept</i> as the Object of a
universal satisfaction, which is the case neither with
the Pleasant nor with the Beautiful.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s8">§ 8. <i>The universality of the satisfaction is represented
in a judgement of Taste only as subjective</i></h5>
<p>This particular determination of the universality
of an aesthetical judgement, which is to be met with
in a judgement of taste, is noteworthy, not indeed for
the logician, but for the transcendental philosopher.
It requires no small trouble to discover its origin,
but we thus detect a property of our cognitive
faculty which without this analysis would remain
unknown.</p>
<p>First, we must be fully convinced of the fact
that in a judgement of taste (about the Beautiful)
the satisfaction in the object is imputed to <i>every one</i>,
without being based on a concept (for then it would
be the Good). Further, this claim to universal
validity so essentially belongs to a judgement by
which we describe anything as <i>beautiful</i>, that if
this were not thought in it, it would never come
into our thoughts to use the expression at all,
but everything which pleases without a concept
would be counted as pleasant. In respect of the
latter every one has his own opinion; and no one
assumes, in another, agreement with his judgement
of taste, which is always the case in a judgement
of taste about beauty. I may call the first the taste
of Sense, the second the taste of Reflection; so
far as the first lays down mere private judgements,
and the second judgements supposed to be generally
valid (public), but in both cases aesthetical (not practical)
judgements about an object merely in respect
of the relation of its representation to the feeling
of pleasure and pain. Now here is something
strange. As regards the taste of Sense not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
does experience show that its judgement (of pleasure
or pain connected with anything) is not valid universally,
but every one is content not to impute agreement
with it to others (although actually there
is often found a very extended concurrence in
these judgements). On the other hand, the taste
of Reflection has its claim to the universal validity
of its judgements (about the beautiful) rejected often
enough, as experience teaches; although it may find
it possible (as it actually does) to represent judgements
which can demand this universal agreement.
In fact for each of its judgements of taste it imputes
this to every one, without the persons that judge
disputing as to the possibility of such a claim;
although in particular cases they cannot agree as to
the correct application of this faculty.</p>
<p>Here we must, in the first place, remark that a
universality which does not rest on concepts of
Objects (not even on empirical ones) is not logical
but aesthetical, <i>i.e.</i> it involves no objective quantity
of the judgement but only that which is subjective.
For this I use the expression <i>general validity</i> which
signifies the validity of the reference of a representation,
not to the cognitive faculty but, to the feeling
of pleasure and pain for every subject. (We can
avail ourselves also of the same expression for the
logical quantity of the judgement, if only we prefix
<i>objective</i> to “universal validity,” to distinguish it
from that which is merely subjective and aesthetical.)</p>
<p>A judgement with <i>objective universal validity</i>
is also always valid subjectively; <i>i.e.</i> if the judgement
holds for everything contained under a given
concept, it holds also for every one who represents
an object by means of this concept. But from a
<i>subjective universal validity</i>, <i>i.e.</i> aesthetical and resting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
on no concept, we cannot infer that which is
logical; because that kind of judgement does not
extend to the Object. Hence the aesthetical
universality which is ascribed to a judgement must
be of a particular kind, because it does not unite
the predicate of beauty with the concept of the
<i>Object</i>, considered in its whole logical sphere, and
yet extends it to the whole sphere of judging
persons.</p>
<p>In respect of logical quantity all judgements of
taste are <i>singular</i> judgements. For because I must
refer the object immediately to my feeling of pleasure
and pain, and that not by means of concepts, they
cannot have the quantity of objective generally
valid judgements. Nevertheless if the singular representation
of the Object of the judgement of taste
in accordance with the conditions determining the
latter, were transformed by comparison into a concept,
a logically universal judgement could result therefrom.
<i>E.g.</i> I describe by a judgement of taste the
rose, that I see, as beautiful. But the judgement
which results from the comparison of several singular
judgements, “Roses in general are beautiful” is no
longer described simply as aesthetical, but as a logical
judgement based on an aesthetical one. Again the
judgement “The rose is pleasant” (to smell) is,
although aesthetical and singular, not a judgement
of Taste but of Sense. It is distinguished from the
former by the fact that the judgement of Taste carries
with it an <i>aesthetical quantity</i> of universality, <i>i.e.</i> of
validity for every one; which cannot be found in a
judgement about the Pleasant. It is only judgements
about the Good which—although they also determine
satisfaction in an object,—have logical and not merely
aesthetical universality; for they are valid of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Object, as cognitive of it, and thus are valid for every
one.</p>
<p>If we judge Objects merely according to concepts,
then all representation of beauty is lost.
Thus there can be no rule according to which
any one is to be forced to recognise anything as
beautiful. We cannot press [upon others] by the
aid of any reasons or fundamental propositions
our judgement that a coat, a house, or a flower is
beautiful. We wish to submit the Object to
our own eyes, as if the satisfaction in it depended
on sensation; and yet if we then call the object
beautiful, we believe that we speak with a universal
voice, and we claim the assent of every one, although
on the contrary all private sensation can only decide
for the observer himself and his satisfaction.</p>
<p>We may see now that in the judgement of taste
nothing is postulated but such a <i>universal voice</i>,
in respect of the satisfaction without the intervention
of concepts; and thus the <i>possibility</i> of an aesthetical
judgement that can, at the same time, be regarded
as valid for every one. The judgement of taste itself
does not <i>postulate</i> the agreement of every one (for
that can only be done by a logically universal judgement
because it can adduce reasons); it only <i>imputes</i>
this agreement to every one, as a case of the
rule in respect of which it expects, not confirmation
by concepts, but assent from others. The
universal voice is, therefore, only an Idea (we do
not yet inquire upon what it rests). It may be
uncertain whether or not the man, who believes that
he is laying down a judgement of taste, is, as a matter
of fact, judging in conformity with that Idea; but
that he refers his judgement thereto, and, consequently,
that it is intended to be a judgement of taste, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
announces by the expression “beauty.” He can
be quite certain of this for himself by the mere
consciousness of the separation of everything belonging
to the Pleasant and the Good from the
satisfaction which is left; and this is all for which he
promises himself the agreement of every one—a claim
which would be justifiable under these conditions,
provided only he did not often make mistakes, and
thus lay down an erroneous judgement of taste.</p>
<h5 id="s9">§ 9. <i>Investigation of the question whether in the
judgement of taste the feeling of pleasure precedes
or follows the judging of the object</i></h5>
<p>The solution of this question is the key to the
Critique of Taste, and so is worthy of all attention.</p>
<p>If the pleasure in the given object precedes,
and it is only its universal communicability that is
to be acknowledged in the judgement of taste about
the representation of the object, there would be a
contradiction. For such pleasure would be nothing
different from the mere pleasantness in the sensation,
and so in accordance with its nature could have only
private validity, because it is immediately dependent
on the representation through which the object <i>is
given</i>.</p>
<p>Hence, it is the universal capability of communication
of the mental state in the given representation
which, as the subjective condition of
the judgement of taste, must be fundamental, and
must have the pleasure in the object as its consequent.
But nothing can be universally communicated
except cognition and representation, so
far as it belongs to cognition. For it is only thus
that this latter can be objective; and only through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
this has it a universal point of reference, with which
the representative power of every one is compelled
to harmonise. If the determining ground of our
judgement as to this universal communicability of the
representation is to be merely subjective, <i>i.e.</i> is conceived
independently of any concept of the object,
it can be nothing else than the state of mind, which
is to be met with in the relation of our representative
powers to each other, so far as they refer a given
representation to <i>cognition in general</i>.</p>
<p>The cognitive powers, which are involved by
this representation, are here in free play, because
no definite concept limits them to a particular<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19" id="FNanchor_19">19</a> rule
of cognition. Hence, the state of mind in this
representation must be a feeling of the free play
of the representative powers in a given representation
with reference to a cognition in general. Now
a representation by which an object is given,
that is to become a cognition in general, requires
<i>Imagination</i>, for the gathering together the manifold
of intuition, and <i>Understanding</i>, for the unity of
the concept uniting the representations. This state
of <i>free play</i> of the cognitive faculties in a representation
by which an object is given, must be
universally communicable; because cognition, as
the determination of the Object with which given
representations (in whatever subject) are to agree,
is the only kind of representation which is valid
for every one.</p>
<p>The subjective universal communicability of the
mode of representation in a judgement of taste,
since it is to be possible without presupposing a
definite concept, can refer to nothing else than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
state of mind in the free play of the Imagination
and the Understanding (so far as they agree with
each other, as is requisite for <i>cognition in general</i>).
We are conscious that this subjective relation,
suitable for cognition in general, must be valid for
every one, and thus must be universally communicable,
just as if it were a definite cognition,
resting always on that relation as its subjective
condition.</p>
<p>This merely subjective (aesthetical) judging of the
object, or of the representation by which it is given,
precedes the pleasure in it, and is the ground of this
pleasure in the harmony of the cognitive faculties;
but on the universality of the subjective conditions
for judging of objects is alone based the universal
subjective validity of the satisfaction bound up by
us with the representation of the object that we call
beautiful.</p>
<p>The power of communicating one’s state of mind,
even though only in respect of the cognitive faculties,
carries a pleasure with it, as we can easily show from
the natural propension of man towards sociability
(empirical and psychological). But this is not
enough for our design. The pleasure that we feel
is, in a judgement of taste, necessarily imputed by
us to every one else; as if, when we call a thing
beautiful, it is to be regarded as a characteristic of
the object which is determined in it according to
concepts; though beauty, without a reference to the
feeling of the subject, is nothing by itself. But we
must reserve the examination of this question until
we have answered another, viz. “If and how
aesthetical judgements are possible <i>a priori</i>?”</p>
<p>We now occupy ourselves with the easier question,
in what way we are conscious of a mutual subjective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
harmony of the cognitive powers with one another
in the judgement of taste; is it aesthetically by mere
internal sense and sensation? or is it intellectually
by the consciousness of our designed activity, by
which we bring them into play?</p>
<p>If the given representation, which occasions the
judgement of taste, were a concept uniting Understanding
and Imagination in the judging of the
object, into a cognition of the Object, the consciousness
of this relation would be intellectual (as in the
objective schematism of the Judgement of which
the Critique<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20" id="FNanchor_20">20</a> treats). But then the judgement
would not be laid down in reference to pleasure and
pain, and consequently would not be a judgement of
taste. But the judgement of taste, independently
of concepts, determines the Object in respect of
satisfaction and of the predicate of beauty. Therefore
that subjective unity of relation can only make
itself known by means of sensation. The excitement
of both faculties (Imagination and Understanding)
to indeterminate, but yet, through the stimulus of
the given sensation, harmonious activity, viz. that
which belongs to cognition in general, is the sensation
whose universal communicability is postulated
by the judgement of taste. An objective relation
can only be thought, but yet, so far as it is subjective
according to its conditions, can be felt in its effect
on the mind; and, of a relation based on no concept
(like the relation of the representative powers to a
cognitive faculty in general), no other consciousness
is possible than that through the sensation of the
effect, which consists in the more lively play of both
mental powers (the Imagination and the Understanding)
when animated by mutual agreement. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
representation which, as singular and apart from comparison
with others, yet has an agreement with the
conditions of universality which it is the business of
the Understanding to supply, brings the cognitive
faculties into that proportionate accord which we
require for all cognition, and so regard as holding
for every one who is determined to judge by means
of Understanding and Sense in combination (<i>i.e.</i> for
every man).</p>

<span class="subhead">OF JUDGEMENTS OF TASTE, ACCORDING TO THE
RELATION OF THE PURPOSES WHICH ARE
BROUGHT INTO CONSIDERATION THEREIN.</span></h4>
<h5 id="s10">§ 10. <i>Of purposiveness in general</i></h5>
<p>If we wish to explain what a purpose is according
to its transcendental determinations (without
presupposing anything empirical like the feeling of
pleasure) [we say that] the purpose is the object of
a concept, in so far as the concept is regarded as
the cause of the object (the real ground of its
possibility); and the causality of a <i>concept</i> in respect
of its <i>Object</i> is its purposiveness (<i>forma finalis</i>).
Where then not merely the cognition of an object,
but the object itself (its form and existence) is
thought as an effect only possible by means of the
concept of this latter, there we think a purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The representation of the effect is here the determining
ground of its cause and precedes it. The
consciousness of the causality of a representation, for
<i>maintaining</i> the subject in the same state, may here
generally denote what we call pleasure; while on
the other hand pain is that representation which
contains the ground of the determination of the
state of representations into their opposite [of
restraining or removing them<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21" id="FNanchor_21">21</a>].</p>
<p>The faculty of desire, so far as it is determinable
only through concepts, <i>i.e.</i> to act in conformity with
the representation of a purpose, would be the Will.
But an Object, or a state of mind, or even an action,
is called purposive, although its possibility does not
necessarily presuppose the representation of a purpose,
merely because its possibility can be explained
and conceived by us only so far as we assume for its
ground a causality according to purposes, <i>i.e.</i> a will
which would have so disposed it according to the
representation of a certain rule. There can be, then,
purposiveness without<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22" id="FNanchor_22">22</a> purpose, so far as we do not
place the causes of this form in a will, but yet can
only make the explanation of its possibility intelligible
to ourselves by deriving it from a will.
Again, we are not always forced to regard what we
observe (in respect of its possibility) from the point
of view of Reason. Thus we can at least observe a
purposiveness according to form, without basing it
on a purpose (as the material of the <i>nexus finalis</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and we can notice it in objects, although only by
reflection.</p>
<h5 id="s11">§ 11. <i>The judgement of taste has nothing at its
basis but the</i> form of the purposiveness <i>of an
object (or of its mode of representation)</i></h5>
<p>Every purpose, if it be regarded as a ground of
satisfaction, always carries with it an interest—as
the determining ground of the judgement—about
the object of pleasure. Therefore no subjective
purpose can lie at the basis of the judgement of
taste. But neither can the judgement of taste be
determined by any representation of an objective
purpose, <i>i.e.</i> of the possibility of the object itself in
accordance with principles of purposive combination,
and consequently it can be determined by no concept
of the good; because it is an aesthetical and
not a cognitive judgement. It therefore has to do
with no <i>concept</i> of the character and internal or
external possibility of the object by means of this
or that cause, but merely with the relation of the
representative powers to one another, so far as they
are determined by a representation.</p>
<p>Now this relation in the determination of an
object as beautiful is bound up with the feeling of
pleasure, which is declared by the judgement of taste
to be valid for every one; hence a pleasantness,
accompanying the representation, can as little contain
the determining ground [of the judgement] as
the representation of the perfection of the object and
the concept of the good can. Therefore it can be
nothing else than the subjective purposiveness in the
representation of an object without any purpose
(either objective or subjective); and thus it is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
mere form of purposiveness in the representation by
which an object is <i>given</i> to us, so far as we are
conscious of it, which constitutes the satisfaction
that we without a concept judge to be universally
communicable; and, consequently, this is the determining
ground of the judgement of taste.</p>
<h5 id="s12">§ 12. <i>The judgement of taste rests on</i> a priori
<i>grounds</i></h5>
<p>To establish <i>a priori</i> the connexion of the
feeling of a pleasure or pain as an effect, with any
representation whatever (sensation or concept) as its
cause, is absolutely impossible; for that would be a
[particular]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23" id="FNanchor_23">23</a> causal relation which (with objects of
experience) can always only be cognised <i>a posteriori</i>,
and through the medium of experience itself. We
actually have, indeed, in the Critique of practical
Reason, derived from universal moral concepts
<i>a priori</i> the feeling of respect (as a special and
peculiar modification of feeling which will not
strictly correspond either to the pleasure or the
pain that we get from empirical objects). But
there we could go beyond the bounds of experience
and call in a causality which rested on a supersensible
attribute of the subject, viz. freedom. And
even there, properly speaking, it was not this <i>feeling</i>
which we derived from the Idea of the moral as
cause, but merely the determination of the will.
But the state of mind which accompanies any
determination of the will is in itself a feeling of
pleasure and identical with it, and therefore does
not follow from it as its effect. This last must only
be assumed if the concept of the moral as a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
precede the determination of the will by the law; for
in that case the pleasure that is bound up with the
concept could not be derived from it as from a mere
cognition.</p>
<p>Now the case is similar with the pleasure in
aesthetical judgements, only that here it is merely
contemplative and does not bring about an interest
in the Object, which on the other hand in the moral
judgement it is practical.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24" id="FNanchor_24">24</a> The consciousness of the
mere formal purposiveness in the play of the subject’s
cognitive powers, in a representation through which
an object is given, is the pleasure itself; because it
contains a determining ground of the activity of the
subject in respect of the excitement of its cognitive
powers, and therefore an inner causality (which is
purposive) in respect of cognition in general without
however being limited to any definite cognition; and
consequently contains a mere form of the subjective
purposiveness of a representation in an aesthetical
judgement. This pleasure is in no way practical,
neither like that arising from the pathological
ground of pleasantness, nor that from the intellectual
ground of the represented good. But yet it involves
causality, viz. of <i>maintaining</i> the state of the representation
itself, and the exercise of the cognitive
powers without further design. We <i>linger</i> over the
contemplation of the beautiful, because this contemplation
strengthens and reproduces itself, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
is analogous to (though not of the same kind as)
that lingering which takes place when a [physical]
charm in the representation of the object repeatedly
arouses the attention, the mind being passive.</p>
<h5 id="s13">§ 13. <i>The pure judgement of taste is independent
of charm and emotion</i></h5>
<p>Every interest spoils the judgement of taste and
takes from its impartiality, especially if the purposiveness
is not, as with the interest of Reason,
placed before the feeling of pleasure but grounded
on it. This last always happens in an aesthetical
judgement upon anything so far as it gratifies or
grieves us. Hence judgements so affected can lay
no claim at all to a universally valid satisfaction, or
at least so much the less claim, in proportion as
there are sensations of this sort among the determining
grounds of taste. That taste is still
barbaric which needs a mixture of <i>charms</i> and
<i>emotions</i> in order that there may be satisfaction, and
still more so if it make these the measure of its
assent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless charms are often not only taken
account of in the case of beauty (which properly
speaking ought merely to be concerned with form) as
contributory to the aesthetical universal satisfaction;
but they are passed off as in themselves beauties,
and thus the matter of satisfaction is substituted for
the form. This misconception, however, like so
many others which have something true at their
basis, may be removed by a careful definition of
these concepts.</p>
<p>A judgement of taste on which charm and emotion
have no influence (although they may be bound up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
with the satisfaction in the beautiful),—which therefore
has as its determining ground merely the purposiveness
of the form,—is a <i>pure judgement of taste</i>.</p>
<h5 id="s14">§ 14. <i>Elucidation by means of examples</i></h5>
<p>Aesthetical judgements can be divided just like
theoretical (logical) judgements into empirical and
pure. The first assert pleasantness or unpleasantness;
the second assert the beauty of an object or
of the manner of representing it. The former are
judgements of Sense (material aesthetical judgements);
the latter [as formal<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25" id="FNanchor_25">25</a>] are alone strictly
judgements of Taste.</p>
<p>A judgement of taste is therefore pure, only so
far as no merely empirical satisfaction is mingled
with its determining ground. But this always
happens if charm or emotion have any share in the
judgement by which anything is to be described as
beautiful.</p>
<p>Now here many objections present themselves,
which fallaciously put forward charm not merely as
a necessary ingredient of beauty, but as alone
sufficient [to justify] a thing’s being called beautiful.
A mere colour, <i>e.g.</i> the green of a grass plot, a mere
tone (as distinguished from sound and noise) like
that of a violin, are by most people described as
beautiful in themselves; although both seem to have
at their basis merely the matter of representations,
viz. simply sensation, and therefore only deserve to
be called pleasant. But we must at the same time
remark that the sensations of colours and of tone
have a right to be regarded as beautiful only in so
far as they are <i>pure</i>. This is a determination which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
concerns their form, and is the only [element] of
these representations which admits with certainty of
universal communicability; for we cannot assume
that the quality of sensations is the same in all
subjects, and we can hardly say that the pleasantness
of one colour or the tone of one musical instrument
is judged preferable to that of another in the same<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26" id="FNanchor_26">26</a>
way by every one.</p>
<p>If we assume with <i>Euler</i> that colours are isochronous
vibrations (<i>pulsus</i>) of the aether, as sounds
are of the air in a state of disturbance, and,—what
is most important,—that the mind not only perceives
by sense the effect of these in exciting the
organ, but also perceives by reflection the regular
play of impressions (and thus the form of the combination
of different representations) which I still
do not doubt<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27" id="FNanchor_27">27</a>—then colours and tone cannot be
reckoned as mere sensations, but as the formal
determination of the unity of a manifold of sensations,
and thus as beauties in themselves.</p>
<p>But “pure” in a simple mode of sensation means
that its uniformity is troubled and interrupted by no
foreign sensation, and it belongs merely to the form;
because here we can abstract from the quality of
that mode of sensation (abstract from the colours
and tone, if any, which it represents). Hence all
simple colours, so far as they are pure, are regarded
as beautiful; composite colours have not this advantage,
because, as they are not simple, we have no
standard for judging whether they should be called
pure or not.</p>
<p>But as regards the beauty attributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
object on account of its form, to suppose it to be
capable of augmentation through the charm of the
object is a common error, and one very prejudicial
to genuine, uncorrupted, well-founded taste. We
can doubtless add these charms to beauty, in order
to interest the mind by the representation of the
object, apart from the bare satisfaction [received];
and thus they may serve as a recommendation of
taste and its cultivation, especially when it is yet
crude and unexercised. But they actually do injury
to the judgement of taste if they draw attention to
themselves as the grounds for judging of beauty. So
far are they from adding to beauty that they must
only be admitted by indulgence as aliens; and provided
always that they do not disturb the beautiful
form, in cases when taste is yet weak and untrained.</p>
<p>In painting, sculpture, and in all the formative
arts—in architecture, and horticulture, so far as they
are beautiful arts—the <i>delineation</i> is the essential
thing; and here it is not what gratifies in sensation
but what pleases by means of its form that is fundamental
for taste. The colours which light up the
sketch belong to the charm; they may indeed enliven<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28" id="FNanchor_28">28</a>
the object for sensation, but they cannot make
it worthy of contemplation and beautiful. In most
cases they are rather limited by the requirements of
the beautiful form; and even where charm is permissible
it is ennobled solely by this.</p>
<p>Every form of the objects of sense (both of
external sense and also mediately of internal) is
either <i>figure</i> or <i>play</i>. In the latter case it is either
play of figures (in space, viz. pantomime and
dancing), or the mere play of sensations (in time).
The <i>charm</i> of colours or of the pleasant tones of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
instrument may be added; but the <i>delineation</i> in the
first case and the composition in the second constitute
the proper object of the pure judgement of taste.
To say that the purity of colours and of tones, or
their variety and contrast, seems to add to beauty,
does not mean that they supply a homogeneous
addition to our satisfaction in the form because they
are pleasant in themselves; but they do so, because
they make the form more exactly, definitely, and
completely, intuitible, and besides by their charm
[excite the representation, whilst they<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29" id="FNanchor_29">29</a>] awaken and
fix our attention on the object itself.</p>
<p>Even what we call <i>ornaments</i> [parerga<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29">29</a>], <i>i.e.</i>
those things which do not belong to the complete
representation of the object internally as elements
but only externally as complements, and which
augment the satisfaction of taste, do so only by their
form; as for example [the frames of pictures,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29">29</a> or]
the draperies of statues or the colonnades of palaces.
But if the ornament does not itself consist in beautiful
form, and if it is used as a golden frame is used,
merely to recommend the painting by its <i>charm</i>, it
is then called <i>finery</i> and injures genuine beauty.</p>
<p><i>Emotion</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a sensation in which pleasantness
is produced by means of a momentary checking and
a consequent more powerful outflow of the vital
force, does not belong at all to beauty. But
sublimity [with which the feeling of emotion is
bound up<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29">29</a>] requires a different standard of judgement
from that which is at the foundation of taste;
and thus a pure judgement of taste has for its determining
ground neither charm nor emotion, in a
word, no sensation as the material of the aesthetical
judgement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s15">§ 15. <i>The judgement of taste is quite independent
of the concept of perfection</i></h5>
<p><i>Objective</i> purposiveness can only be cognised by
means of the reference of the manifold to a definite
purpose, and therefore only through a concept.
From this alone it is plain that the Beautiful, the
judging of which has at its basis a merely formal
purposiveness, <i>i.e.</i> a purposiveness without purpose,
is quite independent of the concept of the Good;
because the latter presupposes an objective purposiveness,
<i>i.e.</i> the reference of the object to a
definite purpose.</p>
<p>Objective purposiveness is either external, <i>i.e.</i>
the <i>utility</i>, or internal, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>perfection</i> of the
object. That the satisfaction in an object, on
account of which we call it beautiful, cannot rest
on the representation of its utility, is sufficiently
obvious from the two preceding sections; because
in that case it would not be an immediate satisfaction
in the object, which is the essential condition
of a judgement about beauty. But objective internal
purposiveness, <i>i.e.</i> perfection, comes nearer to the
predicate of beauty; and it has been regarded by
celebrated philosophers<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30" id="FNanchor_30">30</a> as the same as beauty,
with the proviso, <i>if it is thought in a confused way</i>.
It is of the greatest importance in a Critique of Taste
to decide whether beauty can thus actually be
resolved into the concept of perfection.</p>
<p>To judge of objective purposiveness we always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
need not only the concept of a purpose, but (if that
purposiveness is not to be external utility but
internal) the concept of an internal purpose which
shall contain the ground of the internal possibility
of the object. Now as a purpose in general is that
whose <i>concept</i> can be regarded as the ground of the
possibility of the object itself; so, in order to
represent objective purposiveness in a thing, the
concept of <i>what sort of thing it is to be</i> must come
first. The agreement of the manifold in it with
this concept (which furnishes the rule for combining
the manifold) is the <i>qualitative perfection</i> of the
thing. Quite different from this is <i>quantitative</i> perfection,
the completeness of a thing after its kind,
which is a mere concept of magnitude (of totality).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31" id="FNanchor_31">31</a>
In this <i>what the thing ought to be</i> is conceived as
already determined, and it is only asked if it has
<i>all</i> its requisites. The formal [element] in the representation
of a thing, <i>i.e.</i> the agreement of the manifold
with a unity (it being undetermined what this ought
to be), gives to cognition no objective purposiveness
whatever. For since abstraction is made of this
unity as <i>purpose</i> (what the thing ought to be),
nothing remains but the subjective purposiveness
of the representations in the mind of the intuiting
subject. And this, although it furnishes a certain
purposiveness of the representative state of the
subject, and so a facility of apprehending a given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
form by the Imagination, yet furnishes no perfection
of an Object, since the Object is not here conceived
by means of the concept of a purpose. For example,
if in a forest I come across a plot of sward, round
which trees stand in a circle, and do not then represent
to myself a purpose, viz. that it is intended to serve
for country dances, not the least concept of perfection
is furnished by the mere form. But to
represent to oneself a formal <i>objective</i> purposiveness
without purpose, <i>i.e.</i> the mere form of a <i>perfection</i>
(without any matter and without the <i>concept</i> of that
with which it is accordant, even if it were merely
the Idea of conformity to law in general<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32" id="FNanchor_32">32</a>) is a
veritable contradiction.</p>
<p>Now the judgement of taste is an aesthetical
judgement, <i>i.e.</i> such as rests on subjective grounds,
the determining ground of which cannot be a concept,
and consequently cannot be the concept of a
definite purpose. Therefore in beauty, regarded
as a formal subjective purposiveness, there is in no
way thought a perfection of the object, as a would-be
formal purposiveness, which yet is objective.
And thus to distinguish between the concepts of
the Beautiful and the Good, as if they were only
different in logical form, the first being a confused,
the second a clear concept of perfection, but
identical in content and origin, is quite fallacious.
For then there would be no <i>specific</i> difference
between them, but a judgement of taste would be
as much a cognitive judgement as the judgement by
which a thing is described as good; just as when
the ordinary man says that fraud is unjust he bases
his judgement on confused grounds, whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
philosopher bases it on clear grounds, but both on
identical principles of Reason. I have already,
however, said that an aesthetical judgement is unique
of its kind, and gives absolutely no cognition (not
even a confused cognition) of the Object; this is only
supplied by a logical judgement. On the contrary,
it simply refers the representation, by which an
Object is given, to the subject; and brings to our
notice no characteristic of the object, but only the
purposive form in the determination of the representative
powers which are occupying themselves
therewith. The judgement is called aesthetical just
because its determining ground is not a concept,
but the feeling (of internal sense) of that harmony in
the play of the mental powers, so far as it can be felt
in sensation. On the other hand, if we wish to call
confused concepts and the objective judgement based
on them, aesthetical, we shall have an Understanding
judging sensibly or a Sense representing its
Objects by means of concepts [both of which are
contradictory.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33" id="FNanchor_33">33</a>] The faculty of concepts, be they
confused or clear, is the Understanding; and although
Understanding has to do with the judgement
of taste, as an aesthetical judgement (as it has with all
judgements), yet it has to do with it not as a faculty
by which an object is cognised, but as the faculty
which determines the judgement and its representation
(without any concept) in accordance with its
relation to the subject and the subject’s internal
feeling, in so far as this judgement may be possible
in accordance with a universal rule.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s16">§ 16. <i>The judgement of taste, by which an object is
declared to be beautiful under the condition of a
definite concept, is not pure</i></h5>
<p>There are two kinds of beauty; free beauty
(<i>pulchritudo vaga</i>) or merely dependent beauty
(<i>pulchritudo adhaerens</i>). The first presupposes no
concept of what the object ought to be; the second
does presuppose such a concept and the perfection
of the object in accordance therewith. The first is
called the (self-subsistent) beauty of this or that
thing; the second, as dependent upon a concept
(conditioned beauty), is ascribed to Objects which
come under the concept of a particular purpose.</p>
<p>Flowers are free natural beauties. Hardly any
one but a botanist knows what sort of a thing a
flower ought to be; and even he, though recognising
in the flower the reproductive organ of the
plant, pays no regard to this natural purpose if
he is passing judgement on the flower by Taste.
There is then at the basis of this judgement no
perfection of any kind, no internal purposiveness,
to which the collection of the manifold is referred.
Many birds (such as the parrot, the humming bird,
the bird of paradise), and many sea shells are
beauties in themselves, which do not belong to any
object determined in respect of its purpose by
concepts, but please freely and in themselves. So
also delineations <i>à la grecque</i>, foliage for borders
or wall-papers, mean nothing in themselves; they
represent nothing—no Object under a definite
concept,—and are free beauties. We can refer to
the same class what are called in music phantasies
(<i>i.e.</i> pieces without any theme), and in fact all music
without words.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
In the judging of a free beauty (according to the
mere form) the judgement of taste is pure. There
is presupposed no concept of any purpose, for which
the manifold should serve the given Object, and
which therefore is to be represented therein. By
such a concept the freedom of the Imagination which
disports itself in the contemplation of the figure
would be only limited.</p>
<p>But human beauty (<i>i.e.</i> of a man, a woman, or
a child), the beauty of a horse, or a building (be
it church, palace, arsenal, or summer-house) presupposes
a concept of the purpose which determines
what the thing is to be, and consequently a concept
of its perfection; it is therefore adherent beauty.
Now as the combination of the Pleasant (in sensation)
with Beauty, which properly is only concerned with
form, is a hindrance to the purity of the judgement
of taste; so also is its purity injured by the combination
with Beauty of the Good (viz. that manifold
which is good for the thing itself in accordance
with its purpose).</p>
<p>We could add much to a building which would
immediately please the eye, if only it were not to
be a church. We could adorn a figure with all
kinds of spirals and light but regular lines, as the
New Zealanders do with their tattooing, if only it
were not the figure of a human being. And again
this could have much finer features and a more
pleasing and gentle cast of countenance provided
it were not intended to represent a man, much less
a warrior.</p>
<p>Now the satisfaction in the manifold of a thing
in reference to the internal purpose which determines
its possibility is a satisfaction grounded on a concept;
but the satisfaction in beauty is such as presupposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
no concept, but is immediately bound up with the
representation through which the object is given
(not through which it is thought). If now the judgement
of Taste in respect of the beauty of a thing is
made dependent on the purpose in its manifold, like
a judgement of Reason, and thus limited, it is no
longer a free and pure judgement of Taste.</p>
<p>It is true that taste gains by this combination of
aesthetical with intellectual satisfaction, inasmuch as
it becomes fixed; and though it is not universal, yet
in respect to certain purposively determined Objects
it becomes possible to prescribe rules for it. These,
however, are not rules of taste, but merely rules for
the unification of Taste with Reason, <i>i.e.</i> of the
Beautiful with the Good, by which the former
becomes available as an instrument of design in
respect of the latter. Thus the tone of mind which
is self-maintaining and of subjective universal validity
is subordinated to the way of thinking which can be
maintained only by painful resolve, but is of objective
universal validity. Properly speaking, however, perfection
gains nothing by beauty or beauty by perfection;
but, when we compare the representation
by which an object is given to us with the Object
(as regards what it ought to be) by means of a
concept, we cannot avoid considering along with it
the sensation in the subject. And thus when both
states of mind are in harmony our <i>whole faculty</i> of
representative power gains.</p>
<p>A judgement of taste, then, in respect of an object
with a definite internal purpose, can only be pure,
if either the person judging has no concept of this
purpose, or else abstracts from it in his judgement.
Such a person, although forming an accurate judgement
of taste in judging of the object as free beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
would yet by another who considers the beauty in
it only as a dependent attribute (who looks to the
purpose of the object) be blamed, and accused of
false taste; although both are right in their own
way, the one in reference to what he has before
his eyes, the other in reference to what he has in
his thought. By means of this distinction we can
settle many disputes about beauty between judges
of taste; by showing that the one is speaking of
free, the other of dependent, beauty,—that the first
is making a pure, the second an applied, judgement
of taste.</p>
<h5 id="s17">§ 17. <i>Of the Ideal of beauty</i></h5>
<p>There can be no objective rule of taste which
shall determine by means of concepts what is
beautiful. For every judgement from this source
is aesthetical; <i>i.e.</i> the feeling of the subject, and not
a concept of the Object, is its determining ground.
To seek for a principle of taste which shall furnish,
by means of definite concepts, a universal criterion
of the beautiful, is fruitless trouble; because what
is sought is impossible and self-contradictory. The
universal communicability of sensation (satisfaction
or dissatisfaction) without the aid of a concept—the
agreement, as far as is possible, of all times and
peoples as regards this feeling in the representation
of certain objects—this is the empirical criterion,
although weak and hardly sufficing for probability,
of the derivation of a taste, thus confirmed by
examples, from the deep-lying grounds of agreement
common to all men, in judging of the forms under
which objects are given to them.</p>
<p>Hence, we consider some products of taste as
<i>exemplary</i>. Not that taste can be acquired by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
imitating others; for it must be an original faculty.
He who imitates a model shows, no doubt, in so
far as he attains to it, skill; but only shows taste
in so far as he can judge of this model itself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34" id="FNanchor_34">34</a> It
follows from hence that the highest model, the
archetype of taste, is a mere Idea, which every one
must produce in himself; and according to which
he must judge every Object of taste, every example
of judgement by taste, and even the taste of every
one. <i>Idea</i> properly means a rational concept, and
<i>Ideal</i> the representation of an individual being,
regarded as adequate to an Idea.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35" id="FNanchor_35">35</a> Hence that
archetype of taste, which certainly rests on the
indeterminate Idea that Reason has of a maximum,
but which cannot be represented by concepts, but
only in an individual presentation, is better called
the Ideal of the beautiful. Although we are not
in possession of this, we yet strive to produce
it in ourselves. But it can only be an Ideal of
the Imagination, because it rests on a presentation
and not on concepts, and the Imagination is the
faculty of presentation.—How do we arrive at such
an Ideal of beauty? <i>A priori</i>, or empirically?
Moreover, what species of the beautiful is susceptible
of an Ideal?</p>
<p>First, it is well to remark that the beauty for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
which an Ideal is to be sought cannot be <i>vague</i>
beauty, but is <i>fixed</i> by a concept of objective
purposiveness; and thus it cannot appertain to the
Object of a quite pure judgement of taste, but to
that of a judgement of taste which is in part intellectual.
That is, in whatever grounds of judgement
an Ideal is to be found, an Idea of Reason
in accordance with definite concepts must lie at
its basis; which determines <i>a priori</i> the purpose
on which the internal possibility of the object rests.
An Ideal of beautiful flowers, of a beautiful piece
of furniture, of a beautiful view, is inconceivable.
But neither can an Ideal be represented of a beauty
dependent on definite purposes, <i>e.g.</i> of a beautiful
dwelling-house, a beautiful tree, a beautiful garden,
etc.; presumably because their purpose is not
sufficiently determined and fixed by the concept,
and thus the purposiveness is nearly as free as
in the case of <i>vague</i> beauty. The only being which
has the purpose of its existence in itself is <i>man</i>, who
can determine his purposes by Reason; or, where
he must receive them from external perception, yet
can compare them with essential and universal
purposes, and can judge this their accordance
aesthetically. This <i>man</i> is, then, alone of all objects
in the world, susceptible of an Ideal of <i>beauty</i>; as
it is only <i>humanity</i> in his person, as an intelligence,
that is susceptible of the Ideal of <i>perfection</i>.</p>
<p>But there are here two elements. <i>First</i>, there
is the aesthetical <i>normal Idea</i>, which is an individual
intuition (of the Imagination), representing the
standard of our judgement [upon man] as a thing
belonging to a particular animal species. <i>Secondly</i>,
there is the <i>rational Idea</i> which makes the purposes
of humanity, so far as they cannot be sensibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
represented, the principle for judging of a figure
through which, as their phenomenal effect, those
purposes are revealed. The normal Idea of the
figure of an animal of a particular race must take
its elements from experience. But the greatest
purposiveness in the construction of the figure,
that would be available for the universal standard
of aesthetical judgement upon each individual of this
species—the image which is as it were designedly
at the basis of nature’s Technic, to which only
the whole race and not any isolated individual is
adequate—this lies merely in the Idea of the
judging [subject]. And this, with its proportions,
as an aesthetical Idea, can be completely presented
<i>in concreto</i> in a model. In order to make intelligible
in some measure (for who can extract her whole
secret from nature?) how this comes to pass, we
shall attempt a psychological explanation.</p>
<p>We must remark that, in a way quite incomprehensible
by us, the Imagination can not only recall,
on occasion, the signs for concepts long past,
but can also reproduce the image of the figure
of the object out of an unspeakable number of
objects of different kinds or even of the same kind.
Further, if the mind is concerned with comparisons,
the Imagination can, in all probability, actually
though unconsciously let one image glide into
another, and thus by the concurrence of several of
the same kind come by an average, which serves as
the common measure of all. Every one has seen
a thousand full-grown men. Now if you wish
to judge of their normal size, estimating it by means
of comparison, the Imagination (as I think) allows
a great number of images (perhaps the whole
thousand) to fall on one another. If I am allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
to apply here the analogy of optical presentation,
it is in the space where most of them are combined
and inside the contour, where the place is illuminated
with the most vivid colours, that the <i>average
size</i> is cognisable; which, both in height and
breadth, is equally far removed from the extreme
bounds of the greatest and smallest stature. And
this is the stature of a beautiful man. (We could
arrive at the same thing mechanically, by adding
together all thousand magnitudes, heights, breadths,
and thicknesses, and dividing the sum by a thousand.
But the Imagination does this by means
of a dynamical effect, which arises from the various
impressions of such figures on the organ of internal
sense.) If now in a similar way for this average
man we seek the average head, for this head
the average nose, etc., such figure is at the basis
of the normal Idea in the country where the
comparison is instituted. Thus necessarily under
these empirical conditions a negro must have a
different normal Idea of the beauty of the [human
figure] from a white man, a Chinaman a different
normal Idea from a European, etc. And the same
is the case with the model of a beautiful horse or
dog (of a certain breed).—This <i>normal Idea</i> is not
derived from proportions got from experience [and
regarded] <i>as definite rules</i>; but in accordance with
it rules for judging become in the first instance
possible. It is the image for the whole race, which
floats among all the variously different intuitions of
individuals, which nature takes as archetype in her
productions of the same species, but which seems
not to be fully reached in any individual case. It
is by no means the whole <i>archetype of beauty</i> in
the race, but only the form constituting the indispensable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
condition of all beauty, and thus merely
<i>correctness</i> in the [mental] presentation of the race.
It is, like the celebrated <i>Doryphorus</i> of <i>Polycletus</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36" id="FNanchor_36">36</a>
the <i>rule</i> (<i>Myron’s</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37" id="FNanchor_37">37</a> Cow might also be used thus for
its kind). It can therefore contain nothing specifically
characteristic, for otherwise it would not be
the <i>normal Idea</i> for the race. Its presentation
pleases, not by its beauty, but merely because it
contradicts no condition, under which alone a thing
of this kind can be beautiful. The presentation is
merely correct.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38" id="FNanchor_38">38</a></p>
<p>We must yet distinguish the <i>normal Idea</i> of the
beautiful from the <i>Ideal</i>, which latter, on grounds
already alleged, we can only expect in the <i>human</i>
figure. In this the Ideal consists in the expression
of the <i>moral</i>, without which the object would not
please universally and thus positively (not merely
negatively in a correct presentation). The visible
expression of moral Ideas that rule men inwardly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
can indeed only be got from experience; but to
make its connexion with all which our Reason
unites with the morally good in the Idea of the
highest purposiveness,—goodness of heart, purity,
strength, peace, etc.,—visible as it were in bodily
manifestation (as the effect of that which is internal),
requires a union of pure Ideas of Reason with
great imaginative power, even in him who wishes
to judge of it, still more in him who wishes to
present it. The correctness of such an Ideal of
beauty is shown by its permitting no sensible charm
to mingle with the satisfaction in the Object and yet
allowing us to take a great interest therein. This
shows that a judgement in accordance with such a
standard can never be purely aesthetical, and that a
judgement in accordance with an Ideal of beauty is
not a mere judgement of taste.</p>

<h4 id="moment_4">FOURTH MOMENT<br>
<span class="subhead">OF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE, ACCORDING TO THE
MODALITY OF THE SATISFACTION IN THE OBJECT</span></h4>
<h5 id="s18">§ 18. <i>What the modality in a judgement of
taste is</i></h5>
<p>I can say of every representation that it is at least
<i>possible</i> that (as a cognition) it should be bound
up with a pleasure. Of a representation that I
call <i>pleasant</i> I say that it <i>actually</i> excites pleasure
in me. But the <i>beautiful</i> we think as having a
<i>necessary</i> reference to satisfaction. Now this necessity
is of a peculiar kind. It is not a theoretical
objective necessity; in which case it would be
cognised <i>a priori</i> that every one <i>will feel</i> this satisfaction
in the object called beautiful by me. It is
not a practical necessity; in which case, by concepts
of a pure rational will serving as a rule for
freely acting beings, the satisfaction is the necessary
result of an objective law and only indicates that we
absolutely (without any further design) ought to
act in a certain way. But the necessity which is
thought in an aesthetical judgement can only be called
<i>exemplary</i>; <i>i.e.</i> a necessity of the assent of <i>all</i> to a
judgement which is regarded as the example of a
universal rule that we cannot state. Since an aesthetical
judgement is not an objective cognitive judgement,
this necessity cannot be derived from definite
concepts, and is therefore not apodictic. Still less
can it be inferred from the universality of experience
(of a complete agreement of judgements as to the
beauty of a certain object). For not only would
experience hardly furnish sufficiently numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
vouchers for this; but also, on empirical judgements
we can base no concept of the necessity of these
judgements.</p>
<h5 id="s19">§ 19. <i>The subjective necessity, which we ascribe
to the judgement of taste, is conditioned</i></h5>
<p>The judgement of taste requires the agreement
of every one; and he who describes anything as
beautiful claims that every one <i>ought</i> to give his
approval to the object in question and also describe
it as beautiful. The <i>ought</i> in the aesthetical judgement
is therefore pronounced in accordance with all the
data which are required for judging and yet is only
conditioned. We ask for the agreement of every
one else, because we have for it a ground that is
common to all; and we could count on this agreement,
provided we were always sure that the case
was correctly subsumed under that ground as rule
of assent.</p>
<h5 id="s20">§ 20. <i>The condition of necessity which a judgement
of taste asserts is the Idea of a common sense</i></h5>
<p>If judgements of taste (like cognitive judgements)
had a definite objective principle, then the person
who lays them down in accordance with this latter
would claim an unconditioned necessity for his judgement.
If they were devoid of all principle, like those
of the mere taste of sense, we would not allow them
in thought any necessity whatever. Hence they
must have a subjective principle which determines
what pleases or displeases only by feeling and not
by concepts, but yet with universal validity. But
such a principle could only be regarded as a <i>common
sense</i>, which is essentially different from common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Understanding which people sometimes call common
Sense (<i>sensus communis</i>); for the latter does not
judge by feeling but always by concepts, although
ordinarily only as by obscurely represented principles.</p>
<p>Hence it is only under the presupposition that
there is a common sense (by which we do not
understand an external sense, but the effect resulting
from the free play of our cognitive powers)—it is
only under this presupposition, I say, that the judgement
of taste can be laid down.</p>
<h5 id="s21">§ 21. <i>Have we ground for presupposing a common
sense?</i></h5>
<p>Cognitions and judgements must, along with the
conviction that accompanies them, admit of universal
communicability; for otherwise there would be no
harmony between them and the Object, and they
would be collectively a mere subjective play of the
representative powers, exactly as scepticism would
have it. But if cognitions are to admit of communicability,
so must also the state of mind,—<i>i.e.</i>
the accordance of the cognitive powers with a cognition
generally, and that proportion of them which
is suitable for a representation (by which an object
is given to us) in order that a cognition may be
made out of it—admit of universal communicability.
For without this as the subjective condition of
cognition, knowledge as an effect could not arise.
This actually always takes place when a given
object by means of Sense excites the Imagination
to collect the manifold, and the Imagination in its
turn excites the Understanding to bring about a
unity of this collective process in concepts. But
this accordance of the cognitive powers has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
different proportion according to the variety of the
Objects which are given. However, it must be
such that this internal relation, by which one mental
faculty is excited by another, shall be generally
the most beneficial for both faculties in respect of
cognition (of given objects); and this accordance
can only be determined by feeling (not according to
concepts). Since now this accordance itself must
admit of universal communicability, and consequently
also our feeling of it (in a given representation), and
since the universal communicability of a feeling
presupposes a common sense, we have grounds for
assuming this latter. And this common sense is
assumed without relying on psychological observations,
but simply as the necessary condition of the
universal communicability of our knowledge, which
is presupposed in every Logic and in every principle
of knowledge that is not sceptical.</p>
<h5 id="s22">§ 22. <i>The necessity of the universal agreement that
is thought in a judgement of taste is a subjective
necessity, which is represented as objective under
the presupposition of a common sense</i></h5>
<p>In all judgements by which we describe anything
as beautiful, we allow no one to be of another
opinion; without however grounding our judgement
on concepts but only on our feeling, which we therefore
place at its basis not as a private, but as a
communal feeling.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40" id="FNanchor_40">40</a> Now this common sense cannot
be grounded on experience; for it aims at justifying
judgements which contain an <i>ought</i>. It does not
say that every one <i>will</i> agree with my judgement,
but that he <i>ought</i>. And so common sense, as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
example of whose judgement I here put forward my
judgement of taste and on account of which I attribute
to the latter an <i>exemplary</i> validity, is a mere
ideal norm, under the supposition of which I have a
right to make into a rule for every one a judgement
that accords therewith, as well as the satisfaction in
an Object expressed in such judgement. For the
principle, which concerns the agreement of different
judging persons, although only subjective, is yet
assumed as subjectively universal (an Idea necessary
for every one); and thus can claim universal assent
(as if it were objective) provided we are sure
that we have correctly subsumed [the particulars]
under it.</p>
<p>This indeterminate norm of a common sense is
actually presupposed by us; as is shown by our
claim to lay down judgements of taste. Whether
there is in fact such a common sense, as a constitutive
principle of the possibility of experience, or
whether a yet higher principle of Reason makes
it only into a regulative principle for producing in
us a common sense for higher purposes: whether
therefore Taste is an original and natural faculty,
or only the Idea of an artificial one yet to be
acquired, so that a judgement of taste with its
assumption of a universal assent in fact, is only a
requirement of Reason for producing such harmony
of sentiment; whether the “ought,” <i>i.e.</i> the objective
necessity of the confluence of the feeling of any one
man with that of every other, only signifies the
possibility of arriving at this accord, and the judgement
of taste only affords an example of the application
of this principle: these questions we have
neither the wish nor the power to investigate as
yet; we have now only to resolve the faculty of taste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
into its elements in order to unite them at last in the
Idea of a common sense.</p>
<h4 id="explanation_4"> <span class="smaller">EXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM
THE FOURTH MOMENT</span></h4>
<p>The <i>beautiful</i> is that which without any concept
is cognised as the object of a <i>necessary</i> satisfaction.</p>
<h4 id="remark_1">GENERAL REMARK ON THE FIRST SECTION OF THE ANALYTIC</h4>
<p>If we seek the result of the preceding analysis
we find that everything runs up into this concept of
Taste, that it is a faculty for judging an object in
reference to the Imagination’s <i>free conformity to law</i>.
Now if in the judgement of taste the Imagination must
be considered in its freedom, it is in the first place
not regarded as reproductive, as it is subject to the
laws of association, but as productive and spontaneous
(as the author of arbitrary forms of possible intuition).
And although in the apprehension of a
given object of sense it is tied to a definite form of
this Object, and so far has no free play (such as that
of poetry) yet it may readily be conceived that the
object can furnish it with such a form containing a
collection of the manifold, as the Imagination itself,
if it were left free, would project in accordance with
the <i>conformity to law of the Understanding</i> in
general. But that the <i>imaginative power</i> should be
<i>free</i> and yet <i>of itself conformed to law</i>, <i>i.e.</i> bringing
autonomy with it, is a contradiction. The Understanding
alone gives the law. If, however, the
Imagination is compelled to proceed according to a
definite law, its product in respect of form is determined
by concepts as to what it ought to be. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
then, as is above shown, the satisfaction is not that
in the Beautiful, but in the Good (in perfection, at
any rate in mere formal perfection); and the judgement
is not a judgement of taste. Hence it is a
conformity to law without a law; and a subjective
agreement of the Imagination and Understanding,—without
such an objective agreement as there is
when the representation is referred to a definite
concept of an object,—can subsist along with the free
conformity to law of the Understanding (which is
also called purposiveness without purpose) and with
the peculiar feature of a judgement of taste.</p>
<p>Now geometrically regular figures, such as a
circle, a square, a cube, etc., are commonly adduced
by critics of taste as the simplest and most indisputable
examples of beauty; and yet they are called
regular, because we can only represent them by
regarding them as mere presentations of a definite
concept which prescribes the rule for the figure
(according to which alone it is possible). One of
these two must be wrong, either that judgement of
the critic which ascribes beauty to the said figures,
or ours, which regards purposiveness apart from a
concept as requisite for beauty.</p>
<p>Hardly any one will say that a man must have taste
in order that he should find more satisfaction in a
circle than in a scrawled outline, in an equilateral and
equiangular quadrilateral than in one which is oblique,
irregular, and as it were deformed, for this belongs to
the ordinary Understanding and is not Taste at all.
Where, <i>e.g.</i> our design is to judge of the size of an
area, or to make intelligible the relation of the parts
of it, when divided, to one another and to the whole,
then regular figures and those of the simplest kind are
needed, and the satisfaction does not rest immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
on the aspect of the figure, but on its availability for
all kinds of possible designs. A room whose walls
form oblique angles, or a parterre of this kind, even
every violation of symmetry in the figure of animals
(<i>e.g.</i> being one-eyed), of buildings, or of flower beds,
displeases, because it contradicts the purpose of the
thing, not only practically in respect of a definite
use of it, but also when we pass judgement on it as
regards any possible design. This is not the case
in the judgement of taste, which when pure combines
satisfaction or dissatisfaction,—without any
reference to its use or to a purpose,—with the mere
<i>consideration</i> of the object.</p>
<p>The regularity which leads to the concept of an
object is indeed the indispensable condition (<i>conditio
sine qua non</i>) for grasping the object in a single
representation and determining the manifold in its
form. This determination is a purpose in respect of
cognition, and in reference to this it is always bound
up with satisfaction (which accompanies the execution
of every, even problematical, design). There is
here, however, merely the approval of the solution
satisfying a problem, and not a free and indefinite
purposive entertainment of the mental powers with
what we call beautiful, where the Understanding is
at the service of Imagination and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>In a thing that is only possible by means of design,—a
building, or even an animal,—the regularity
consisting in symmetry must express the unity
of the intuition that accompanies the concept of
purpose, and this regularity belongs to cognition.
But where only a free play of the representative
powers (under the condition, however, that the
Understanding is to suffer no shock thereby) is to
be kept up, in pleasure gardens, room decorations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
all kinds of tasteful furniture, etc., regularity that
shows constraint is avoided as much as possible.
Thus in the English taste in gardens, or in bizarre
taste in furniture, the freedom of the Imagination is
pushed almost near to the grotesque, and in this
separation from every constraint of rule we have the
case, where taste can display its greatest perfection
in the enterprises of the Imagination.</p>
<p>All stiff regularity (such as approximates to
mathematical regularity) has something in it repugnant
to taste; for our entertainment in the
contemplation of it lasts for no length of time,
but it rather, in so far as it has not expressly in
view cognition or a definite practical purpose, produces
weariness. On the other hand that with
which Imagination can play in an unstudied and
purposive manner is always new to us, and one
does not get tired of looking at it. <i>Marsden</i> in
his description of Sumatra makes the remark that
the free beauties of nature surround the spectator
everywhere and thus lose their attraction for him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41" id="FNanchor_41">41</a>
On the other hand a pepper-garden, where the stakes
on which this plant twines itself form parallel rows,
had much attractiveness for him, if he met with it
in the middle of a forest. And hence he infers that
wild beauty, apparently irregular, only pleases as a
variation from the regular beauty of which one has
seen enough. But he need only have made the
experiment of spending one day in a pepper-garden,
to have been convinced that, once the Understanding,
by the aid of this regularity, has put itself in accord
with the order that it always needs, the object will
not entertain for long,—nay rather it will impose a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
burdensome constraint upon the Imagination. On
the other hand, nature, which there is prodigal in its
variety even to luxuriance, that is subjected to no
constraint of artificial rules, can supply constant food
for taste.—Even the song of birds, which we can
bring under no musical rule, seems to have more
freedom, and therefore more for taste, than a song of
a human being which is produced in accordance with
all the rules of music; for we very much sooner weary
of the latter, if it is repeated often and at length.
Here, however, we probably confuse our participation
in the mirth of a little creature that we love,
with the beauty of its song; for if this were exactly
imitated by man (as sometimes the notes of the
nightingale are)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42" id="FNanchor_42">42</a> it would seem to our ear quite
devoid of taste.</p>
<p>Again, beautiful objects are to be distinguished
from beautiful views of objects (which often on
account of their distance cannot be clearly recognised).
In the latter case taste appears not
so much in what the Imagination <i>apprehends</i> in
this field, as in the impulse it thus gets to <i>fiction</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> in the peculiar fancies with which the mind
entertains itself, whilst it is continually being aroused
by the variety which strikes the eye. An illustration
is afforded, <i>e.g.</i> by the sight of the changing
shapes of a fire on the hearth or of a rippling brook;
neither of these has beauty, but they bring with
them a charm for the Imagination, because they
entertain it in free play.</p>

<h2 id="book_2"> <span class="larger">SECOND BOOK<br>
<span class="subhead">ANALYTIC OF THE SUBLIME</span></span></h2>
<h5 id="s23">§ 23. <i>Transition from the faculty which judges of
the Beautiful to that which judges of the Sublime</i></h5>
<p>The Beautiful and the Sublime agree in this,
that both please in themselves. Further, neither
presupposes a judgement of sense nor a judgement
logically determined, but a judgement of reflection.
Consequently the satisfaction [belonging to them]
does not depend on a sensation, as in the case of
the Pleasant, nor on a definite concept, as in the
case of the Good; but it is nevertheless referred to
concepts although indeterminate ones. And so the
satisfaction is connected with the mere presentation
[of the object] or with the faculty of presentation;
so that in the case of a given intuition this faculty
or the Imagination is considered as in agreement
with the <i>faculty of concepts</i> of Understanding or
Reason (in its furtherance of these latter). Hence
both kinds of judgements are <i>singular</i>, and yet
announce themselves as universally valid for every
subject; although they lay claim merely to the
feeling of pleasure and not to any knowledge of the
object.</p>
<p>But there are also remarkable differences between
the two. The Beautiful in nature is connected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
with the form of the object, which consists in having
boundaries. The Sublime, on the other hand, is to
be found in a formless object, so far as in it or by
occasion of it <i>boundlessness</i> is represented, and yet
its totality is also present to thought. Thus the
Beautiful seems to be regarded as the presentation
of an indefinite concept of Understanding;
the Sublime as that of a like concept of Reason.
Therefore the satisfaction in the one case is bound
up with the representation of <i>quality</i>, in the other
with that of <i>quantity</i>. And the latter satisfaction
is quite different in kind from the former, for this
[the Beautiful<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43" id="FNanchor_43">43</a>] directly brings with it a feeling of
the furtherance of life, and thus is compatible with
charms and with the play of the Imagination. But
the other [the feeling of the Sublime<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43">43</a>] is a pleasure
that arises only indirectly; viz. it is produced by
the feeling of a momentary checking of the vital
powers and a consequent stronger outflow of them,
so that it seems to be regarded as emotion,—not
play, but earnest in the exercise of the Imagination.—Hence
it is incompatible with charms; and as
the mind is not merely attracted by the object but
is ever being alternately repelled, the satisfaction
in the sublime does not so much involve a positive
pleasure as admiration or respect, which rather
deserves to be called negative pleasure.</p>
<p>But the inner and most important distinction
between the Sublime and Beautiful is, certainly,
as follows. (Here, as we are entitled to do, we only
bring under consideration in the first instance the
sublime in natural Objects; for the sublime of Art
is always limited by the conditions of agreement
with Nature.) Natural beauty (which is self-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>subsisting)
brings with it a purposiveness in its
form by which the object seems to be, as it were,
pre-adapted to our Judgement, and thus constitutes
in itself an object of satisfaction. On the other
hand, that which excites in us, without any reasoning
about it, but in the mere apprehension of it,
the feeling of the sublime, may appear as regards
its form to violate purpose in respect of the Judgement,
to be unsuited to our presentative faculty,
and, as it were, to do violence to the Imagination;
and yet it is judged to be only the more sublime.</p>
<p>Now from this we may see that in general we
express ourselves incorrectly if we call any <i>object of
nature</i> sublime, although we can quite correctly call
many objects of nature beautiful. For how can
that be marked by an expression of approval, which
is apprehended in itself as being a violation of
purpose? All that we can say is that the object
is fit for the presentation of a sublimity which can
be found in the mind; for no sensible form can
contain the sublime properly so-called. This concerns
only Ideas of the Reason, which, although no
adequate presentation is possible for them, by this
inadequacy that admits of sensible presentation, are
aroused and summoned into the mind. Thus the
wide ocean, agitated by the storm, cannot be called
sublime. Its aspect is horrible; and the mind must
be already filled with manifold Ideas if it is to be
determined by such an intuition to a feeling itself
sublime, as it is incited to abandon sensibility and
to busy itself with Ideas that involve higher purposiveness.</p>
<p>Self-subsisting natural beauty discovers to us a
Technic of nature, which represents it as a system
in accordance with laws, the principle of which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
do not find in the whole of our faculty of Understanding.
That principle is the principle of purposiveness,
in respect of the use of our Judgement
in regard to phenomena; [which requires] that
these must not be judged as merely belonging
to nature in its purposeless mechanism, but also
as belonging to something analogous to art. It,
therefore, actually extends, not indeed our cognition
of natural Objects, but our concept of nature; [which
is now not regarded] as mere mechanism but as
art. This leads to profound investigations as to
the possibility of such a form. But in what we
are accustomed to call sublime there is nothing
at all that leads to particular objective principles
and forms of nature corresponding to them; so far
from it that for the most part nature excites the Ideas
of the sublime in its chaos or in its wildest and most
irregular disorder and desolation, provided size and
might are perceived. Hence, we see that the
concept of the Sublime is not nearly so important
or rich in consequences as the concept of the
Beautiful; and that in general it displays nothing
purposive in nature itself, but only in that possible
use of our intuitions of it by which there is produced
in us a feeling of a purposiveness quite independent
of nature. We must seek a ground external to
ourselves for the Beautiful of nature; but seek it
for the Sublime merely in ourselves and in our
attitude of thought which introduces sublimity into
the representation of nature. This is a very needful
preliminary remark, which quite separates the
Ideas of the sublime from that of a purposiveness
of <i>nature</i>, and makes the theory of the sublime
a mere appendix to the aesthetical judging of that
purposiveness; because by means of it no particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
form is represented in nature, but there is only
developed a purposive use which the Imagination
makes of its representation.</p>
<h5 id="s24">§ 24. <i>Of the divisions of an investigation into the
feeling of the sublime</i></h5>
<p>As regards the division of the moments of the
aesthetical judging of objects in reference to the
feeling of the sublime, the Analytic can proceed
according to the same principle as was adapted in
the analysis of judgements of taste. For as an act
of the aesthetical reflective Judgement, the satisfaction
in the Sublime must be represented just as in
the case of the Beautiful,—according to <i>quantity</i> as
universally valid, according to <i>quality</i> as devoid of
<i>interest</i>, according to <i>relation</i> as subjective purposiveness,
and according to <i>modality</i> as necessary.
And so the method here will not diverge from that
of the preceding section; unless, indeed, we count
it a difference that in the case where the aesthetical
Judgement is concerned with the form of the Object
we began with the investigation of its quality, but
here, in view of the formlessness which may belong
to what we call sublime, we shall begin with quantity,
as the first moment of the aesthetical judgement as
to the sublime. The reason for this may be seen
from the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>But the analysis of the Sublime involves a
division not needed in the case of the Beautiful,
viz. a division into the <i>mathematically</i> and the
<i>dynamically sublime</i>.</p>
<p>For the feeling of the Sublime brings with it as
its characteristic feature a <i>movement</i> of the mind
bound up with the judging of the object, while in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the case of the Beautiful taste presupposes and
maintains the mind in <i>restful</i> contemplation. Now
this movement ought to be judged as subjectively
purposive (because the sublime pleases us), and
thus it is referred through the Imagination either to
the <i>faculty of cognition</i> or of <i>desire</i>. In either
reference the purposiveness of the given representation
ought to be judged only in respect of this
<i>faculty</i> (without purpose or interest); but in the
first case it is ascribed to the Object as a <i>mathematical</i>
determination of the Imagination, in the
second as <i>dynamical</i>. And hence we have this
twofold way of representing the sublime.</p>
<h4 id="A">A.—<span class="smcap">Of the Mathematically Sublime</span></h4>
<h5 id="s25">§ 25. <i>Explanation of the term “sublime”</i></h5>
<p>We call that <i>sublime</i> which is <i>absolutely great</i>.
But to be great, and to be a great something are
quite different concepts (<i>magnitudo</i> and <i>quantitas</i>).
In like manner to <i>say simply</i> (<i>simpliciter</i>) that
anything is <i>great</i> is quite different from saying that
it is <i>absolutely great</i> (<i>absolute, non comparative
magnum</i>). The latter is <i>what is great beyond all
comparison</i>.—What now is meant by the expression
that anything is great or small or of medium
size? It is not a pure concept of Understanding
that is thus signified; still less is it an intuition of
Sense, and just as little is it a concept of Reason,
because it brings with it no principle of cognition.
It must therefore be a concept of Judgement or
derived from one; and a subjective purposiveness
of the representation in reference to the Judgement
must lie at its basis. That anything is a magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
(<i>quantum</i>) may be cognised from the thing itself,
without any comparison of it with other things; viz.
if there is a multiplicity of the homogeneous constituting
one thing. But to cognise <i>how great</i> it
is always requires some other magnitude as a
measure. But because the judging of magnitude
depends not merely on multiplicity (number), but
also on the magnitude of the unit (the measure),
and since, to judge of the magnitude of this latter
again requires another as measure with which it
may be compared, we see that the determination
of the magnitude of phenomena can supply no
absolute concept whatever of magnitude, but only
a comparative one.</p>
<p>If now I say simply that anything is great, it
appears that I have no comparison in view, at least
none with an objective measure; because it is thus
not determined at all how great the object is. But
although the standard of comparison is merely
subjective, yet the judgement none the less claims
universal assent; “this man is beautiful,” and “he
is tall,” are judgements not limited merely to the
judging subject, but, like theoretical judgements,
demanding the assent of every one.</p>
<p>In a judgement by which anything is designated
simply as great, it is not merely meant that the
object has a magnitude, but that this magnitude is
superior to that of many other objects of the same
kind, without, however, any exact determination of
this superiority. Thus there is always at the basis
of our judgement a standard which we assume as
the same for every one; this, however, is not available
for any logical (mathematically definite) judging
of magnitude, but only for aesthetical judging of the
same, because it is a merely subjective standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
lying at the basis of the reflective judgement upon
magnitude. It may be empirical, as, <i>e.g.</i> the
average size of the men known to us, of animals of
a certain kind, trees, houses, mountains, etc. Or it
may be a standard given <i>a priori</i>, which through
the defects of the judging subject is limited by the
subjective conditions of presentation <i>in concreto</i>; as,
<i>e.g.</i> in the practical sphere, the greatness of a
certain virtue, or of the public liberty and justice in
a country; or, in the theoretical sphere, the greatness
of the accuracy or the inaccuracy of an observation
or measurement that has been made, etc.</p>
<p>Here it is remarkable that, although we have no
interest whatever in an Object,—<i>i.e.</i> its existence is
indifferent to us,—yet its mere size, even if it is
considered as formless, may bring a satisfaction with
it that is universally communicable, and that consequently
involves the consciousness of a subjective
purposiveness in the use of our cognitive faculty.
This is not indeed a satisfaction in the Object
(because it may be formless), as in the case of the
Beautiful, in which the reflective Judgement finds
itself purposively determined in reference to cognition
in general; but [a satisfaction] in the extension
of the Imagination by itself.</p>
<p>If (under the above limitation) we say simply of
an object “it is great,” this is no mathematically
definite judgement but a mere judgement of reflection
upon the representation of it, which is subjectively
purposive for a certain use of our cognitive
powers in the estimation of magnitude; and we
always then bind up with the representation a kind
of respect, as also a kind of contempt for what we
simply call “small.” Further, the judging of things
as great or small extends to everything, even to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
their characteristics; thus we describe beauty as
great or small. The reason of this is to be sought
in the fact that whatever we present in intuition
according to the precept of the Judgement (and thus
represent aesthetically) is always a phenomenon and
thus a quantum.</p>
<p>But if we call anything not only great, but absolutely
great in every point of view (great beyond all
comparison), <i>i.e.</i> sublime, we soon see that it is not
permissible to seek for an adequate standard of this
outside itself, but merely in itself. It is a magnitude
which is like itself alone. It follows hence
that the sublime is not to be sought in the things of
nature, but only in our Ideas; but in which of them
it lies must be reserved for the Deduction.</p>
<p>The foregoing explanation can be thus expressed:
<i>the sublime is that in comparison with which everything
else is small</i>. Here we easily see that nothing
can be given in nature, however great it is judged
by us to be, which could not if considered in another
relation be reduced to the infinitely small; and conversely
there is nothing so small, which does not
admit of extension by our Imagination to the greatness
of a world, if compared with still smaller
standards. Telescopes have furnished us with
abundant material for making the first remark,
microscopes for the second. Nothing, therefore,
which can be an object of the senses, is, considered
on this basis, to be called sublime. But because there
is in our Imagination a striving towards infinite
progress, and in our Reason a claim for absolute
totality, regarded as a real Idea, therefore this very
inadequateness for that Idea in our faculty for
estimating the magnitude of things of sense, excites
in us the feeling of a supersensible faculty. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
it is not the object of sense, but the use which the
Judgement naturally makes of certain objects on
behalf of this latter feeling, that is absolutely great;
and in comparison every other use is small. Consequently
it is the state of mind produced by a certain
representation with which the reflective Judgement
is occupied, and not the Object, that is to be called
sublime.</p>
<p>We may therefore append to the preceding
formulas explaining the sublime this other: <i>the sublime
is that, the mere ability to think which, shows a
faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense</i>.</p>
<h5 id="s26">§ 26. <i>Of that estimation of the magnitude of natural
things which is requisite for the Idea of the Sublime</i></h5>
<p>The estimation of magnitude by means of concepts
of number (or their signs in Algebra) is
mathematical; but that in mere intuition (by the
measurement of the eye) is aesthetical. Now we
can come by definite concepts of <i>how great</i> a thing is,
[only]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44" id="FNanchor_44">44</a> by numbers, of which the unit is the measure
(at all events by series of numbers progressing to
infinity); and so far all logical estimation of magnitude
is mathematical. But since the magnitude of
the measure must then be assumed known, and this
again is only to be estimated mathematically by
means of numbers,—the unit of which must be another
[smaller] measure,—we can never have a first
or fundamental measure, and therefore can never
have a definite concept of a given magnitude. So
the estimation of the magnitude of the fundamental
measure must consist in this, that we can immediately
apprehend it in intuition and use it by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Imagination for the presentation of concepts of
number. That is, all estimation of the magnitude
of the objects of nature is in the end aesthetical (<i>i.e.</i>
subjectively and not objectively determined).</p>
<p>Now for the mathematical estimation of magnitude
there is, indeed, no maximum (for the power of
numbers extends to infinity); but for its aesthetical
estimation there is always a maximum, and of
this I say that if it is judged as the absolute measure
than which no greater is possible subjectively (for
the judging subject), it brings with it the Idea of the
sublime and produces that emotion which no mathematical
estimation of its magnitude by means of
numbers can bring about (except so far as the
aesthetical fundamental measure remains vividly in
the Imagination). For the former only presents
relative magnitude by means of comparison with
others of the same kind; but the latter presents
magnitude absolutely, so far as the mind can grasp
it in an intuition.</p>
<p>In receiving a quantum into the Imagination by
intuition, in order to be able to use it for a measure
or as a unit for the estimation of magnitude by means
of numbers, there are two operations of the Imagination
involved: <i>apprehension</i> (<i>apprehensio</i>) and <i>comprehension</i>
(<i>comprehensio aesthetica</i>). As to apprehension
there is no difficulty, for it can go on <i>ad
infinitum</i>; but comprehension becomes harder the
further apprehension advances, and soon attains to
its maximum, viz. the aesthetically greatest fundamental
measure for the estimation of magnitude.
For when apprehension has gone so far that the
partial representations of sensuous intuition at first
apprehended begin to vanish in the Imagination,
whilst this ever proceeds to the apprehension of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
others, then it loses as much on the one side as it
gains on the other; and in comprehension there is a
maximum beyond which it cannot go.</p>
<p>Hence can be explained what <i>Savary</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45" id="FNanchor_45">45</a> remarks in
his account of Egypt, viz. that we must keep from
going very near the Pyramids just as much as we
keep from going too far from them, in order to get
the full emotional effect from their size. For if we
are too far away, the parts to be apprehended
(the stones lying one over the other) are only
obscurely represented, and the representation of
them produces no effect upon the aesthetical judgement
of the subject. But if we are very near, the
eye requires some time to complete the apprehension
of the tiers from the bottom up to the apex; and
then the first tiers are always partly forgotten before
the Imagination has taken in the last, and so the
comprehension of them is never complete.—The
same thing may sufficiently explain the bewilderment
or, as it were, perplexity which, it is said, seizes the
spectator on his first entrance into St. Peter’s at
Rome. For there is here a feeling of the inadequacy
of his Imagination for presenting the Ideas of a
whole, wherein the Imagination reaches its maximum,
and, in striving to surpass it, sinks back into
itself, by which, however, a kind of emotional satisfaction
is produced.</p>
<p>I do not wish to speak as yet of the ground of
this satisfaction, which is bound up with a representation
from which we should least of all expect it,
viz. a representation which lets us remark its
inadequacy and consequently its subjective want of
purposiveness for the Judgement in the estimation of
magnitude. I only remark that if the aesthetical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
judgement is pure (i.e. <i>mingled with no teleological
judgement</i> or judgement of Reason) and is to be given
as a completely suitable example of the Critique of
the <i>aesthetical</i> Judgement, we must not exhibit the
sublime in products of art (<i>e.g.</i> buildings, pillars, etc.)
where human purpose determines the form as well
as the size; nor yet in things of nature <i>the concepts
of which bring with them a definite purpose</i> (<i>e.g.</i>
animals with a known natural destination); but in
rude nature (and in this only in so far as it does not
bring with it any charm or emotion produced by
actual danger) merely as containing magnitude.
For in this kind of representation nature contains
nothing monstrous (either magnificent or horrible);
the magnitude that is apprehended may be increased
as much as you wish provided it can be comprehended
in a whole by the Imagination. An object
is <i>monstrous</i> if by its size it destroys the purpose
which constitutes the concept of it. But the mere
presentation of a concept is called <i>colossal</i>, which is
almost too great for any presentation (bordering on
the relatively monstrous); because the purpose of
the presentation of a concept is made harder [to
realise] by the intuition of the object being almost
too great for our faculty of apprehension.—A pure
judgement upon the sublime must, however, have no
purpose of the Object as its determining ground, if
it is to be aesthetical and not mixed up with any
judgement of Understanding or Reason.</p>
<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p>Because everything which is to give disinterested
pleasure to the merely reflective Judgement must
bring with the representation of it, subjective and,
as subjective, universally valid purposiveness—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>although
no purposiveness of the <i>form</i> of the object
lies (as in the case of the Beautiful) at the ground of
the judgement—the question arises “what is this
subjective purposiveness?” And how does it come
to be prescribed as the norm by which a ground for
universally valid satisfaction is supplied in the mere
estimation of magnitude, even in that which is
forced up to the point where our faculty of Imagination
is inadequate for the presentation of the concept
of magnitude?</p>
<p>In the process of combination requisite for the
estimation of magnitude, the Imagination proceeds
of itself to infinity without anything hindering it;
but the Understanding guides it by means of concepts
of number, for which the Imagination must furnish
the schema. And in this procedure, as belonging to
the logical estimation of magnitude, there is indeed
something objectively purposive,—in accordance
with the concept of a purpose (as all measurement
is),—but nothing purposive and pleasing for the
aesthetical Judgement. There is also in this
designed purposiveness nothing which would force
us to push the magnitude of the measure, and consequently
the <i>comprehension</i> of the manifold in an
intuition, to the bounds of the faculty of Imagination,
or as far as ever this can reach in its presentations.
For in the estimation of magnitude by the Understanding
(Arithmetic) we only go to a certain point
whether we push the comprehension of the units up
to the number 10 (as in the decimal scale) or only
up to 4 (as in the quaternary scale); the further
production of magnitude proceeds by combination
or, if the quantum is given in intuition, by apprehension,
but merely by way of progression (not of
comprehension) in accordance with an assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
principle of progression. In this mathematical
estimation of magnitude the Understanding is equally
served and contented whether the Imagination
chooses for unit a magnitude that we can take in in
a glance, <i>e.g.</i> a foot or rod, or a German mile or
even the earth’s diameter,—of which the apprehension
is indeed possible, but not the comprehension
in an intuition of the Imagination (not possible by
<i>comprehensio aesthetica</i>, although quite possible by
<i>comprehensio logica</i> in a concept of number). In both
cases the logical estimation of magnitude goes on
without hindrance to infinity.</p>
<p>But now the mind listens to the voice of Reason
which, for every given magnitude,—even for those
that can never be entirely apprehended, although (in
sensible representation) they are judged as entirely
given,—requires totality. Reason consequently
desires comprehension in <i>one</i> intuition, and so the
<i>presentation</i> of all these members of a progressively
increasing series. It does not even exempt the
infinite (space and past time) from this requirement;
it rather renders it unavoidable to think the infinite
(in the judgement of common Reason) as <i>entirely
given</i> (according to its totality).</p>
<p>But the infinite is absolutely (not merely comparatively)
great. Compared with it everything
else (of the same kind of magnitudes) is small. And
what is most important is that to be able only to
think it as <i>a whole</i> indicates a faculty of mind which
surpasses every standard of Sense. For [to represent
it sensibly] would require a comprehension
having for unit a standard bearing a definite relation,
expressible in numbers, to the infinite; which is
impossible. Nevertheless, <i>the bare capability of
thinking</i> this infinite without contradiction requires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
in the human mind a faculty itself supersensible. For
it is only by means of this faculty and its Idea of a
noumenon,—which admits of no intuition, but
which yet serves as the substrate for the intuition
of the world, as a mere phenomenon,—that the
infinite of the world of sense, in the pure intellectual
estimation of magnitude, can be <i>completely</i> comprehended
<i>under</i> a concept, although in the mathematical
estimation of magnitude by means of <i>concepts
of number</i> it can never be completely thought. The
faculty of being able to think the infinite of supersensible
intuition as given (in its intelligible substrate),
surpasses every standard of sensibility, and
is great beyond all comparison even with the faculty
of mathematical estimation; not of course in a
theoretical point of view and on behalf of the
cognitive faculty, but as an extension of the mind
which feels itself able in another (practical) point of
view to go beyond the limit of sensibility.</p>
<p>Nature is therefore sublime in those of its
phenomena, whose intuition brings with it the Idea
of their infinity. This last can only come by the inadequacy
of the greatest effort of our Imagination to
estimate the magnitude of an object. But now in
mathematical estimation of magnitude the Imagination
is equal to providing a sufficient measure for
every object; because the numerical concepts of the
Understanding, by means of progression, can make
any measure adequate to any given magnitude.
Therefore it must be the <i>aesthetical</i> estimation
of magnitude in which it is felt that the effort
towards comprehension surpasses the power of
the Imagination to grasp in a whole of intuition
the progressive apprehension; and at the same
time is perceived the inadequacy of this faculty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
unbounded in its progress, for grasping and using,
for the estimation of magnitude, a fundamental
measure which could be made available by the
Understanding with little trouble. Now the proper
unchangeable fundamental measure of nature is its
absolute whole; which, regarding nature as a
phenomenon, would be infinity comprehended. But
since this fundamental measure is a self-contradictory
concept (on account of the impossibility of the
absolute totality of an endless progress), that magnitude
of a natural Object, on which the Imagination
fruitlessly spends its whole faculty of comprehension,
must carry our concept of nature to a supersensible
substrate (which lies at its basis and also at the basis
of our faculty of thought). As this, however, is
great beyond all standards of sense, it makes us judge
as <i>sublime</i>, not so much the object, as our own state
of mind in the estimation of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, just as the aesthetical Judgement in
judging the Beautiful refers the Imagination in its
free play to the <i>Understanding</i>, in order to harmonise
it with the <i>concepts</i> of the latter in general (without
any determination of them); so does the same
faculty when judging a thing as Sublime refer itself
to the <i>Reason</i> in order that it may subjectively be
in accordance with its <i>Ideas</i> (no matter what they
are):—<i>i.e.</i> that it may produce a state of mind
conformable to them and compatible with that
brought about by the influence of definite (practical)
Ideas upon feeling.</p>
<p>We hence see also that true sublimity must be
sought only in the mind of the [subject] judging,
not in the natural Object, the judgement upon which
occasions this state. Who would call sublime, <i>e.g.</i>
shapeless mountain masses piled in wild disorder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
upon each other with their pyramids of ice, or the
gloomy raging sea? But the mind feels itself
elevated in its own judgement if, while contemplating
them without any reference to their form, and
abandoning itself to the Imagination and to the
Reason—which although placed in combination with
the Imagination without any definite purpose,
merely extends it—it yet finds the whole power of
the Imagination inadequate to its Ideas.</p>
<p>Examples of the mathematically Sublime of
nature in mere intuition are all the cases in which
we are given, not so much a larger numerical
concept as a large unit for the measure of the
Imagination (for shortening the numerical series).
A tree, [the height of] which we estimate with
reference to the height of a man, at all events gives
a standard for a mountain; and if this were a mile
high, it would serve as unit for the number expressive
of the earth’s diameter, so that the latter
might be made intuitible. The earth’s diameter
[would supply a unit] for the known planetary
system; this again for the Milky Way; and the
immeasurable number of milky way systems called
nebulae,—which presumably constitute a system of
the same kind among themselves—lets us expect
no bounds here. Now the Sublime in the aesthetical
judging of an immeasurable whole like this lies
not so much in the greatness of the number [of
units], as in the fact that in our progress we ever
arrive at yet greater units. To this the systematic
division of the universe contributes, which represents
every magnitude in nature as small in its turn; and
represents our Imagination with its entire freedom
from bounds, and with it Nature, as a mere nothing
in comparison with the Ideas of Reason, if it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
sought to furnish a presentation which shall be
adequate to them.</p>
<h5 id="s27">§ 27. <i>Of the quality of the satisfaction in our
judgements upon the Sublime</i></h5>
<p>The feeling of our incapacity to attain to an
Idea, <i>which is a law for us</i>, is <span class="smcap smaller">RESPECT</span>. Now the
Idea of the comprehension of every phenomenon
that can be given us in the intuition of a whole, is
an Idea prescribed to us by a law of Reason, which
recognises no other measure, definite, valid for
every one, and invariable, than the absolute whole.
But our Imagination, even in its greatest efforts, in
respect of that comprehension, which we expect
from it, of a given object in a whole of intuition
(and thus with reference to the presentation of the
Idea of Reason), exhibits its own limits and inadequacy;
although at the same time it shows that
its destination is to make itself adequate to this
Idea regarded as a law. Therefore the feeling of the
Sublime in nature is respect for our own destination,
which by a certain subreption we attribute to
an Object of nature (conversion of respect for the
Idea of humanity in our own subject into respect
for the Object). This makes intuitively evident
the superiority of the rational determination of our
cognitive faculties to the greatest faculty of our
Sensibility.</p>
<p>The feeling of the Sublime is therefore a feeling
of pain, arising from the want of accordance between
the aesthetical estimation of magnitude formed
by the Imagination and the estimation of the same
formed by Reason. There is at the same time a
pleasure thus excited, arising from the correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
with rational Ideas of this very judgement
of the inadequacy of our greatest faculty of Sense;
in so far as it is a law for us to strive after these
Ideas. In fact it is for us a law (of Reason), and
belongs to our destination, to estimate as small, in
comparison with Ideas of Reason, everything which
nature, regarded as an object of Sense, contains
that is great for us; and that which arouses in us
the feeling of this supersensible destination agrees
with that law. Now the greatest effort of the
Imagination in the presentation of the unit for the
estimation of magnitude indicates a reference to
something <i>absolutely great</i>; and consequently a
reference to the law of Reason, which bids us take
this alone as the supreme measure of magnitude.
Therefore the inner perception of the inadequacy
of all sensible standards for rational estimation of
magnitude indicates a correspondence with rational
laws; it involves a pain, which arouses in us the
feeling of our supersensible destination, according
to which it is purposive and therefore pleasurable
to find every standard of Sensibility inadequate to
the Ideas of Understanding.</p>
<p>The mind feels itself <i>moved</i> in the representation
of the Sublime in nature; whilst in aesthetical
judgements about the Beautiful it is in <i>restful</i>
contemplation. This movement may (especially in
its beginnings) be compared to a vibration, <i>i.e.</i> to a
quickly alternating attraction towards, and repulsion
from, the same Object. The transcendent (towards
which the Imagination is impelled in its apprehension
of intuition) is for the Imagination like an abyss in
which it fears to lose itself; but for the rational
Idea of the supersensible it is not transcendent but
in conformity with law to bring about such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
effort of the Imagination, and consequently here
there is the same amount of attraction as there was
of repulsion for the mere Sensibility. But the
judgement itself always remains in this case only
aesthetical, because—without having any determinate
concept of the Object at its basis—it merely
represents the subjective play of the mental powers
(Imagination and Reason) as harmonious through
their very contrast. For just as Imagination and
<i>Understanding</i>, in judging of the Beautiful, generate
a subjective purposiveness of the mental powers
by means of their harmony, so [here<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46" id="FNanchor_46">46</a>] Imagination
and <i>Reason</i> do so by means of their conflict. That
is, they bring about a feeling that we possess pure
self-subsistent Reason, or a faculty for the estimation
of magnitude, whose pre-eminence can be made
intuitively evident only by the inadequacy of that
faculty [Imagination] which is itself unbounded in
the presentation of magnitudes (of sensible objects).</p>
<p>The measurement of a space (regarded as
apprehension) is at the same time a description of it,
and thus an objective movement in the act of Imagination
and a progress. On the other hand, the comprehension
of the manifold in the unity,—not of thought
but of intuition,—and consequently the comprehension
of the successively apprehended [elements] in one
glance, is a regress, which annihilates the condition of
time in this progress of the Imagination and makes
<i>coexistence</i> intuitible.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47" id="FNanchor_47">47</a> It is therefore (since the
time-series is a condition of the internal sense and
of an intuition) a subjective movement of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Imagination, by which it does violence to the
internal sense; this must be the more noticeable,
the greater the quantum is which the Imagination
comprehends in one intuition. The effort, therefore,
to receive in one single intuition a measure for
magnitudes that requires an appreciable time to
apprehend, is a kind of representation, which, subjectively
considered, is contrary to purpose: but
objectively, as requisite for the estimation of magnitude,
it is purposive. Thus that very violence
which is done to the subject through the Imagination
is judged as purposive <i>in reference to the whole
determination</i> of the mind.</p>
<p>The <i>quality</i> of the feeling of the Sublime is that
it is a feeling of pain in reference to the faculty by
which we judge aesthetically of an object, which pain,
however, is represented at the same time as purposive.
This is possible through the fact that the very incapacity
in question discovers the consciousness of
an unlimited faculty of the same subject, and that
the mind can only judge of the latter aesthetically
by means of the former.</p>
<p>In the logical estimation of magnitude the
impossibility of ever arriving at absolute totality,
by means of the progress of the measurement of
things of the sensible world in time and space, was
cognised as objective, <i>i.e.</i> as an impossibility of
<i>thinking</i> the infinite as entirely given; and not as
merely subjective or that there was only an incapacity
to <i>grasp</i> it. For there we have not to
do with the degree of comprehension in an intuition,
regarded as a measure, but everything depends on a
concept of number. But in aesthetical estimation of
magnitude the concept of number must disappear or
be changed, and the comprehension of the Imagination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
in reference to the unit of measure (thus avoiding the
concepts of a law of the successive production of
concepts of magnitude) is alone purposive for it.—If
now a magnitude almost reaches the limit of our
faculty of comprehension in an intuition, and yet
the Imagination is invited by means of numerical
magnitudes (in respect of which we are conscious
that our faculty is unbounded) to aesthetical comprehension
in a greater unit, then we mentally feel ourselves
confined aesthetically within bounds. But
nevertheless the pain in regard to the necessary
extension of the Imagination for accordance with
that which is unbounded in our faculty of Reason,
viz. the Idea of the absolute whole, and consequently
the very unpurposiveness of the faculty of Imagination
for rational Ideas and the arousing of them,
are represented as purposive. Thus it is that the
aesthetical judgement itself is subjectively purposive
for the Reason as the source of Ideas, <i>i.e.</i> as the
source of an intellectual comprehension for which all
aesthetical comprehension is small; and there accompanies
the reception of an object as sublime a
pleasure, which is only possible through the medium
of a pain.</p>
<h4 id="B">B.—<span class="smcap">Of the Dynamically Sublime in Nature</span></h4>
<h5 id="s28">§ 28. <i>Of Nature regarded as Might</i></h5>
<p><i>Might</i> is that which is superior to great
hindrances. It is called <i>dominion</i> if it is superior
to the resistance of that which itself possesses might.
Nature considered in an aesthetical judgement as
might that has no dominion over us, is <i>dynamically
sublime</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
If nature is to be judged by us as dynamically
sublime, it must be represented as exciting fear
(although it is not true conversely that every object
which excites fear is regarded in our aesthetical judgement
as sublime). For in aesthetical judgements
(without the aid of concepts) superiority to hindrances
can only be judged according to the greatness of the
resistance. Now that which we are driven to resist
is an evil, and, if we do not find our faculties a match
for it, is an object of fear. Hence nature can be
regarded by the aesthetical Judgement as might, and
consequently as dynamically sublime, only so far as
it is considered an object of fear.</p>
<p>But we can regard an object as <i>fearful</i>, without
being afraid <i>of</i> it; viz. if we judge of it in such a
way that we merely <i>think</i> a case in which we would
wish to resist it, and yet in which all resistance would
be altogether vain. Thus the virtuous man fears
God without being afraid of Him; because to wish
to resist Him and His commandments, he thinks is
a case as to which <i>he</i> need not be anxious. But
in every such case that he thinks as not impossible,
he cognises Him as fearful.</p>
<p>He who fears can form no judgement about the
Sublime in nature; just as he who is seduced by
inclination and appetite can form no judgement about
the Beautiful. The former flies from the sight of
an object which inspires him with awe; and it is impossible
to find satisfaction in a terror that is seriously
felt. Hence the pleasurableness arising from the
cessation of an uneasiness is <i>a state of joy</i>. But
this, on account of the deliverance from danger
[which is involved], is a state of joy conjoined with
the resolve not to expose ourselves to the danger
again; we cannot willingly look back upon our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
sensations [of danger], much less seek the occasion
for them again.</p>
<p>Bold, overhanging, and as it were threatening,
rocks; clouds piled up in the sky, moving with lightning
flashes and thunder peals; volcanoes in all their
violence of destruction; hurricanes with their track
of devastation; the boundless ocean in a state of
tumult; the lofty waterfall of a mighty river, and
such like; these exhibit our faculty of resistance as
insignificantly small in comparison with their might.
But the sight of them is the more attractive, the more
fearful it is, provided only that we are in security;
and we readily call these objects sublime, because
they raise the energies of the soul above their
accustomed height, and discover in us a faculty of
resistance of a quite different kind, which gives us
courage to measure ourselves against the apparent
almightiness of nature.</p>
<p>Now, in the immensity of nature, and in the
inadequacy of our faculties for adopting a standard
proportionate to the aesthetical estimation of the
magnitude of its <i>realm</i>, we find our own limitation;
although at the same time in our rational faculty we
find a different, non-sensuous standard, which has
that infinity itself under it as a unit, and in comparison
with which everything in nature is small. Thus
in our mind we find a superiority to nature even in
its immensity. And so also the irresistibility of its
might, while making us recognise our own [physical<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48" id="FNanchor_48">48</a>]
impotence, considered as beings of nature,
discloses to us a faculty of judging independently of,
and a superiority over, nature; on which is based a
kind of self-preservation, entirely different from that
which can be attacked and brought into danger by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
external nature. Thus, humanity in our person
remains unhumiliated, though the individual might
have to submit to this dominion. In this way nature
is not judged to be sublime in our aesthetical judgements,
in so far as it excites fear; but because it calls
up that power in us (which is not nature) of regarding
as small the things about which we are solicitous
(goods, health, and life), and of regarding its might
(to which we are no doubt subjected in respect of
these things), as nevertheless without any dominion
over us and our personality to which we must bow
where our highest fundamental propositions, and
their assertion or abandonment, are concerned.
Therefore nature is here called sublime merely
because it elevates the Imagination to a presentation
of those cases in which the mind can make felt the
proper sublimity of its destination, in comparison
with nature itself.</p>
<p>This estimation of ourselves loses nothing
through the fact that we must regard ourselves as
safe in order to feel this inspiriting satisfaction;
and that hence, as there is no seriousness in the
danger, there might be also (as might seem to be
the case) just as little seriousness in the sublimity
of our spiritual faculty. For the satisfaction here
concerns only the <i>destination</i> of our faculty which
discloses itself in such a case, so far as the tendency
to this destination lies in our nature, whilst its
development and exercise remain incumbent and
obligatory. And in this there is truth, however
conscious the man may be of his present actual
powerlessness, when he stretches his reflection so
far.</p>
<p>No doubt this principle seems to be too far-fetched
and too subtly reasoned, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
seems to go beyond the scope of an aesthetical
judgement; but observation of men proves the
opposite, and shows that it may lie at the root of the
most ordinary judgements, although we are not
always conscious of it. For what is that which is,
even to the savage, an object of the greatest
admiration? It is a man who shrinks from nothing,
who fears nothing, and therefore does not yield to
danger, but rather goes to face it vigorously with
the fullest deliberation. Even in the most highly
civilised state this peculiar veneration for the soldier
remains, though only under the condition that he
exhibit all the virtues of peace, gentleness, compassion,
and even a becoming care for his own
person; because even by these it is recognised
that his mind is unsubdued by danger. Hence
whatever disputes there may be about the
superiority of the respect which is to be accorded
them, in the comparison of a statesman and a
general, the aesthetical judgement decides for the
latter. War itself, if it is carried on with order and
with a sacred respect for the rights of citizens, has
something sublime in it, and makes the disposition
of the people who carry it on thus, only the more
sublime, the more numerous are the dangers to
which they are exposed, and in respect of which
they behave with courage. On the other hand, a
long peace generally brings about a predominant
commercial spirit, and along with it, low selfishness,
cowardice, and effeminacy, and debases the disposition
of the people.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49" id="FNanchor_49">49</a></p>
<p>It appears to conflict with this solution of the
concept of the sublime, so far as sublimity is
ascribed to might, that we are accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
represent God as presenting Himself in His wrath
and yet in His sublimity, in the tempest, the storm,
the earthquake, etc.; and that it would be foolish
and criminal to imagine a superiority of our minds
over these works of His, and, as it seems, even
over the designs of such might. Hence it would
appear that no feeling of the sublimity of our own
nature, but rather subjection, abasement, and a
feeling of complete powerlessness, is a fitting state
of mind before the manifestation of such an object,
and this is generally bound up with the Idea of it
during natural phenomena of this kind. Generally
in religion, prostration, adoration with bent head,
with contrite, anxious demeanour and voice, seems
to be the only fitting behaviour in presence of
the Godhead; and hence most peoples have
adopted and still observe it. But this state of
mind is far from being necessarily bound up
with the Idea of the <i>sublimity</i> of a religion and
its object. The man who is actually afraid,
because he finds reasons for fear in himself, whilst
conscious by his culpable disposition of offending
against a Might whose will is irresistible and
at the same time just, is not in the frame of mind
for admiring the divine greatness. For this a mood
of calm contemplation and a quite free judgement
are needed. Only if he is conscious of an upright
disposition pleasing to God do those operations of
might serve to awaken in him the Idea of the
sublimity of this Being, for then he recognises in
himself a sublimity of disposition conformable to
His will; and thus he is raised above the fear of
such operations of nature, which he no longer
regards as outbursts of His wrath. Even humility,
in the shape of a stern judgement upon his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
faults,—which otherwise, with a consciousness of good
intentions, could be easily palliated from the frailty
of human nature,—is a sublime state of mind,
consisting in a voluntary subjection of himself to the
pain of remorse, in order that its causes may be
gradually removed. In this way religion is essentially
distinguished from superstition. The latter
establishes in the mind, not reverence for the
Sublime, but fear and apprehension of the all-powerful
Being to whose will the terrified man sees
himself subject, without according Him any high
esteem. From this nothing can arise but a seeking
of favour, and flattery, instead of a religion which
consists in a good life.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50" id="FNanchor_50">50</a></p>
<p>Sublimity, therefore, does not reside in anything
of nature, but only in our mind, in so far as we can
become conscious that we are superior to nature
within, and therefore also to nature without us (so
far as it influences us). Everything that excites
this feeling in us, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>might</i> of nature which
calls forth our forces, is called then (although
improperly) sublime. Only by supposing this Idea
in ourselves, and in reference to it, are we capable of
attaining to the Idea of the sublimity of that Being,
which produces respect in us, not merely by the
might that it displays in nature, but rather by
means of the faculty which resides in us of judging
it fearlessly and of regarding our destination as
sublime in respect of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s29">§ 29. <i>Of the modality of the judgement upon the
sublime in nature</i></h5>
<p>There are numberless beautiful things in nature
about which we can assume and even expect, without
being far mistaken, the harmony of every
one’s judgement with our own. But in respect of
our judgement upon the sublime in nature, we cannot
promise ourselves so easily the accordance of others.
For a far greater culture, as well of the aesthetical
Judgement as of the cognitive faculties which lie
at its basis, seems requisite in order to be able
to pass judgement on this pre-eminent quality of
natural objects.</p>
<p>That the mind be attuned to feel the sublime
postulates a susceptibility of the mind for Ideas.
For in the very inadequacy of nature to these
latter, and thus only by presupposing them and by
straining the Imagination to use nature as a schema
for them, is to be found that which is terrible to
sensibility and yet is attractive. [It is attractive]
because Reason exerts a dominion over sensibility
in order to extend it in conformity with its own
realm (the practical) and to make it look out
into the Infinite, which is for it an abyss. In
fact, without development of moral Ideas, that
which we, prepared by culture, call sublime, presents
itself to the uneducated man merely as terrible.
In the indications of the dominion of nature in
destruction, and in the great scale of its might,
in comparison with which his own is a vanishing
quantity, he will only see the misery, danger, and
distress which surround the man who is exposed to
it. So the good, and indeed intelligent, Savoyard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
peasant (as Herr von <i>Saussure</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51" id="FNanchor_51">51</a> relates) unhesitatingly
called all lovers of snow-mountains fools.
And who knows, whether he would have been so
completely wrong, if Saussure had undertaken
the danger to which he exposed himself merely, as
most travellers do, from amateur curiosity, or that
he might be able to give a pathetic account of them?
But his design was the instruction of men; and
this excellent man gave the readers of his Travels,
soul-stirring sensations such as he himself had, into
the bargain.</p>
<p>But although the judgement upon the Sublime
in nature needs culture (more than the judgement
upon the Beautiful), it is not therefore primarily
produced by culture and introduced in a merely
conventional way into society. Rather has it root
in human nature, even in that which, alike with
common Understanding, we can impute to and
expect of every one, viz. in the tendency to the
feeling for (practical) Ideas, <i>i.e.</i> to the moral feeling.</p>
<p>Hereon is based the necessity of that agreement
of the judgement of others about the sublime with
our own which we include in the latter. For just
as we charge with want of <i>taste</i> the man who is indifferent
when passing judgement upon an object of
nature that we regard as beautiful; so we say of him
who remains unmoved in the presence of that which
we judge to be sublime, he has no <i>feeling</i>. But we
claim both from every man, and we presuppose them
in him if he has any culture at all; only with the
difference, that we expect the former directly of
every one, because in it the Judgement refers the
Imagination merely to the Understanding, the faculty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of concepts; but the latter, because in it the
Imagination is related to the Reason, the faculty of
Ideas, only under a subjective presupposition (which,
however, we believe we are authorised in imputing
to every one), viz. the presupposition of the moral
feeling [in man.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52" id="FNanchor_52">52</a>] Thus it is that we ascribe necessity
to this aesthetical judgement also.</p>
<p>In this modality of aesthetical judgements, viz. in
the necessity claimed for them, lies an important
moment of the Critique of Judgement. For it
enables us to recognise in them an <i>a priori</i> principle,
and raises them out of empirical psychology, in which
otherwise they would remain buried amongst the
feelings of gratification and grief (only with the
unmeaning addition of being called <i>finer</i> feelings).
Thus it enables us too to place the Judgement
among those faculties that have <i>a priori</i> principles
at their basis, and so to bring it into Transcendental
Philosophy.</p>
<hr>
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="remark_2">GENERAL REMARK UPON THE EXPOSITION OF THE AESTHETICAL REFLECTIVE JUDGEMENT</h4>
<p>In reference to the feeling of pleasure an object
is to be classified as either <i>pleasant</i>, or <i>beautiful</i>, or
<i>sublime</i>, or <i>good</i> (absolutely), (<i>jucundum</i>, <i>pulchrum</i>,
<i>sublime</i>, <i>honestum</i>).</p>
<p>The <i>pleasant</i>, as motive of desire, is always of
one and the same kind, no matter whence it comes
and however specifically different the representation
(of sense, and sensation objectively considered)
may be. Hence in judging its influence on the
mind, account is taken only of the number of its
charms (simultaneous and successive), and so only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of the mass, as it were, of the pleasant sensation;
and this can be made intelligible only by <i>quantity</i>.
It has no reference to culture, but belongs to mere
enjoyment.—On the other hand, the <i>beautiful</i>
requires the representation of a certain <i>quality</i> of
the Object, that can be made intelligible and
reduced to concepts (although it is not so reduced
in an aesthetical judgement); and it cultivates us, in
that it teaches us to attend to the purposiveness
in the feeling of pleasure.—The <i>sublime</i> consists
merely in the <i>relation</i> by which the sensible in the
representation of nature is judged available for a
possible supersensible use.—The <i>absolutely good</i>,
subjectively judged according to the feeling that
it inspires (the Object of the moral feeling), as
capable of determining the powers of the subject
through the representation of an <i>absolutely compelling</i>
law, is specially distinguished by the <i>modality</i>
of a necessity that rests <i>a priori</i> upon concepts.
This necessity involves not merely a <i>claim</i>, but a
<i>command</i> for the assent of every one, and belongs
in itself to the pure intellectual, rather than to the
aesthetical Judgement; and is by a determinant and
not a mere reflective judgement ascribed not to
Nature but to Freedom. But the <i>determinability
of the subject</i> by means of this Idea, and especially
of a subject that can feel <i>hindrances</i> in sensibility,
and at the same time its superiority to them by their
subjugation involving a <i>modification of its state</i>—<i>i.e.</i>
the moral feeling,—is yet so far cognate to the
aesthetical Judgement and its formal conditions
that it can serve to represent the conformity to
law of action from duty as aesthetical, <i>i.e.</i> as
sublime or even as beautiful, without losing its
purity. This would not be so, if we were to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
it in natural combination with the feeling of the
pleasant.</p>
<p>If we take the result of the foregoing exposition
of the two kinds of aesthetical judgements, there
arise therefrom the following short explanations:</p>
<p>The <i>Beautiful</i> is what pleases in the mere
judgement (and therefore not by the medium of
sensation in accordance with a concept of the Understanding).
It follows at once from this that it
must please apart from all interest.</p>
<p>The <i>Sublime</i> is what pleases immediately through
its opposition to the interest of sense.</p>
<p>Both, as explanations of aesthetical universally
valid judging, are referred to subjective grounds;
in the one case to grounds of sensibility, in favour of
the contemplative Understanding; in the other case
<i>in opposition to</i> sensibility, but on behalf of the purposes
of practical Reason. Both, however, united
in the same subject, are purposive in reference to
the moral feeling. The Beautiful prepares us to
love disinterestedly something, even nature itself;
the Sublime prepares us to esteem something highly
even in opposition to our own (sensible) interest.</p>
<p>We may describe the Sublime thus: it is an
object (of nature) <i>the representation of which determines
the mind to think the unattainability of nature
regarded as a presentation of Ideas</i>.</p>
<p>Literally taken and logically considered, Ideas
cannot be presented. But if we extend our empirical
representative faculty (mathematically or
dynamically) to the intuition of nature, Reason
inevitably intervenes, as the faculty expressing the
independence of absolute totality,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53" id="FNanchor_53">53</a> and generates the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
effort of the mind, vain though it be, to make the
representation of the senses adequate to this. This
effort,—and the feeling of the unattainability of the
Idea by means of the Imagination,—is itself a presentation
of the subjective purposiveness of our
mind in the employment of the Imagination for its
supersensible destination; and forces us, subjectively,
to <i>think</i> nature itself in its totality as a presentation
of something supersensible, without being
able <i>objectively</i> to arrive at this presentation.</p>
<p>For we soon see that nature in space and time
entirely lacks the unconditioned, and, consequently,
that absolute magnitude, which yet is desired by
the most ordinary Reason. It is by this that we
are reminded that we only have to do with nature
as phenomenon, and that it must be regarded as
the mere presentation of a nature in itself (of which
Reason has the Idea). But this Idea of the supersensible,
which we can no further determine,—so
that we cannot <i>know</i> but only <i>think</i> nature as its
presentation,—is awakened in us by means of an
object, whose aesthetical appreciation strains the
Imagination to its utmost bounds, whether of extension
(mathematical) or of its might over the
mind (dynamical). And this judgement is based
upon a feeling of the mind’s destination, which
entirely surpasses the realm of the former (<i>i.e.</i> upon
the moral feeling), in respect of which the representation
of the object is judged as subjectively
purposive.</p>
<p>In fact, a feeling for the Sublime in nature
cannot well be thought without combining therewith
a mental disposition which is akin to the Moral.
And although the immediate pleasure in the Beautiful
of nature likewise presupposes and cultivates a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
certain <i>liberality</i> in our mental attitude, <i>i.e.</i> a satisfaction
independent of mere sensible enjoyment, yet
freedom is thus represented as in <i>play</i> rather than
in that law-directed <i>occupation</i> which is the genuine
characteristic of human morality, in which Reason
must exercise dominion over Sensibility. But in
aesthetical judgements upon the Sublime this dominion
is represented as exercised by the Imagination,
regarded as an instrument of Reason.</p>
<p>The satisfaction in the Sublime of nature is
then only <i>negative</i> (whilst that in the Beautiful is
<i>positive</i>); viz. a feeling that the Imagination is
depriving itself of its freedom, while it is purposively
determined according to a different law from that
of its empirical employment. It thus acquires an
extension and a might greater than it sacrifices,—the
ground of which, however, is concealed from
itself; whilst yet it <i>feels</i> the sacrifice or the
deprivation and, at the same time, the cause to
which it is subjected. <i>Astonishment</i>, that borders
upon terror, the dread and the holy awe which
seizes the observer at the sight of mountain peaks
rearing themselves to heaven, deep chasms and
streams raging therein, deep-shadowed solitudes
that dispose one to melancholy meditations—this,
in the safety in which we know ourselves to be, is
not actual fear, but only an attempt to feel fear by
the aid of the Imagination; that we may feel the
might of this faculty in combining with the mind’s
repose the mental movement thereby excited, and
being thus superior to internal nature,—and therefore
to external,—so far as this can have any influence
on our feeling of well-being. For the Imagination
by the laws of Association makes our state of contentment
dependent on physical [causes]; but it also,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
by the principles of the Schematism of the Judgement
(being so far, therefore, ranked under freedom), is
the instrument of Reason and its Ideas, and, as such,
has might to maintain our independence of natural
influences, to regard as small what in reference to
them is great, and so to place the absolutely great
only in the proper destination of the subject. The
raising of this reflection of the aesthetical Judgement
so as to be adequate to Reason (though without a
definite concept of Reason) represents the object as
subjectively purposive, even by the objective want
of accordance between the Imagination in its greatest
extension and the Reason (as the faculty of Ideas).</p>
<p>We must here, generally, attend to what has
been already noted, that in the Transcendental
Aesthetic of Judgement we must speak solely of pure
aesthetical judgements; consequently our examples
are not to be taken from such beautiful or sublime
objects of Nature as presuppose the concept of a
purpose. For, if so, the purposiveness would be
either teleological, or would be based on mere sensations
of an object (gratification or grief); and thus
would be in the former case not aesthetical, in the
latter not merely formal. If then we call the sight
of the starry heaven <i>sublime</i>, we must not place at
the basis of our judgement concepts of worlds
inhabited by rational beings, and regard the bright
points, with which we see the space above us filled,
as their suns moving in circles purposively fixed
with reference to them; but we must regard it,
just as we see it, as a distant, all-embracing vault.
Only under such a representation can we range that
sublimity which a pure aesthetical judgement ascribes
to this object. And in the same way, if we are to
call the sight of the ocean sublime, we must not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
<i>think</i> of it as we [ordinarily] do, endowed as we are
with all kinds of knowledge (not contained, however,
in the immediate intuition). For example, we sometimes
think of the ocean as a vast kingdom of aquatic
creatures; or as the great source of those vapours
that fill the air with clouds for the benefit of the
land; or again as an element which, though dividing
continents from each other, yet promotes the greatest
communication between them: but these furnish
merely teleological judgements. To call the ocean
sublime we must regard it as poets do, merely by
what strikes the eye; if it is at rest, as a clear
mirror of water only bounded by the heaven; if
it is restless, as an abyss threatening to overwhelm
everything. The like is to be said of the Sublime
and Beautiful in the human figure. We must not
regard as the determining grounds of our judgement
the concepts of the purposes which all our limbs serve,
and we must not allow this coincidence to <i>influence</i>
our aesthetical judgement (for then it would no longer
be pure); although it is certainly a necessary condition
of aesthetical satisfaction that there should be
no conflict between them. Aesthetical purposiveness
is the conformity to law of the Judgement in its <i>freedom</i>.
The satisfaction in the object depends on
the relation in which we wish to place the Imagination;
always provided that it by itself entertains the
mind in free occupation. If, on the other hand,
the judgement be determined by anything else,—whether
sensation or concept,—although it may be
conformable to law, it cannot be the act of a <i>free</i>
Judgement.</p>
<p>If then we speak of intellectual beauty or sublimity,
these expressions are, <i>first</i>, not quite accurate,
because beauty and sublimity are aesthetical modes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of representation, which would not be found in us at
all if we were pure intelligences (or even regarded
ourselves as such in thought). <i>Secondly</i>, although
both, as objects of an intellectual (moral) satisfaction,
are so far compatible with aesthetical satisfaction
that they <i>rest</i> upon no interest, yet they are difficult
to unite with it, because they are meant to <i>produce</i>
an interest. This, if its presentation is to harmonise
with the satisfaction in the aesthetical judgement,
could only arise by means of a sensible interest that
we combine with it in the presentation; and thus
damage would be done to the intellectual purposiveness,
and it would lose its purity.</p>
<p>The object of a pure and unconditioned intellectual
satisfaction is the Moral Law in that might
which it exercises in us over all mental motives <i>that
precede it</i>. This might only makes itself aesthetically
known to us through sacrifices (which causing a
feeling of deprivation, though on behalf of internal
freedom, in return discloses in us an unfathomable
depth of this supersensible faculty, with consequences
extending beyond our ken); thus the satisfaction on
the aesthetical side (in relation to sensibility) is negative,
<i>i.e.</i> against this interest, but regarded from the
intellectual side it is positive and combined with an
interest. Hence it follows that the intellectual, in
itself purposive, (moral) good, aesthetically judged,
must be represented as sublime rather than beautiful,
so that it rather awakens the feeling of respect
(which disdains charm) than that of love and familiar
inclination; for human nature does not attach itself
to this good spontaneously, but only by the authority
which Reason exercises over Sensibility. Conversely
also, that which we call sublime in nature,
whether external or internal (<i>e.g.</i> certain affections),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
is only represented as a might in the mind to
overcome [<i>certain</i>]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54" id="FNanchor_54">54</a> hindrances of the Sensibility by
means of moral fundamental propositions, and only
thus does it interest.</p>
<p>I will dwell a moment on this latter point. The
Idea of the Good conjoined with affection is called
<i>enthusiasm</i>. This state of mind seems to be
sublime, to the extent that we commonly assert that
nothing great could be done without it. Now every
affection<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55" id="FNanchor_55">55</a> is blind, either in the choice of its purpose,
or, if this be supplied by Reason, in its accomplishment;
for it is a mental movement which makes
it impossible to exercise a free deliberation about
fundamental propositions so as to determine ourselves
thereby. It can therefore in no way deserve
the approval of the Reason. Nevertheless, aesthetically,
enthusiasm is sublime, because it is a tension
of forces produced by Ideas, which give an impulse
to the mind, that operates far more powerfully and
lastingly than the impulse arising from sensible
representations. But (which seems strange) the
<i>absence of affection</i> (<i>apatheia, phlegma in significatu
bono</i>) in a mind that vigorously follows its unalterable
principles is sublime, and in a far preferable
way, because it has also on its side the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of pure Reason.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56" id="FNanchor_56">56</a> It is only a mental state of this kind
that is called noble; and this expression is subsequently
applied to things, <i>e.g.</i> a building, a garment,
literary style, bodily presence, etc., when these do not
so much arouse <i>astonishment</i> (the affection produced
by the representation of novelty exceeding our
expectations), as <i>admiration</i> (astonishment that does
not cease when the novelty disappears); and this
is the case when Ideas agree in their presentation
undesignedly and artlessly with the aesthetical
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every affection of the <span class="smcap smaller">STRENUOUS</span> kind (viz. that
excites the consciousness of our power to overcome
every obstacle—<i>animi strenui</i>) is <i>aesthetically sublime</i>,
<i>e.g.</i> wrath, even despair (<i>i.e.</i> the despair of <i>indignation</i>,
not of <i>faintheartedness</i>). But affections of the
<span class="smcap smaller">LANGUID</span> kind (which make the very effort of resistance
an object of pain—<i>animum languidum</i>) have
nothing <i>noble</i> in themselves, but they may be reckoned
under the sensuously beautiful. <i>Emotions</i>, which may
rise to the strength of affections, are very different.
We have both <i>spirited</i> and <i>tender</i> emotions. The
latter, if they rise to the height of affections, are
worthless; the propensity to them is called <i>sentimentality</i>.
A sympathetic grief that will not admit
of consolation, or one referring to imaginary evils to
which we deliberately surrender ourselves—being
deceived by fancy—as if they were actual, indicates
and produces a tender,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57" id="FNanchor_57">57</a> though weak, soul—which
shows a beautiful side and which can be called
fanciful, though not enthusiastic. Romances, lacrymose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
plays, shallow moral precepts, which toy with
(falsely) so-called moral dispositions, but in fact
make the heart languid, insensible to the severe
precept of duty, and incapable of all respect for the
worth of humanity in our own person, and for the
rights of men (a very different thing from their
happiness), and in general incapable of all steady
principle; even a religious discourse,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58" id="FNanchor_58">58</a> which recommends
a cringing, abject seeking of favour and
ingratiation of ourselves, which proposes the
abandonment of all confidence in our own faculties
in opposition to the evil within us, instead of a
sturdy resolution to endeavour to overcome our
inclinations by means of those powers which with all
our frailty yet remain to us; that false humility
which sets the only way of pleasing the Supreme
Being in self-depreciation, in whining hypocritical
repentance and in a mere passive state of mind—these
are not compatible with any frame of mind
that can be counted beautiful, still less with one
which is to be counted sublime.</p>
<p>But even stormy movements of mind which may
be connected under the name of edification with
Ideas of religion, or—as merely belonging to culture—with
Ideas containing a social interest, can in no
way, however they strain the Imagination, lay claim
to the honour of being <i>sublime</i> presentations, unless
they leave after them a mental mood which, although
only indirectly, has influence upon the mind’s
consciousness of its strength, and its resolution in
reference to that which involves pure intellectual
purposiveness (the supersensible). For otherwise
all these emotions belong only to <i>motion</i>, which one
would fain enjoy for the sake of health. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
pleasant exhaustion, consequent upon such disturbance
produced by the play of the affections, is
an enjoyment of our well-being arising from the
restored equilibrium of the various vital forces.
This in the end amounts to the same thing as that
state which Eastern voluptuaries find so delightful,
when they get their bodies as it were kneaded and
all their muscles and joints softly pressed and bent;
only that in this case the motive principle is for the
most part external, in the other case it is altogether
internal. Many a man believes himself to be edified
by a sermon, when indeed there is no edification at
all (no system of good maxims); or to be improved
by a tragedy, when he is only glad at his ennui being
happily dispelled. So the Sublime must always have
reference to the <i>disposition</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to the maxims which
furnish to the intellectual [part] and to the Ideas of
Reason a superiority over sensibility.</p>
<p>We need not fear that the feeling of the sublime
will lose by so abstract a mode of presentation,—which
is quite negative in respect of what is sensible,—for
the Imagination, although it finds nothing beyond
the sensible to which it can attach itself, yet
feels itself unbounded by this removal of its limitations;
and thus that very abstraction is a presentation
of the Infinite, which can be nothing but a mere
negative presentation, but which yet expands the
soul. Perhaps there is no sublimer passage in the
Jewish Law than the command, <i>Thou shalt not
make to thyself any graven image, nor the likeness
of anything which is in heaven or on the earth or
under the earth</i>, etc. This command alone can
explain the enthusiasm that the Jewish people in
their moral period felt for their religion, when they
compared themselves with other peoples; or explain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the pride which Mahommedanism inspires. The
same is true of the moral law and of the tendency to
morality in us. It is quite erroneous to fear that if
we deprive this [tendency] of all that can recommend
it to sense it will only involve a cold lifeless assent
and no moving force or emotion. It is quite the other
way, for where the senses see nothing more before
them, and the unmistakable and indelible Idea of
morality remains, it would be rather necessary to
moderate the impetus of an unbounded Imagination,
to prevent it from rising to enthusiasm, than through
fear of the powerlessness of these Ideas to seek aid
for them in images and childish ritual. Thus
governments have willingly allowed religion to be
abundantly provided with the latter accessories;
and seeking thereby to relieve their subjects of
trouble, they have also sought to deprive them of
the faculty of extending their spiritual powers beyond
the limits that are arbitrarily assigned to them, and
by means of which they can be the more easily
treated as mere passive<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59" id="FNanchor_59">59</a> beings.</p>
<p>This pure, elevating, merely negative presentation
of morality brings with it, on the other hand, no
danger of <i>fanaticism</i>, which is <i>a delusion that we can
will ourselves to see something beyond all bounds of
sensibility</i>, <i>i.e.</i> to dream in accordance with fundamental
propositions (or to go mad with Reason); and
this is so just because this presentation is merely
negative. For the <i>inscrutableness of the Idea of
Freedom</i> quite cuts it off from any positive presentation;
but the moral law is in itself sufficiently
and originally determinant in us, so that it does
not permit us to cast a glance at any ground of
determination external to itself. If enthusiasm is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
comparable to <i>madness</i>, fanaticism is comparable to
<i>monomania</i>; of which the latter is least of all compatible
with the sublime, because in its detail it is
ridiculous. In enthusiasm, regarded as an affection,
the Imagination is without bridle; in fanaticism,
regarded as an inveterate, brooding passion, it is
without rule. The first is a transitory accident
which sometimes befalls the soundest Understanding;
the second is a disease which unsettles it.</p>
<p><i>Simplicity</i> (purposiveness without art) is as it
were the style of Nature in the sublime, and so also
of Morality which is a second (supersensible) nature;
of which we only know the laws without being able
to reach by intuition that supersensible faculty in ourselves
which contains the ground of the legislation.</p>
<p>Now the satisfaction in the Beautiful, like that in
the Sublime, is not alone distinguishable from other
aesthetical judgements by its universal <i>communicability</i>,
but also because, through this very property,
it acquires an interest in reference to society (in
which this communication is possible). We must,
however, remark that <i>separation from all society</i> is
regarded as sublime, if it rests upon Ideas that overlook
all sensible interest. To be sufficient for oneself,
and consequently to have no need of society,
without at the same time being unsociable, <i>i.e.</i>
without flying from it, is something bordering on
the sublime; as is any dispensing with wants. On
the other hand, to fly from men from <i>misanthropy</i>,
because we bear ill-will to them, or from <i>anthropophoby</i>
(shyness), because we fear them as foes, is
partly hateful, partly contemptible. There is indeed
a misanthropy (very improperly so-called), the
tendency to which frequently appears with old age
in many right-thinking men; which is philanthropic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
enough as far as <i>goodwill</i> to men is concerned, but
which through long and sad experience is far removed
from <i>satisfaction</i> with men. Evidence of this is
afforded by the propensity to solitude, the fantastic
wish for a secluded country seat, or (in the case of
young persons) by the dream of the happiness of
passing one’s life with a little family upon some
island unknown to the rest of the world; a dream
of which story-tellers or writers of Robinsonades
know how to make good use. Falsehood, ingratitude,
injustice, the childishness of the purposes
regarded by ourselves as important and great, in
the pursuit of which men inflict upon each other all
imaginable evils, are so contradictory to the Idea of
what men might be if they would, and conflict so
with our lively wish to see them better, that, in
order that we may not hate them (since we cannot
love them), the renunciation of all social joys seems
but a small sacrifice. This sadness—not the sadness
(of which sympathy is the cause) for the evils
which fate brings upon others,—but for those things
which men do to one another (which depends upon
an antipathy in fundamental propositions), is sublime,
because it rests upon Ideas, whilst the former can
only count as beautiful.—The brilliant and thorough
<i>Saussure</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60" id="FNanchor_60">60</a> in his account of his Alpine travels, says
of one of the Savoy mountains, called <i>Bonhomme</i>,
“There reigns there a certain <i>insipid sadness</i>.” He
therefore recognised an <i>interesting</i> sadness, that the
sight of a solitude might inspire, to which men
might wish to transport themselves that they might
neither hear nor experience any more of the world;
which, however, would not be quite so inhospitable
that it would offer only an extremely painful retreat.—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>I
make this remark solely with the design of indicating
again that even depression (not dejected
sadness) may be counted among the <i>sturdy</i> affections,
if it has its ground in moral Ideas. But if it is
grounded on sympathy and, as such, is amiable, it
belongs merely to the <i>languid</i> affections. [I make
this remark] to call attention to the state of mind
which is <i>sublime</i> only in the first case.</p>
<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p>We can now compare the above Transcendental
Exposition of aesthetical judgements with the
Physiological worked out by <i>Burke</i> and by many
clear-headed men among us, in order to see whither
a merely empirical exposition of the Sublime and
Beautiful leads. <i>Burke</i>, who deserves to be regarded
as the most important author who adopts
this mode of treatment, infers by this method “that
the feeling of the Sublime rests on the impulse towards
self-preservation and on <i>fear</i>, <i>i.e.</i> on a pain,
which not going so far as actually to derange the
parts of the body, produces movements which, since
they purify the finer or grosser vessels of dangerous
or troublesome stoppages, are capable of exciting
pleasant sensations; not indeed pleasure, but a kind
of satisfying horror, a certain tranquillity tinged
with terror.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61" id="FNanchor_61">61</a> The Beautiful, which he founded on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
love (which he wishes to keep quite separate from
desire), he reduces to “the relaxing, slackening, and
enervating of the fibres of the body, and a consequent
weakening, languor, and exhaustion, a fainting,
dissolving, and melting away for enjoyment.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62" id="FNanchor_62">62</a>
And he confirms this explanation not only by cases
in which the Imagination in combination with the
Understanding can excite in us the feeling of the
Beautiful or of the Sublime, but by cases in which
it is combined with sensation.—As psychological
observations, these analyses of the phenomena of
our mind are exceedingly beautiful, and afford rich
material for the favourite investigations of empirical
anthropology. It is also not to be denied that all
representations in us, whether, objectively viewed,
they are merely sensible or are quite intellectual,
may yet subjectively be united to gratification or
grief, however imperceptible either may be; because
they all affect the feeling of life, and none of them,
so far as it is a modification of the subject, can be
indifferent. And so, as Epicurus maintained, all
<i>gratification</i> or <i>grief</i> may ultimately be corporeal,
whether it arises from the representations of the
Imagination or the Understanding; because life
without a feeling of bodily organs would be merely
a consciousness of existence, without any feeling of
well-being or the reverse, <i>i.e.</i> of the furthering or
the checking of the vital powers. For the mind
is by itself alone life (the principle of life), and
hindrances or furtherances must be sought outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
it and yet in the man, consequently in union with
his body.</p>
<p>If, however, we place the satisfaction in the
object altogether in the fact that it gratifies us by
charm or emotion, we must not assume that any
<i>other</i> man agrees with the aesthetical judgement
which <i>we</i> pass; for as to these each one rightly
consults his own individual sensibility. But in that
case all censorship of taste would disappear, except
indeed the example afforded by the accidental agreement
of others in their judgements were regarded
as <i>commanding</i> our assent; and this principle we
should probably resist, and should appeal to the
natural right of subjecting the judgement, which
rests on the immediate feeling of our own well-being,
to our own sense and not to that of any
other man.</p>
<p>If then the judgement of taste is not to be valid
merely <i>egoistically</i>, but according to its inner nature,—<i>i.e.</i>
on account of itself and not on account of the
examples that others give of their taste,—to be
necessarily valid <i>pluralistically</i>, if we regard it as a
judgement which may exact the adhesion of every
one; then there must lie at its basis some <i>a priori</i>
principle (whether objective or subjective) to which
we can never attain by seeking out the empirical
laws of mental changes. For these only enable us
to know how we judge, but do not prescribe to us
how we ought to judge. They do not supply an
<i>unconditioned</i> command,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63" id="FNanchor_63">63</a> such as judgements of
taste presuppose, inasmuch as they require that
the satisfaction be <i>immediately</i> connected with the
representation. Thus the empirical exposition of
aesthetical judgements may be a beginning of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
collection of materials for a higher investigation;
but a transcendental discussion of this faculty is also
possible, and is an essential part of the Critique of
Taste. For if it had not <i>a priori</i> principles, it could
not possibly pass sentence on the judgements of
others, and it could not approve or blame them
with any appearance of right.</p>
<p>The remaining part of the Analytic of the
Aesthetical Judgement contains first the</p>
<h4 id="deduction_2">DEDUCTION OF [PURE<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64" id="FNanchor_64">64</a>] AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENTS</h4>
<h5 id="s30">§ 30. <i>The Deduction of aesthetical judgements on the
objects of nature must not be directed to what
we call Sublime in nature, but only to the
Beautiful.</i></h5>
<p>The claim of an aesthetical judgement to universal
validity for every subject requires, as a judgement
resting on some <i>a priori</i> principle, a Deduction
(or legitimatising of its pretensions) in addition to
its Exposition; if it is concerned with satisfaction
or dissatisfaction in the <i>form of the Object</i>. Of this
kind are judgements of taste about the Beautiful in
Nature. For in that case the purposiveness has its
ground in the Object and in its figure, although it
does not indicate the reference of this to other objects
according to concepts (for a cognitive judgement),
but merely has to do in general with the apprehension
of this form, so far as it shows itself conformable
in the mind to the <i>faculty</i> of concepts and
to that of their presentation (which is identical with
that of apprehension). We can thus, in respect of
the Beautiful in nature, suggest many questions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
touching the cause of this purposiveness of their
forms, <i>e.g.</i> to explain why nature has scattered
abroad beauty with such profusion, even in the
depth of the ocean, where the human eye (for
which alone that purposiveness exists) but seldom
penetrates.</p>
<p>But the Sublime in nature—if we are passing
upon it a pure aesthetical judgement, not mixed up
with any concepts of perfection or objective purposiveness,
in which case it would be a teleological
judgement—may be regarded as quite formless or
devoid of figure, and yet as the object of a pure
satisfaction; and it may display a subjective purposiveness
in the given representation. And we
ask if, for an aesthetical judgement of this kind,—over
and above the Exposition of what is thought
in it,—a Deduction also of its claim to any (subjective)
<i>a priori</i> principle may be demanded?</p>
<p>To which we may answer that the Sublime in
nature is improperly so called, and that properly
speaking the word should only be applied to a
state of mind, or rather to its foundation in
human nature. The apprehension of an otherwise
formless and unpurposive object gives merely the
occasion, through which we become conscious of
such a state; the object is thus <i>employed</i> as
subjectively purposive, but is not judged as such
<i>in itself</i> and on account of its form (it is, as it were,
a <i>species finalis accepta, non data</i>). Hence our
Exposition of judgements concerning the Sublime
in nature was at the same time their Deduction.
For when we analysed the reflection of the Judgement
in such acts, we found in them a purposive
relation of the cognitive faculties, which must be
ascribed ultimately to the faculty of purposes (the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
will), and hence is itself purposive <i>a priori</i>. This
then immediately involves the Deduction, <i>i.e.</i> the
justification of the claim of such a judgement to
universal and necessary validity.</p>
<p>We shall therefore only have to seek for the
deduction of judgements of Taste, <i>i.e.</i> of judgements
about the Beauty of natural things; we shall thus
treat satisfactorily the problem with which the whole
faculty of aesthetical Judgement is concerned.</p>
<h5 id="s31">§ 31. <i>Of the method of deduction of judgements
of Taste</i></h5>
<p>A Deduction, <i>i.e.</i> the guarantee of the legitimacy
of a class of judgements, is only obligatory if the
judgement lays claim to necessity. This it does, if
it demands even subjective universality or the agreement
of every one, although it is not a judgement
of cognition but only one of pleasure or pain in a
given object; <i>i.e.</i> it assumes a subjective purposiveness
thoroughly valid for every one, which must
not be based on any concept of the thing, because
the judgement is one of taste.</p>
<p>We have before us in the latter case no cognitive
judgement—neither a theoretical one based on the
concept of a <i>Nature</i> in general formed by the
Understanding, nor a (pure) practical one based on
the Idea of <i>Freedom</i>, as given <i>a priori</i> by Reason.
Therefore we have to justify <i>a priori</i> the validity
neither of a judgement which represents what a
thing is, nor of one which prescribes that I ought
to do something in order to produce it. We have
merely to prove for the Judgement generally the
<i>universal validity</i> of a singular judgement that expresses
the subjective purposiveness of an empirical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
representation of the form of an object; in order
to explain how it is possible that a thing can please
in the mere act of judging it (without sensation or
concept), and how the satisfaction of one man can
be proclaimed as a rule for every other; just as the
act of judging of an object for the sake of a <i>cognition</i>
in general has universal rules.</p>
<p>If now this universal validity is not to be based
on any collecting of the suffrages of others, or on
any questioning of them as to the kind of sensations
they have, but is to rest, as it were, on an autonomy
of the judging subject in respect of the feeling of
pleasure (in the given representation), <i>i.e.</i> on his
own taste, and yet is not to be derived from concepts;
then a judgement like this—such as the
judgement of taste is, in fact—has a twofold logical
peculiarity. <i>First</i>, there is its <i>a priori</i> universal
validity, which is not a logical universality in accordance
with concepts, but the universality of a
singular judgement. <i>Secondly</i>, it has a necessity
(which must always rest on <i>a priori</i> grounds),
which however does not depend on any <i>a priori</i>
grounds of proof, through the representation of
which the assent that every one concedes to the
judgement of taste could be exacted.</p>
<p>The solution of these logical peculiarities,
wherein a judgement of taste is different from all
cognitive judgements—if we at the outset abstract
from all content, viz. from the feeling of pleasure,
and merely compare the aesthetical form with the
form of objective judgements as logic prescribes it—is
sufficient by itself for the deduction of this
singular faculty. We shall then represent and
elucidate by examples these characteristic properties
of taste.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s32">§ 32. <i>First peculiarity of the judgement of Taste</i></h5>
<p>The judgement of taste determines its object in
respect of satisfaction (in its beauty) with an accompanying
claim for the assent of <i>every one</i>, just
as if it were objective.</p>
<p>To say that “this flower is beautiful” is the
same as to assert its proper claim to satisfy every
one. By the pleasantness of its smell it has no
such claim. A smell which one man enjoys gives
another a headache. Now what are we to presume
from this except that beauty is to be regarded as
a property of the flower itself, which does not
accommodate itself to any diversity of persons or
of their sensitive organs, but to which these must
accommodate themselves if they are to pass any
judgement upon it? And yet this is not so. For
a judgement of taste consists in calling a thing
beautiful just because of that characteristic in respect
of which it accommodates itself to our mode of
apprehension.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is required of every judgement which
is to prove the taste of the subject, that the subject
shall judge by himself, without needing to grope
about empirically among the judgements of others,
and acquaint himself previously as to their satisfaction
or dissatisfaction with the same object; thus
his judgement should be pronounced <i>a priori</i>, and
not be a mere imitation because the thing actually
gives universal pleasure. One would think, however,
that an <i>a priori</i> judgement must contain a
concept of the Object, for the cognition of which
it contains the principle; but the judgement of taste
is not based upon concepts at all, and is in general
not a cognitive but an aesthetical judgement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Thus a young poet does not permit himself to
be dissuaded from his conviction that his poem is
beautiful, by the judgement of the public or of his
friends; and if he gives ear to them he does so,
not because he now judges differently, but because,
although (in regard to him) the whole public has
false taste, in his desire for applause he finds reason
for accommodating himself to the common error
(even against his judgement). It is only at a later
time, when his Judgement has been sharpened by
exercise, that he voluntarily departs from his former
judgements; just as he proceeds with those of his
judgements which rest upon Reason. Taste
[merely]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65" id="FNanchor_65">65</a> claims autonomy. To make the judgements
of others the determining grounds of his own
would be heteronomy.</p>
<p>That we, and rightly, recommend the works of
the ancients as models and call their authors classical,
thus forming among writers a kind of noble class
who give laws to the people by their example, seems
to indicate <i>a posteriori</i> sources of taste, and to contradict
the autonomy of taste in every subject. But
we might just as well say that the old mathematicians,—who
are regarded up to the present day as supplying
models not easily to be dispensed with for the
supreme profundity and elegance of their synthetical
methods,—prove that our Reason is only imitative,
and that we have not the faculty of producing from
it in combination with intuition rigid proofs by
means of the construction of concepts.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66" id="FNanchor_66">66</a> There is
no use of our powers, however free, no use of
Reason itself (which must create all its judgements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
<i>a priori</i> from common sources) which would not
give rise to faulty attempts, if every subject had
always to begin anew from the rude basis of his
natural state, and if others had not preceded him
with their attempts. Not that these make mere
imitators of those who come after them, but rather
by their procedure they put others on the track
of seeking in themselves principles and so of pursuing
their own course, often a better one. Even in
religion—where certainly every one has to derive
the rule of his conduct from himself, because he
remains responsible for it and cannot shift the
blame of his transgressions upon others, whether
his teachers or his predecessors—there is never
as much accomplished by means of universal precepts,
either obtained from priests or philosophers
or got from oneself, as by means of an example
of virtue or holiness which, exhibited in history,
does not dispense with the autonomy of virtue
based on the proper and original Idea of morality
(<i>a priori</i>), or change it into a mechanical imitation.
<i>Following</i>, involving something precedent, not
“imitation,” is the right expression for all influence
that the products of an exemplary author may
have upon others. And this only means that we
draw from the same sources as our predecessor
did, and learn from him only the way to avail
ourselves of them. But of all faculties and talents
Taste, because its judgement is not determinable by
concepts and precepts, is just that one which most
needs examples of what has in the progress of culture
received the longest approval; that it may not
become again uncivilised and return to the crudeness
of its first essays.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s33">§ 33. <i>Second peculiarity of the judgement of Taste</i></h5>
<p>The judgement of taste is not determinable by
grounds of proof, just as if it were merely <i>subjective</i>.</p>
<p>If a man, <i>in the first place</i>, does not find a building,
a prospect, or a poem beautiful, a hundred voices
all highly praising it will not force his inmost agreement.
He may indeed feign that it pleases him in
order that he may not be regarded as devoid of
taste; he may even begin to doubt whether he has
formed his taste on a knowledge of a sufficient
number of objects of a certain kind (just as one,
who believes that he recognises in the distance as a
forest, something which all others regard as a town,
doubts the judgement of his own sight). But he
clearly sees that the agreement of others gives no
valid proof of the judgement about beauty. Others
might perhaps see and observe for him; and what
many have seen in one way, although he believes
that he has seen it differently, might serve him as
an adequate ground of proof of a theoretical and
consequently logical judgement. But that a thing
has pleased others could never serve as the basis
of an aesthetical judgement. A judgement of others
which is unfavourable to ours may indeed rightly
make us scrutinise our own with care, but it can
never convince us of its incorrectness. There is
therefore no empirical <i>ground of proof</i> which would
force a judgement of taste upon any one.</p>
<p>Still less, <i>in the second place</i>, can an <i>a priori</i>
proof determine according to definite rules a judgement
about beauty. If a man reads me a poem of
his or brings me to a play, which does not after
all suit my taste, he may bring forward in proof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of the beauty of his poem <i>Batteux</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67" id="FNanchor_67">67</a> or <i>Lessing</i> or
still more ancient and famous critics of taste, and
all the rules laid down by them; certain passages
which displease me may agree very well with rules
of beauty (as they have been put forth by these
writers and are universally recognised): but I stop
my ears, I will listen to no arguments and no
reasoning; and I will rather assume that these rules
of the critics are false, or at least that they do not
apply to the case in question, than admit that my
judgement should be determined by grounds of proof
<i>a priori</i>. For it is to be a judgement of Taste and
not of Understanding or Reason.</p>
<p>It seems that this is one of the chief reasons
why this aesthetical faculty of judgement has been
given the name of Taste. For though a man
enumerate to me all the ingredients of a dish, and
remark that each is separately pleasant to me and
further extol with justice the wholesomeness of this
particular food—yet am I deaf to all these reasons;
I try the dish with <i>my</i> tongue and my palate, and
thereafter (and not according to universal principles)
do I pass my judgement.</p>
<p>In fact the judgement of Taste always takes the
form of a singular judgement about an Object. The
Understanding can form a universal judgement by
comparing the Object in point of the satisfaction it
affords with the judgement of others upon it: <i>e.g.</i>
“all tulips are beautiful.” But then this is not a
judgement of taste but a logical judgement, which
takes the relation of an Object to taste as the
predicate of things of a certain species. That
judgement, however, in which I find an individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
given tulip beautiful, <i>i.e.</i> in which I find my satisfaction
in it to be universally valid, is alone a
judgement of taste. Its peculiarity consists in the
fact that, although it has merely subjective validity,
it claims the assent of <i>all</i> subjects, exactly as it
would do if it were an objective judgement resting
on grounds of knowledge, that could be established
by a proof.</p>
<h5 id="s34">§ 34. <i>There is no objective principle of Taste
possible</i></h5>
<p>By a principle of taste I mean a principle under
the condition of which we could subsume the concept
of an object and thus infer by means of a
syllogism that the object is beautiful. But that is
absolutely impossible. For I must feel the pleasure
immediately in the representation of the object,
and of that I can be persuaded by no grounds of
proof whatever. Although, as <i>Hume</i> says,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68" id="FNanchor_68">68</a> all critics
can reason more plausibly than cooks, yet the same
fate awaits them. They cannot expect the determining
ground of their judgement [to be derived]
from the force of the proofs, but only from the
reflection of the subject upon its own proper state
(of pleasure or pain), all precepts and rules being
rejected.</p>
<p>But although critics can and ought to pursue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
their reasonings so that our judgements of taste may
be corrected and extended, it is not with a view to
set forth the determining ground of this kind of
aesthetical judgements in a universally applicable
formula, which is impossible; but rather to investigate
the cognitive faculties and their exercise in
these judgements, and to explain by examples the
reciprocal subjective purposiveness, the form of
which, as has been shown above, in a given representation,
constitutes the beauty of the object.
Therefore the Critique of Taste is only subjective
as regards the representation through which an
Object is given to us; viz. it is the art or
science of reducing to rules the reciprocal relation
between the Understanding and the Imagination
in the given representation (without reference to
any preceding sensation or concept). That is, it
is the art or science of reducing to rules their accordance
or discordance, and of determining them with
regard to their conditions. It is an <i>art</i>, if it only
shows this by examples; it is a <i>science</i> if it derives
the possibility of such judgements from the nature
of these faculties, as cognitive faculties in general.
We have here, in Transcendental Criticism, only to do
with the latter. It should develop and justify the
subjective principle of taste, as an <i>a priori</i> principle
of the Judgement. This Critique, as an art, merely
seeks to apply, in the judging of objects, the physiological
(here psychological), and therefore empirical
rules, according to which taste actually proceeds
(without taking any account of their possibility);
and it criticises the products of beautiful art just as,
regarded as a science, it criticises the faculty by
which they are judged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s35">§ 35. <i>The principle of Taste is the subjective
principle of Judgement in general</i></h5>
<p>The judgement of taste is distinguished from a
logical judgement in this, that the latter subsumes
a representation under the concept of the Object,
while the former does not subsume it under any
concept; because otherwise the necessary universal
agreement [in these judgements] would be capable
of being enforced by proofs. Nevertheless it is
like the latter in this, that it claims universality and
necessity, though not according to concepts of the
Object, and consequently a merely subjective necessity.
Now, because the concepts in a judgement
constitute its content (what belongs to the cognition
of the Object), but the judgement of taste is not
determinable by concepts, it is based only on the
subjective formal condition of a judgement in general.
The subjective condition of all judgements is the
faculty of Judgement itself. This when used with
reference to a representation by which an object is
given, requires the accordance of two representative
powers: viz. Imagination (for the intuition and
comprehension of the manifold) and Understanding
(for the concept as a representation of the unity of
this comprehension). Now because no concept of
the Object lies here at the basis of the judgement,
it can only consist in the subsumption of the
Imagination itself (in the case of a representation
by which an object is given) under the conditions
that the Understanding requires to pass from intuition
to concepts. That is, because the freedom of the
Imagination consists in the fact that it schematises
without any concept, the judgement of taste must
rest on a mere sensation of the reciprocal activity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the Imagination in its <i>freedom</i> and the Understanding
with its <i>conformity to law</i>. It must therefore
rest on a feeling, which makes us judge the object
by the purposiveness of the representation (by
which an object is given) in respect of the
furtherance of the cognitive faculty in its free play.
Taste, then, as subjective Judgement, contains a
principle of subsumption, not of intuitions under
concepts, but of the <i>faculty</i> of intuitions or presentations
(<i>i.e.</i> the Imagination) under the <i>faculty</i>
of the concepts (<i>i.e.</i> the Understanding); so far as
the former <i>in its freedom</i> harmonises with the latter
<i>in its conformity to law</i>.</p>
<p>In order to discover this ground of legitimacy
by a Deduction of the judgements of taste we can
only take as a clue the formal peculiarities of this
kind of judgements, and consequently can only consider
their logical form.</p>
<h5 id="s36">§ 36. <i>Of the problem of a Deduction of judgements
of Taste</i></h5>
<p>The concept of an Object in general can immediately
be combined with the perception of an
object, containing its empirical predicates, so as
to form a cognitive judgement; and it is thus that a
judgement of experience is produced.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69" id="FNanchor_69">69</a> At the basis
of this lie <i>a priori</i> concepts of the synthetical
unity of the manifold of intuition, by which the
manifold is thought as the determination of an
Object. These concepts (the Categories) require a
Deduction, which is given in the Critique of pure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Reason; and by it we can get the solution of the
problem, how are synthetical <i>a priori</i> cognitive
judgements possible? This problem concerns then
the <i>a priori</i> principles of the pure Understanding
and its theoretical judgements.</p>
<p>But with a perception there can also be combined
a feeling of pleasure (or pain) and a satisfaction,
that accompanies the representation of the
Object and serves instead of its predicate; thus
there can result an aesthetical non-cognitive judgement.
At the basis of such a judgement—if it is
not a mere judgement of sensation but a formal
judgement of reflection, which imputes the same
satisfaction necessarily to every one,—must lie some
<i>a priori</i> principle; which may be merely subjective
(if an objective one should prove impossible for
judgements of this kind), but also as such may
need a Deduction, that we may thereby comprehend
how an aesthetical judgement can lay claim to
necessity. On this is founded the problem with
which we are now occupied, how are judgements of
taste possible? This problem then has to do with
the <i>a priori</i> principles of the pure faculty of Judgement
in <i>aesthetical</i> judgements; <i>i.e.</i> judgements in
which it has not (as in theoretical ones) merely to
subsume under objective concepts of Understanding,
and in which it is subject to a law, but in which it
is, itself, subjectively, both object and law.</p>
<p>This problem then may be thus represented:
how is a judgement possible, in which merely from
<i>our own</i> feeling of pleasure in an object, independently
of its concept, we judge that this pleasure
attaches to the representation of the same Object
<i>in every other subject</i>, and that <i>a priori</i> without
waiting for the accordance of others?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
It is easy to see that judgements of taste are
synthetical, because they go beyond the concept
and even beyond the intuition of the Object, and
add to that intuition as predicate something that is
not a cognition, viz. a feeling of pleasure (or pain).
Although the predicate (of the <i>personal</i> pleasure
bound up with the representation) is empirical, nevertheless,
as concerns the required assent of <i>every one</i>
the judgements are <i>a priori</i>, or desire to be regarded
as such; and this is already involved in the
expressions of this claim. Thus this problem of the
Critique of Judgement belongs to the general
problem of transcendental philosophy, how are synthetical
<i>a priori</i> judgements possible?</p>
<h5 id="s37">§ 37. <i>What is properly asserted a priori of an
object in a judgement of Taste</i></h5>
<p>That the representation of an object is immediately
bound up with pleasure can only be internally
perceived, and if we did not wish to indicate
anything more than this it would give a merely
empirical judgement. For I cannot combine a
definite feeling (of pleasure or pain) with any
representation except where there is at bottom an
<i>a priori</i> principle in the Reason determining the
Will. In that case the pleasure (in the moral
feeling) is the consequence of the principle, but
cannot be compared with the pleasure in taste,
because it requires a definite concept of a law; and
the latter pleasure, on the contrary, must be
bound up with the mere act of judging, prior
to all concepts. Hence also all judgements of
taste are singular judgements, because they do
not combine their predicate of satisfaction with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
concept, but with a given individual empirical representation.</p>
<p>And so it is not the pleasure, but the <i>universal
validity of this pleasure</i>, perceived as mentally
bound up with the mere judgement upon an object,
which is represented <i>a priori</i> in a judgement of
taste as a universal rule for the Judgement and valid
for every one. It is an empirical judgement [to say]
that I perceive and judge an object with pleasure.
But it is an <i>a priori</i> judgement [to say] that I find it
beautiful, <i>i.e.</i> I attribute this satisfaction necessarily
to every one.</p>
<h5 id="s38">§ 38. <i>Deduction of judgements of Taste</i></h5>
<p>If it be admitted that in a pure judgement of
taste the satisfaction in the object is combined with
the mere act of judging its form, it is nothing else
than its subjective purposiveness for the Judgement
which we feel to be mentally combined with the
representation of the object. The Judgement, as
regards the formal rules of its action, apart from all
matter (whether sensation or concept), can only be
directed to the subjective conditions of its employment
in general (it is applied<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70" id="FNanchor_70">70</a> neither to a particular
mode of sense nor to a particular concept of the
Understanding); and consequently to that subjective
[element] which we can presuppose in all men (as
requisite for possible cognition in general). Thus
the agreement of a representation with these conditions
of the Judgement must be capable of being
assumed as valid <i>a priori</i> for every one. <i>I.e.</i> we
may rightly impute to every one the pleasure or the
subjective purposiveness of the representation for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the relation between the cognitive faculties in the
act of judging a sensible object in general.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71" id="FNanchor_71">71</a></p>
<h6><i>Remark</i></h6>
<p>This Deduction is thus easy, because it has no
need to justify the objective reality of any concept,
for Beauty is not a concept of the Object and the
judgement of taste is not cognitive. It only maintains
that we are justified in presupposing universally
in every man those subjective conditions of the
Judgement which we find in ourselves; and further,
that we have rightly subsumed the given Object
under these conditions. The latter has indeed
unavoidable difficulties which do not beset the
logical Judgement. There we subsume under concepts,
but in the aesthetical Judgement under a
merely sensible relation between the Imagination
and Understanding mutually harmonising in the
representation of the form of the Object,—in which
case the subsumption may easily be fallacious. Yet
the legitimacy of the claim of the Judgement in
counting upon universal assent is not thus annulled;
it reduces itself merely to the correctness of the
principle of judging validly for every one from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
subjective grounds. For as to the difficulty or
doubt concerning the correctness of the subsumption
under that principle, it makes the legitimacy of the
claim of an aesthetical judgement in general to such
validity and the principle of the same, as little
doubtful, as the like faulty (though neither so
commonly nor readily faulty) subsumption of the
logical Judgement under its principle can make the
latter, an objective principle, doubtful. But if the
question were to be, how is it possible to assume
nature <i>a priori</i> to be a complex of objects of taste?
this problem has reference to Teleology, because it
must be regarded as a purpose of nature essentially
belonging to its concept to exhibit forms that are
purposive for our Judgement. But the correctness
of this latter assumption is very doubtful, whereas
the efficacy of natural beauties is patent to experience.</p>
<h5 id="s39">§ 39. <i>Of the communicability of a Sensation</i></h5>
<p>If sensation, as the real in perception, is related
to knowledge, it is called sensation of the senses;
and its specific quality may be represented as generally
communicable in a uniform way, if we assume
that every one has senses like our own. But this
cannot at all be presupposed of any single sensation.
To a man who is deficient in the sense of smell,
this kind of sensation cannot be communicated;
and even if it is not wholly deficient, we cannot
be certain that he gets exactly the same sensation
from a flower that we have. But even more must
we represent men as differing in respect of the
<i>pleasantness</i> or <i>unpleasantness</i> involved in the sensation
from the same object of sense; and it is
absolutely not to be required that every man should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
take pleasure in the same objects. Pleasure of this
kind, because it comes into the mind through the
senses, in respect of which therefore we are passive,
we may call the pleasure of <i>enjoyment</i>.</p>
<p>Satisfaction in an action because of its moral
character is on the other hand not the pleasure of
enjoyment, but of spontaneity and its accordance
with the Idea of its destination. But this feeling,
called moral, requires concepts, and presents not free
purposiveness, but purposiveness that is conformable
to law; it therefore admits of being universally
communicated only by means of Reason, and, if the
pleasure is to be homogeneous for every one, by
very definite practical concepts of Reason.</p>
<p>Pleasure in the Sublime in nature, regarded as
a pleasure of rational contemplation, also makes
claim to universal participation; but it presupposes,
besides, a different feeling, viz. that of our supersensible
destination, which, however obscurely, has
a moral foundation. But that other men will take
account of it, and will find a satisfaction in the consideration
of the wild greatness of nature (that
certainly cannot be ascribed to its aspect, which is
rather terrifying), I am not absolutely justified in
supposing. Nevertheless, in consideration of the
fact that on every suitable occasion regard should be
had to these moral dispositions, I can impute such
satisfaction to every man, but only by means of the
moral law which on its side again is based on
concepts of Reason.</p>
<p>On the contrary, pleasure in the Beautiful is
neither a pleasure of enjoyment nor of a law-abiding
activity, nor even of rational contemplation in
accordance with Ideas, but of mere reflection. Without
having as rule any purpose or fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
proposition, this pleasure accompanies the ordinary
apprehension of an object by the Imagination, as
faculty of intuition, in relation with the Understanding,
as faculty of concepts, by means of a procedure
of the Judgement which it must also exercise on
behalf of the commonest experience; only that in
the latter case it is in order to perceive an empirical
objective concept, in the former case (in aesthetical
judgements) merely to perceive the accordance of the
representation with the harmonious (subjectively
purposive) activity of both cognitive faculties in their
freedom, <i>i.e.</i> to feel with pleasure the mental state
produced by the representation. This pleasure
must necessarily depend for every one on the same
conditions, for they are subjective conditions of the
possibility of a cognition in general; and the proportion
between these cognitive faculties requisite
for Taste is also requisite for that ordinary sound
Understanding which we have to presuppose in
every one. Therefore he who judges with taste (if
only he does not go astray in this act of consciousness
and mistake matter for form or charm for
beauty) may impute to every one subjective purposiveness,
<i>i.e.</i> his satisfaction in the Object, and may
assume his feeling to be universally communicable
and that without the mediation of concepts.</p>
<h5 id="s40">§ 40. <i>Of Taste as a kind of</i> sensus communis</h5>
<p>We often give to the Judgement, if we are considering
the result rather than the act of its reflection,
the name of a sense, and we speak of a sense of
truth, or of a sense of decorum, of justice, etc. And
yet we know, or at least we ought to know, that
these concepts cannot have their place in Sense, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
further, that Sense has not the least capacity for
expressing universal rules; but that no representation
of truth, fitness, beauty, or justice, and so forth,
could come into our thoughts if we could not rise
beyond Sense to higher faculties of cognition. <i>The
common Understanding of men</i>, which, as the mere
sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard
as the least to be expected from any one claiming the
name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of
being given the name of common sense (<i>sensus communis</i>);
and in such a way that by the name
<i>common</i> (not merely in our language, where the word
actually has a double signification, but in many
others) we understand <i>vulgar</i>, that which is everywhere
met with, the possession of which indicates
absolutely no merit or superiority.</p>
<p>But under the <i>sensus communis</i> we must include
the Idea of a <i>communal</i> sense, <i>i.e.</i> of a faculty of
judgement, which in its reflection takes account
(<i>a priori</i>) of the mode of representation of all other
men in thought; in order <i>as it were</i> to compare its
judgement with the collective Reason of humanity,
and thus to escape the illusion arising from the
private conditions that could be so easily taken for
objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.
This is done by comparing our judgement
with the possible rather than the actual judgements
of others, and by putting ourselves in the place of
any other man, by abstracting from the limitations
which contingently attach to our own judgement.
This, again, is brought about by leaving aside as
much as possible the matter of our representative
state, <i>i.e.</i> sensation, and simply having respect to
the formal peculiarities of our representation or
representative state. Now this operation of reflection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
seems perhaps too artificial to be attributed
to the faculty called <i>common</i> sense; but it only
appears so, when expressed in abstract formulae.
In itself there is nothing more natural than to
abstract from charm or emotion if we are seeking a
judgement that is to serve as a universal rule.</p>
<p>The following Maxims of common human Understanding
do not properly come in here, as parts of
the Critique of Taste; but yet they may serve to
elucidate its fundamental propositions. They are:
1° to think for oneself; 2° to put ourselves in thought
in the place of every one else; 3° always to think
consistently. The first is the maxim of <i>unprejudiced</i>
thought; the second of <i>enlarged</i> thought; the third
of <i>consecutive</i> thought.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_72" id="FNanchor_72">72</a> The first is the maxim of
a Reason never <i>passive</i>. The tendency to such
passivity, and therefore to heteronomy of the
Reason, is called <i>prejudice</i>; and the greatest prejudice
of all is to represent nature as not subject
to the rules that the Understanding places at its
basis by means of its own essential law, <i>i.e.</i> is
<i>superstition</i>. Deliverance from superstition is called
<i>enlightenment</i>;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73" id="FNanchor_73">73</a> because although this name belongs
to deliverance from prejudices in general,
yet superstition specially (<i>in sensu eminenti</i>) deserves
to be called a prejudice. For the blindness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
in which superstition places us, which it even imposes
on us as an obligation, makes the need of
being guided by others, and the consequent passive
state of our Reason, peculiarly noticeable. As
regards the second maxim of the mind, we are
otherwise wont to call him limited (<i>borné</i>, the
opposite of <i>enlarged</i>) whose talents attain to no
great use (especially as regards intensity). But
here we are not speaking of the faculty of cognition,
but of the <i>mode of thought</i> which makes a purposive
use thereof. However small may be the area or the
degree to which a man’s natural gifts reach, yet it
indicates a man of <i>enlarged thought</i> if he disregards
the subjective private conditions of his own judgement,
by which so many others are confined, and
reflects upon it from a <i>universal standpoint</i> (which
he can only determine by placing himself at the
standpoint of others). The third maxim, viz. that
of <i>consecutive</i> thought, is the most difficult to attain,
and can only be attained by the combination of both
the former, and after the constant observance of
them has grown into a habit. We may say that
the first of these maxims is the maxim of Understanding,
the second of Judgement, and the third of
Reason.</p>
<p>I take up again the threads interrupted by this
digression, and I say that Taste can be called <i>sensus
communis</i> with more justice than sound Understanding
can; and that the aesthetical Judgement
rather than the intellectual may bear the name of a
communal sense,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74" id="FNanchor_74">74</a> if we are willing to use the word
“sense” of an effect of mere reflection upon the
mind: for then we understand by sense the feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of pleasure. We could even define Taste as the
faculty of judging of that which makes <i>universally
communicable</i>, without the mediation of a concept,
our feeling in a given representation.</p>
<p>The skill that men have in communicating their
thoughts requires also a relation between the Imagination
and the Understanding in order to associate
intuitions with concepts, and concepts again with
those concepts, which then combine in a cognition.
But in that case the agreement of the two mental
powers is <i>according to law</i>, under the constraint of
definite concepts. Only where the Imagination in
its freedom awakens the Understanding, and is put
by it into regular play without the aid of concepts,
does the representation communicate itself not as a
thought but as an internal feeling of a purposive
state of the mind.</p>
<p>Taste is then the faculty of judging <i>a priori</i> of
the communicability of feelings that are bound up
with a given representation (without the mediation
of a concept).</p>
<p>If we could assume that the mere universal
communicability of a feeling must carry in itself an
interest for us with it (which, however, we are not
justified in concluding from the character of a
merely reflective Judgement), we should be able
to explain why the feeling in the judgement of taste
comes to be imputed to every one, so to speak, as
a duty.</p>
<h5 id="s41">§ 41. <i>Of the empirical interest in the Beautiful</i></h5>
<p>That the judgement of taste by which something
is declared beautiful must have no interest <i>as its
determining ground</i> has been sufficiently established
above. But it does not follow that after it has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
given as a pure aesthetical judgement, no interest can
be combined with it. This combination, however,
can only be indirect, <i>i.e.</i> taste must first of all be
represented as combined with something else, in
order that we may unite with the satisfaction of
mere reflection upon an object a <i>pleasure in its
existence</i> (as that wherein all interest consists). For
here also in aesthetical judgements what we say in
cognitive judgements (of things in general) is valid;
<i>a posse ad esse non valet consequentia</i>. This
something else may be empirical, viz. an inclination
proper to human nature, or intellectual, as the
property of the Will of being capable of <i>a priori</i>
determination by Reason. Both these involve a
satisfaction in the presence of an Object, and so can
lay the foundation for an interest in what has by
itself pleased without reference to any interest
whatever.</p>
<p>Empirically the Beautiful interests only in
<i>society</i>. If we admit the impulse to society as natural
to man, and his fitness for it, and his propension
towards it, <i>i.e.</i> <i>sociability</i>, as a requisite for man as
a being destined for society, and so as a property
belonging to <i>humanity</i>, we cannot escape from
regarding taste as a faculty for judging everything
in respect of which we can communicate
our <i>feeling</i> to all other men, and so as a means of
furthering that which every one’s natural inclination
desires.</p>
<p>A man abandoned by himself on a desert island
would adorn neither his hut nor his person; nor
would he seek for flowers, still less would he plant
them, in order to adorn himself therewith. It is
only in society that it occurs to him to be not merely
a man, but a refined man after his kind (the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
of civilisation). For such do we judge him
to be who is both inclined and apt to communicate
his pleasure to others, and who is not contented
with an Object if he cannot feel satisfaction in it in
common with others. Again, every one expects and
requires from every one else this reference to universal
communication [of pleasure], as it were from an
original compact dictated by humanity itself. Thus,
doubtless, in the beginning only those things which
attracted the senses, <i>e.g.</i> colours for painting
oneself (roucou among the Carabs and cinnabar
among the Iroquois), flowers, mussel shells,
beautiful feathers, etc.,—but in time beautiful forms
also (<i>e.g.</i> in their canoes, and clothes, etc.), which
bring with them no gratification, or satisfaction of
enjoyment—were important in society, and were
combined with great interest. Until at last
civilisation, having reached its highest point, makes
out of this almost the main business of refined inclination;
and sensations are only regarded as of
worth in so far as they can be universally communicated.
Here, although the pleasure which every
one has in such an object is inconsiderable and in
itself without any marked interest, yet the Idea of
its universal communicability increases its worth in
an almost infinite degree.</p>
<p>But this interest that indirectly attaches to the
Beautiful through our inclination to society, and
consequently is empirical, is of no importance for us
here; because we have only to look to what may
have a reference, although only indirectly, to the
judgement of taste <i>a priori</i>. For if even in this
form an interest bound up therewith should discover
itself, taste would discover a transition of our judging
faculty from sense-enjoyment to moral feeling;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and so not only would we be the better guided in
employing taste purposively, but there would be
thus presented a link in the chain of the human
faculties <i>a priori</i>, on which all legislation must
depend. We can only say thus much about the
empirical interest in objects of taste and in taste
itself. Since it is subservient to inclination, however
refined the latter may be, it may easily be
confounded with all the inclinations and passions,
which attain their greatest variety and highest
degree in society; and the interest in the Beautiful,
if it is grounded thereon, can only furnish a very
ambiguous transition from the Pleasant to the Good.
But whether this can or cannot be furthered by
taste, taken in its purity, is what we now have to
investigate.</p>
<h5 id="s42">§ 42. <i>Of the intellectual interest in the Beautiful</i></h5>
<p>With the best intentions those persons who
refer all activities, to which their inner natural
dispositions impel men, to the final purpose of
humanity, viz. the morally good, have regarded the
taking an interest in the Beautiful in general as a
mark of good moral character. But it is not without
reason that they have been contradicted by
others who rely on experience; for this shows that
connoisseurs in taste, not only often but generally,
are given up to idle, capricious, and mischievous
passions, and that they could perhaps make less
claim than others to any pre-eminent attachment
to moral principles. Thus it would seem that the
feeling for the Beautiful is not only (as actually is
the case) specifically different from the Moral feeling;
but that the interest which can be bound up with it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
is hardly compatible with moral interest, and
certainly has no inner affinity therewith.</p>
<p>Now I admit at once that the interest in the
<i>Beautiful of Art</i> (under which I include the
artificial use of natural beauties for adornment and
so for vanity) furnishes no proof whatever of a
disposition attached to the morally good or even
inclined thereto. But on the other hand, I maintain
that to take an <i>immediate interest</i> in the Beauty of
Nature (not merely to have taste in judging it) is
always a mark of a good soul; and that when this
interest is habitual it at least indicates a frame of
mind favourable to the moral feeling, if it is voluntarily
bound up with the <i>contemplation of nature</i>.
It is to be remembered, however, that I here speak
strictly of the beautiful <i>forms</i> of Nature, and I set
aside the <i>charms</i>, that she is wont to combine so
abundantly with them; because, though the interest
in the latter is indeed immediate, it is only empirical.</p>
<p>He who by himself (and without any design of
communicating his observations to others) regards
the beautiful figure of a wild flower, a bird, an
insect, etc., with admiration and love—who would
not willingly miss it in Nature, although it may
bring him some hurt, who still less wants any
advantage from it—<i>he</i> takes an immediate and also
an intellectual interest in the beauty of Nature.
<i>I.e.</i> it is not merely the form of the product of
nature which pleases him, but its very presence
pleases him, the charms of sense having no share
in this pleasure and no purpose whatever being
combined with it.</p>
<p>But it is noteworthy that if we secretly deceived
this lover of the beautiful by planting in the ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
artificial flowers (which can be manufactured exactly
like natural ones), or by placing artificially carved
birds on the boughs of trees, and he discovered the
deceit, the immediate interest that he previously took
in them would disappear at once; though, perhaps,
a different interest, viz. the interest of vanity in
adorning his chamber with them for the eyes of
others, would take its place. This thought then
must accompany our intuition and reflection on
beauty, viz. that nature has produced it; and on
this alone is based the immediate interest that
we take in it. Otherwise, there remains a mere
judgement of taste, either devoid of all interest,
or bound up with a mediate interest, viz. in that
it has reference to society; which latter [interest]
furnishes no certain indications of a morally good
disposition.</p>
<p>This superiority of natural to artificial beauty
in that it alone arouses an immediate interest,
although as regards form the first may be surpassed
by the second, harmonises with the refined and
well-grounded habit of thought of all men who have
cultivated their moral feeling. If a man who has
taste enough to judge of the products of beautiful
Art with the greatest accuracy and refinement
willingly leaves a chamber where are to be found
those beauties that minister to vanity or to any
social joys, and turns to the beautiful in Nature
in order to find, as it were, delight for his spirit
in a train of thought that he can never completely
evolve, we will regard this choice of his with veneration,
and attribute to him a beautiful soul, to which
no connoisseur or lover [of Art] can lay claim on
account of the interest he takes in his [artistic]
objects.—What now is the difference in our estimation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of these two different kinds of Objects, which
in the judgement of mere taste it is hard to compare
in point of superiority?</p>
<p>We have a faculty of mere aesthetical Judgement
by which we judge forms without the aid of concepts,
and find a satisfaction in this mere act of judgement;
this we make into a rule for every one, without this
judgement either being based on or producing any
interest.—On the other hand, we have also a
faculty of intellectual Judgement which determines
an <i>a priori</i> satisfaction for the mere forms of
practical maxims (so far as they are in themselves
qualified for universal legislation); this we make
into a law for every one, without our judgement
being based on any interest whatever, <i>though in this
case it produces such an interest</i>. The pleasure or
pain in the former judgement is called that of taste,
in the latter, that of moral feeling.</p>
<p>But it also interests Reason that the Ideas (for
which in moral feeling it arouses an immediate
interest) should have objective reality; <i>i.e.</i> that
nature should at least show a trace or give an
indication that it contains in itself some ground for
assuming a regular agreement of its products with
our entirely disinterested satisfaction (which we
recognise <i>a priori</i> as a law for every one, without
being able to base it upon proofs). Hence Reason
must take an interest in every expression on the
part of nature of an agreement of this kind. Consequently,
the mind cannot ponder upon the beauty
of <i>Nature</i> without finding itself at the same time
interested therein. But this interest is akin to
moral, and he who takes such an interest in the
beauties of nature can do so only in so far as he
previously has firmly established his interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
morally good. If, therefore, the beauty of Nature
interests a man immediately we have reason for
attributing to him, at least, a basis for a good moral
disposition.</p>
<p>It will be said that this account of aesthetical
judgements, as akin to the moral feeling, seems far
too studied to be regarded as the true interpretation
of that cipher through which Nature speaks to us
figuratively in her beautiful forms. However, in the
first place, this immediate interest in the beautiful
is actually not common; but is peculiar to those
whose mental disposition either has already been
cultivated in the direction of the good or is eminently
susceptible of such cultivation. In that case
the analogy between the pure judgement of taste
which, independently of any interest, causes us to
feel a satisfaction, and also represents it <i>a priori</i>
as suitable to humanity in general, and the moral
judgement that does the same thing from concepts
without any clear, subtle, and premeditated reflection—this
analogy leads to a similar immediate interest
in the objects of the former as in those of the
latter; only that in the one case the interest is free,
in the other it is based on objective laws. To this
is to be added our admiration for Nature, which
displays itself in its beautiful products as Art, not
merely by chance, but as it were designedly, in
accordance with a regular arrangement, and as
purposiveness without purpose. This latter, as we
never meet with it outside ourselves, we naturally
seek in ourselves; and, in fact, in that which
constitutes the ultimate purpose of our being, viz.
our moral destination. (Of this question as to the
ground of the possibility of such natural purposiveness
we shall first speak in the Teleology.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
It is easy to explain why the satisfaction in the
pure aesthetical judgement in the case of beautiful
Art is not combined with an immediate interest as
it is in the case of beautiful Nature. For the former
is either such an imitation of the latter that it reaches
the point of deception and then produces the same
effect as natural beauty (for which it is taken); or
it is an art obviously directed designedly to our
satisfaction. In the latter case the satisfaction in the
product would, it is true, be brought about immediately
by taste, but it would be only a mediate interest
in the cause lying at its root, viz. an art that can
only interest by means of its purpose and never in
itself. It will, perhaps, be said that this is also
the case, if an Object of nature interests us by its
beauty only so far as it is associated with a moral
Idea. But it is not the Object itself which immediately
interests us, but its character in virtue of which
it is qualified for such association, which therefore
essentially belongs to it.</p>
<p>The charms in beautiful Nature, which are so
often found, as it were, blended with beautiful forms,
may be referred to modifications either of light
(colours) or of sound (tones). For these are the only
sensations that imply not merely a sensible feeling
but also reflection upon the form of these modifications
of Sense; and thus they involve in themselves
as it were a language by which nature speaks to us,
which thus seems to have a higher sense. Thus the
white colour of lilies seems to determine the mind
to Ideas of innocence; and the seven colours in
order from the red to the violet seem to suggest the
Ideas of (1) Sublimity, (2) Intrepidity, (3) Candour,
(4) Friendliness, (5) Modesty, (6) Constancy, (7)
Tenderness. The song of birds proclaims gladsomeness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
and contentment with existence. At least
so we interpret nature, whether it have this design
or not. But the interest which we here take in
beauty has only to do with the beauty of Nature;
it vanishes altogether as soon as we notice that we
are deceived and that it is only Art—vanishes so
completely that taste can no longer find the thing
beautiful or sight find it charming. What is more
highly praised by poets than the bewitching and
beautiful note of the nightingale in a lonely copse
on a still summer evening by the soft light of the
moon? And yet we have instances of a merry host,
where no such songster was to be found, deceiving
to their great contentment the guests who were
staying with him to enjoy the country air, by hiding
in a bush a mischievous boy who knew how to
produce this sound exactly like nature (by means of
a reed or a tube in his mouth). But as soon as we
are aware that it is a cheat, no one will remain long
listening to the song which before was counted
so charming. And it is just the same with the
songs of all other birds. It must be Nature or be
regarded as Nature, if we are to take an immediate
<i>interest</i> in the Beautiful as such; and still more is
this the case if we can require that others should
take an interest in it too. This happens as a matter
of fact when we regard as coarse and ignoble the
mental attitude of those persons who have no <i>feeling</i>
for beautiful Nature (for thus we describe a susceptibility
to interest in its contemplation), and who
confine themselves to eating and drinking—to the
mere enjoyments of sense.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s43">§ 43. <i>Of Art in general</i></h5>
<p>(1). <i>Art</i> is distinguished from Nature, as doing
(<i>facere</i>) is distinguished from acting or working
generally (<i>agere</i>), and as the product or result of
the former is distinguished as <i>work</i> (<i>opus</i>) from the
working (<i>effectus</i>) of the latter.</p>
<p>By right we ought only to describe as Art,
production through freedom, <i>i.e.</i> through a will
that places Reason at the basis of its actions.
For although we like to call the product of bees
(regularly built cells of wax) a work of art, this is
only by way of analogy: as soon as we feel that
this work of theirs is based on no proper rational
deliberation, we say that it is a product of Nature
(of instinct), and as Art only ascribe it to their
Creator.</p>
<p>If, as sometimes happens, in searching through a
bog we come upon a bit of shaped wood, we do not
say: this is a product of Nature, but, of Art. Its
producing cause has conceived a purpose to which
the bit of wood owes its form. Elsewhere too we
should see art in everything which is made so that a
representation of it in its cause must have preceded
its actuality (as even in the case of the bees), though
the effect could not have been <i>thought</i> by the cause.
But if we call anything absolutely a work of art in
order to distinguish it from a natural effect, we
always understand by that a work of man.</p>
<p>(2). <i>Art</i> regarded as human skill differs from
<i>science</i> (as <i>can</i> from <i>know</i>) as a practical faculty does
from a theoretical, as Technic does from Theory (as
mensuration from geometry). And so what we <i>can</i>
do, as soon as we merely <i>know</i> what ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
done and therefore are sufficiently cognisant of the
desired effect, is not called Art. Only that which
a man, even if he knows it completely, may not
therefore have the skill to accomplish, belongs to
Art. <i>Camper</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75" id="FNanchor_75">75</a> describes very exactly how the best
shoes must be made, but he certainly could not
make one.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76" id="FNanchor_76">76</a></p>
<p>(3). <i>Art</i> also differs from <i>handicraft</i>; the first is
called <i>free</i>, the other may be called mercenary. We
regard the first as if it could only prove purposive
as play, <i>i.e.</i> as occupation that is pleasant in itself.
But the second is regarded as if it could only be
compulsorily imposed upon one as work, <i>i.e.</i> as
occupation which is unpleasant (a trouble) in itself,
and which is only attractive on account of its effect
(<i>e.g.</i> the wage). Whether or not in the graded list
of the professions we ought to count watchmakers
as artists, but smiths only as handicraftsmen, would
require another point of view from which to judge
than that which we are here taking up; viz. [we
should have to consider] the proportion of talents
which must be assumed requisite in these several
occupations. Whether or not, again, under the so-called
seven free arts some may be included which
ought to be classed as sciences, and many that are
akin rather to handicraft, I shall not here discuss.
But it is not inexpedient to recall that in all free
arts there is yet requisite something compulsory,
or, as it is called, <i>mechanism</i>, without which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<i>spirit</i>, which must be free in art and which alone
inspires the work, would have no body and would
evaporate altogether; <i>e.g.</i> in poetry there must be
an accuracy and wealth of language, and also
prosody and metre. [It is not inexpedient, I say,
to recall this], for many modern educators believe
that the best way to produce a free art is to remove
it from all constraint, and thus to change it from
work into mere play.</p>
<h5 id="s44">§ 44. <i>Of beautiful Art</i></h5>
<p>There is no Science of the Beautiful, but only
a Critique of it; and there is no such thing as
beautiful Science, but only beautiful Art. For as
regards the first point, if it could be decided
scientifically, <i>i.e.</i> by proofs, whether a thing was to
be regarded as beautiful or not, the judgement
upon beauty would belong to science and would
not be a judgement of taste. And as far as the
second point is concerned, a science which should
be beautiful as such is a nonentity. For if in such
a science we were to ask for grounds and proofs,
we would be put off with tasteful phrases (bon-mots).—The
source of the common expression,
<i>beautiful science</i>, is without doubt nothing else than
this, as it has been rightly remarked, that for
beautiful art in its entire completeness much science
is requisite; <i>e.g.</i> a knowledge of ancient languages,
a learned familiarity with classical authors, history,
a knowledge of antiquities, etc. And hence these
historical sciences, because they form the necessary
preparation and basis for beautiful art, and also
partly because under them is included the knowledge
of the products of beautiful art (rhetoric and poetry),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
have come to be called beautiful sciences by a
confusion of words.</p>
<p>If art which is adequate to the <i>cognition</i> of a
possible object performs the actions requisite therefore
merely in order to make it actual, it is <i>mechanical</i>
art; but if it has for its immediate design the feeling
of pleasure, it is called <i>aesthetical</i> art. This is
again either <i>pleasant</i> or <i>beautiful</i>. It is the first, if
its purpose is that the pleasure should accompany
the representations [of the object] regarded as mere
<i>sensations</i>; it is the second if they are regarded as
<i>modes of cognition</i>.</p>
<p>Pleasant arts are those that are directed merely
to enjoyment. Of this class are all those charming
arts that can gratify a company at table; <i>e.g.</i> the
art of telling stories in an entertaining way, of starting
the company in frank and lively conversation, of
raising them by jest and laugh to a certain pitch of
merriment;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77" id="FNanchor_77">77</a> when, as people say, there may be a
great deal of gossip at the feast, but no one will be
answerable for what he says, because they are only
concerned with momentary entertainment, and not
with any permanent material for reflection or subsequent
discussion. (Among these are also to be
reckoned the way of arranging the table for enjoyment,
and, at great feasts, the management of the
music. This latter is a wonderful thing. It is
meant to dispose to gaiety the minds of the guests,
regarded solely as a pleasant noise, without any
one paying the least attention to its composition;
and it favours the free conversation of each with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
neighbour.) Again, to this class belong all games
which bring with them no further interest than that
of making the time pass imperceptibly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, beautiful art is a mode of
representation which is purposive for itself, and
which, although devoid of [definite] purpose, yet
furthers the culture of the mental powers in reference
to social communication.</p>
<p>The universal communicability of a pleasure
carries with it in its very concept that the pleasure
is not one of enjoyment, from mere sensation, but
must be derived from reflection; and thus aesthetical
art, as the art of beauty, has for standard the
reflective Judgement and not sensation.</p>
<h5 id="s45">§ 45. <i>Beautiful Art is an art, in so far as it seems
like nature</i></h5>
<p>In a product of beautiful art we must become
conscious that it is Art and not Nature; but yet the
purposiveness in its form must seem to be as free
from all constraint of arbitrary rules as if it were a
product of mere nature. On this feeling of freedom
in the play of our cognitive faculties, which must
at the same time be purposive, rests that pleasure
which alone is universally communicable, without
being based on concepts. Nature is beautiful
because it looks like Art; and Art can only be
called beautiful if we are conscious of it as Art
while yet it looks like Nature.</p>
<p>For whether we are dealing with natural or
with artificial beauty we can say generally: <i>That is
beautiful which pleases in the mere act of judging it</i>
(not in the sensation of it, or by means of a concept).
Now art has always a definite design of producing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
something. But if this something were bare sensation
(something merely subjective), which is to be
accompanied with pleasure, the product would please
in the act of judgement only by mediation of sensible
feeling. And again, if the design were directed
towards the production of a definite Object, then,
if this were attained by art, the Object would only
please by means of concepts. But in both cases the
art would not please <i>in the mere act of judging</i>; <i>i.e.</i>
it would not please as beautiful, but as mechanical.</p>
<p>Hence the purposiveness in the product of beautiful
art, although it is designed, must not seem
to be designed; <i>i.e.</i> beautiful art must <i>look</i> like
nature, although we are conscious of it as art.
But a product of art appears like nature when,
although its agreement with the rules, according to
which alone the product can become what it ought
to be, is <i>punctiliously</i> observed, yet this is not <i>painfully</i>
apparent; [the form of the schools does not
obtrude itself]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_78" id="FNanchor_78">78</a>—it shows no trace of the rule
having been before the eyes of the artist and having
fettered his mental powers.</p>
<h5 id="s46">§ 46. <i>Beautiful Art is the art of genius</i></h5>
<p><i>Genius</i> is the talent (or natural gift) which gives
the rule to Art. Since talent, as the innate productive
faculty of the artist, belongs itself to Nature,
we may express the matter thus: <i>Genius</i> is the
innate mental disposition (<i>ingenium</i>) <i>through which</i>
Nature gives the rule to Art.</p>
<p>Whatever may be thought of this definition,
whether it is merely arbitrary or whether it is
adequate to the concept that we are accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
combine with the word <i>genius</i> (which is to be
examined in the following paragraphs), we can
prove already beforehand that according to the
signification of the word here adopted, beautiful
arts must necessarily be considered as arts of <i>genius</i>.</p>
<p>For every art presupposes rules by means of
which in the first instance a product, if it is to be
called artistic, is represented as possible. But the
concept of beautiful art does not permit the
judgement upon the beauty of a product to be
derived from any rule, which has a <i>concept</i> as its
determining ground, and therefore has at its basis a
concept of the way in which the product is possible.
Therefore, beautiful art cannot itself devise the rule
according to which it can bring about its product.
But since at the same time a product can never be
called Art without some precedent rule, Nature in
the subject must (by the harmony of its faculties)
give the rule to Art; <i>i.e.</i> beautiful Art is only possible
as a product of Genius.</p>
<p>We thus see (1) that genius is a <i>talent</i> for
producing that for which no definite rule can be
given; it is not a mere aptitude for what can be
learnt by a rule. Hence <i>originality</i> must be its
first property. (2) But since it also can produce
original nonsense, its products must be models, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>exemplary</i>; and they consequently ought not to
spring from imitation, but must serve as a standard
or rule of judgement for others. (3) It cannot
describe or indicate scientifically how it brings about
its products, but it gives the rule just as nature
does. Hence the author of a product for which he
is indebted to his genius does not himself know
how he has come by his Ideas; and he has not the
power to devise the like at pleasure or in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
with a plan, and to communicate it to others in
precepts that will enable them to produce similar
products. (Hence it is probable that the word
genius is derived from <i>genius</i>, that peculiar guiding
and guardian spirit given to a man at his birth, from
whose suggestion these original Ideas proceed.)
(4) Nature by the medium of genius does not
prescribe rules to Science, but to Art; and to it
only in so far as it is to be beautiful Art.</p>
<h5 id="s47">§ 47. <i>Elucidation and confirmation of the above
explanation of Genius</i></h5>
<p>Every one is agreed that genius is entirely
opposed to the <i>spirit of imitation</i>. Now since
learning is nothing but imitation, it follows that
the greatest ability and teachableness (capacity)
regarded <i>quâ</i> teachableness, cannot avail for genius.
Even if a man thinks or invents for himself, and
does not merely take in what others have taught,
even if he discovers many things in art and science,
this is not the right ground for calling such a
(perhaps great) <i>head</i>, a genius (as opposed to him
who because he can only learn and imitate is called
a <i>shallow-pate</i>). For even these things could be
learned, they lie in the natural path of him who
investigates and reflects according to rules; and
they do not differ specifically from what can be
acquired by industry through imitation. Thus we
can readily learn all that <i>Newton</i> has set forth in
his immortal work on the Principles of Natural
Philosophy, however great a head was required to
discover it; but we cannot learn to write spirited
poetry, however express may be the precepts of the
art and however excellent its models. The reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
is that <i>Newton</i> could make all his steps, from the
first elements of geometry to his own great and
profound discoveries, intuitively plain and definite
as regards consequence, not only to himself but to
every one else. But a <i>Homer</i> or a <i>Wieland</i> cannot
show how his Ideas, so rich in fancy and yet so full
of thought, come together in his head, simply
because he does not know and therefore cannot
teach others. In Science then the greatest discoverer
only differs in degree from his laborious
imitator and pupil; but he differs specifically from
him whom Nature has gifted for beautiful Art.
And in this there is no depreciation of those great
men to whom the human race owes so much
gratitude, as compared with nature’s favourites in
respect of the talent for beautiful art. For in the
fact that the former talent is directed to the ever-advancing
greater perfection of knowledge and
every advantage depending on it, and at the same
time to the imparting this same knowledge to
others—in this it has a great superiority over [the
talent of] those who deserve the honour of being
called geniuses. For art stands still at a certain
point; a boundary is set to it beyond which it
cannot go, which presumably has been reached long
ago and cannot be extended further. Again,
artistic skill cannot be communicated; it is imparted
to every artist immediately by the hand of nature;
and so it dies with him, until nature endows another
in the same way, so that he only needs an example
in order to put in operation in a similar fashion the
talent of which he is conscious.</p>
<p>If now it is a natural gift which must prescribe
its rule to art (as beautiful art), of what kind is this
rule? It cannot be reduced to a formula and serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
as a precept, for then the judgement upon the
beautiful would be determinable according to
concepts; but the rule must be abstracted from the
fact, <i>i.e.</i> from the product, on which others may try
their own talent by using it as a model, not to be
<i>copied</i> but to be <i>imitated</i>. How this is possible is
hard to explain. The Ideas of the artist excite like
Ideas in his pupils if nature has endowed them with
a like proportion of their mental powers. Hence
models of beautiful art are the only means of
handing down these Ideas to posterity. This
cannot be done by mere descriptions, especially not
in the case of the arts of speech, and in this latter
classical models are only to be had in the old dead
languages, now preserved only as “the learned
languages.”</p>
<p>Although mechanical and beautiful art are very
different, the first being a mere art of industry and
learning and the second of genius, yet there is no
beautiful art in which there is not a mechanical
element that can be comprehended by rules and
followed accordingly, and in which therefore there
must be something <i>scholastic</i> as an essential
condition. For [in every art] some purpose must
be conceived; otherwise we could not ascribe the
product to art at all, and it would be a mere
product of chance. But in order to accomplish a
purpose, definite rules from which we cannot dispense
ourselves are requisite. Now since the originality
of the talent constitutes an essential (though not the
only) element in the character of genius, shallow
heads believe that they cannot better show themselves
to be full-blown geniuses than by throwing
off the constraint of all rules; they believe, in effect,
that one could make a braver show on the back of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
a wild horse than on the back of a trained animal.
Genius can only furnish rich <i>material</i> for products
of beautiful art; its execution and its <i>form</i> require
talent cultivated in the schools, in order to make
such a use of this material as will stand examination
by the Judgement. But it is quite ridiculous for a
man to speak and decide like a genius in things
which require the most careful investigation by
Reason. One does not know whether to laugh
more at the impostor who spreads such a mist round
him that we cannot clearly use our Judgement and
so use our Imagination the more, or at the public
which naïvely imagines that his inability to cognise
clearly and to comprehend the masterpiece before
him arises from new truths crowding in on him in
such abundance that details (duly weighed definitions
and accurate examination of fundamental propositions)
seem but clumsy work.</p>
<h5 id="s48">§ 48. <i>Of the relation of Genius to Taste</i></h5>
<p>For <i>judging</i> of beautiful objects as such, <i>taste</i>
is requisite; but for beautiful art, <i>i.e.</i> for the <i>production</i>
of such objects, <i>genius</i> is requisite.</p>
<p>If we consider genius as the talent for beautiful
art (which the special meaning of the word implies)
and in this point of view analyse it into the faculties
which must concur to constitute such a talent, it is
necessary in the first instance to determine exactly
the difference between natural beauty, the judging
of which requires only Taste, and artificial beauty,
whose possibility (to which reference must be made
in judging such an object) requires Genius.</p>
<p>A natural beauty is a <i>beautiful thing</i>; artificial
beauty is a <i>beautiful representation</i> of a thing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
In order to judge of a natural beauty as such
I need not have beforehand a concept of what sort
of thing the object is to be; <i>i.e.</i> I need not know
its material purposiveness (the purpose), but its
mere form pleases by itself in the act of judging it
without any knowledge of the purpose. But if the
object is given as a product of art, and as such is
to be declared beautiful, then, because art always
supposes a purpose in the cause (and its causality),
there must be at bottom in the first instance a
concept of what the thing is to be. And as the
agreement of the manifold in a thing with its inner
destination, its purpose, constitutes the perfection
of the thing, it follows that in judging of artificial
beauty the perfection of the thing must be taken
into account; but in judging of natural beauty (as
<i>such</i>) there is no question at all about this.—It is
true that in judging of objects of nature, especially
objects endowed with life, <i>e.g.</i> a man or a horse,
their objective purposiveness also is commonly taken
into consideration in judging of their beauty; but
then the judgement is no longer purely aesthetical,
<i>i.e.</i> a mere judgement of taste. Nature is no longer
judged inasmuch as it appears like art, but in so
far as it <i>is</i> actual (although superhuman) art; and
the teleological judgement serves as the basis and
condition of the aesthetical, as a condition to which
the latter must have respect. In such a case, <i>e.g.</i>
if it is said “that is a beautiful woman,” we think
nothing else than this: nature represents in her
figure the purposes in view in the shape of a woman’s
figure. For we must look beyond the mere form to
a concept, if the object is to be thought in such a
way by means of a logically conditioned aesthetical
judgement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Beautiful art shows its superiority in this, that
it describes as beautiful things which may be in
nature ugly or displeasing.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79" id="FNanchor_79">79</a> The Furies, diseases,
the devastations of war, etc., may [even regarded
as calamitous],<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80" id="FNanchor_80">80</a> be described as very beautiful,
and even represented in a picture. There is only
one kind of ugliness which cannot be represented
in accordance with nature, without destroying all
aesthetical satisfaction and consequently artificial
beauty; viz. that which excites <i>disgust</i>. For in
this peculiar sensation, which rests on mere imagination,
the object is represented as it were obtruding
itself for our enjoyment while we strive against it
with all our might. And the artistic representation
of the object is no longer distinguished from the
nature of the object itself in our sensation, and thus
it is impossible that it can be regarded as beautiful.
The art of sculpture again, because in its products
art is almost interchangeable with nature, excludes
from its creations the immediate representation of
ugly objects; <i>e.g.</i> it represents death by a beautiful
genius, the warlike spirit by Mars, and permits
[all such things] to be represented only by an
allegory or attribute<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81" id="FNanchor_81">81</a> that has a pleasing effect, and
thus only indirectly by the aid of the interpretation of
Reason, and not for the mere aesthetical Judgement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
So much for the beautiful representation of an
object, which is properly only the form of the presentation
of a concept, and the means by which the
latter is communicated universally.—But to give
this form to the product of beautiful art, mere taste
is requisite. By taste, after he has exercised and
corrected it by manifold examples from art or nature,
the artist checks his work; and after many, often
toilsome, attempts to content taste he finds the
form which satisfies him. Hence this form is not,
as it were, a thing of inspiration or the result of a
free swing of the mental powers, but of a slow and
even painful process of improvement, by which he
seeks to render it adequate to his thought, without
detriment to the freedom of the play of his powers.</p>
<p>But taste is merely a judging and not a productive
faculty; and what is appropriate to it is not therefore
a work of beautiful art. It may be only a
product belonging to useful and mechanical art or
even to science, produced according to definite rules
that can be learned and must be exactly followed.
But the pleasing form that is given to it is only the
vehicle of communication, and a mode, as it were,
of presenting it, in respect of which we remain free
to a certain extent, although it is combined with
a definite purpose. Thus we desire that table
appointments, a moral treatise, even a sermon,
should have in themselves this form of beautiful
art, without it seeming to be <i>sought</i>: but we do not
therefore call these things works of beautiful art.
Under the latter class are reckoned a poem, a piece
of music, a picture gallery, etc.; and in some would-be
works of beautiful art we find genius without
taste, while in others we find taste without genius.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s49">§ 49. <i>Of the faculties of the mind that constitute
Genius</i></h5>
<p>We say of certain products of which we expect
that they should at least in part appear as beautiful
art, they are without <i>spirit</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_82" id="FNanchor_82">82</a>; although we find
nothing to blame in them on the score of taste. A
poem may be very neat and elegant, but without
spirit. A history may be exact and well arranged,
but without spirit. A festal discourse may be solid
and at the same time elaborate, but without spirit.
Conversation is often not devoid of entertainment,
but yet without spirit: even of a woman we say
that she is pretty, an agreeable talker, and courteous,
but without spirit. What then do we mean by
spirit?</p>
<p><i>Spirit</i>, in an aesthetical sense, is the name given
to the animating principle of the mind. But that
whereby this principle animates the soul, the
material which it applies to that [purpose], is that
which puts the mental powers purposively into
swing, <i>i.e.</i> into such a play as maintains itself and
strengthens the [mental] powers in their exercise.</p>
<p>Now I maintain that this principle is no other
than the faculty of presenting <i>aesthetical Ideas</i>.
And by an aesthetical Idea I understand that representation
of the Imagination which occasions much
thought, without, however, any definite thought, <i>i.e.</i>
any <i>concept</i>, being capable of being adequate to
it; it consequently cannot be completely compassed
and made intelligible by language.—We easily
see that it is the counterpart (pendant) of a <i>rational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Idea</i>, which conversely is a concept to which no
<i>intuition</i> (or representation of the Imagination) can
be adequate.</p>
<p>The Imagination (as a productive faculty of
cognition) is very powerful in creating another
nature, as it were, out of the material that actual
nature gives it. We entertain ourselves with it
when experience proves too commonplace, and by
it we remould experience, always indeed in accordance
with analogical laws, but yet also in accordance
with principles which occupy a higher place in
Reason (laws too which are just as natural to us as
those by which Understanding comprehends empirical
nature). Thus we feel our freedom from the
law of association (which attaches to the empirical
employment of Imagination), so that the material
which we borrow from nature in accordance with
this law can be worked up into something different
which surpasses nature.</p>
<p>Such representations of the Imagination we may
call <i>Ideas</i>, partly because they at least strive after
something which lies beyond the bounds of experience,
and so seek to approximate to a presentation
of concepts of Reason (intellectual Ideas), thus
giving to the latter the appearance of objective
reality,—but especially because no concept can be
fully adequate to them as internal intuitions. The
poet ventures to realise to sense, rational Ideas of
invisible beings, the kingdom of the blessed, hell,
eternity, creation, etc.; or even if he deals with
things of which there are examples in experience,—<i>e.g.</i>
death, envy and all vices, also love, fame, and
the like,—he tries, by means of Imagination, which
emulates the play of Reason in its quest after a
maximum, to go beyond the limits of experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
and to present them to Sense with a completeness
of which there is no example in nature. It is,
properly speaking, in the art of the poet, that the
faculty of aesthetical Ideas can manifest itself in its
full measure. But this faculty, considered in itself,
is properly only a talent (of the Imagination).</p>
<p>If now we place under a concept a representation
of the Imagination belonging to its presentation,
but which occasions solely by itself more thought
than can ever be comprehended in a definite
concept, and which therefore enlarges aesthetically
the concept itself in an unbounded fashion,—the
Imagination is here creative, and it brings the
faculty of intellectual Ideas (the Reason) into movement;
<i>i.e.</i> a movement, occasioned by a representation,
towards more thought (though belonging, no
doubt, to the concept of the object) than can be
grasped in the representation or made clear.</p>
<p>Those forms which do not constitute the presentation
of a given concept itself but only, as
approximate representations of the Imagination,
express the consequences bound up with it and its
relationship to other concepts, are called (aesthetical)
<i>attributes</i> of an object, whose concept as a
rational Idea cannot be adequately presented. Thus
Jupiter’s eagle with the lightning in its claws is an
attribute of the mighty king of heaven, as the
peacock is of its magnificent queen. They do not,
like <i>logical attributes</i>, represent what lies in our
concepts of the sublimity and majesty of creation,
but something different, which gives occasion to
the Imagination to spread itself over a number of
kindred representations, that arouse more thought
than can be expressed in a concept determined by
words. They furnish an <i>aesthetical Idea</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
for that rational Idea takes the place of logical
presentation; and thus as their proper office they
enliven the mind by opening out to it the prospect
into an illimitable field of kindred representations.
But beautiful art does this not only in the case of
painting or sculpture (in which the term “attribute”
is commonly employed): poetry and rhetoric also
get the spirit that animates their works simply
from the aesthetical attributes of the object, which
accompany the logical and stimulate the Imagination,
so that it thinks more by their aid, although
in an undeveloped way, than could be comprehended
in a concept and therefore in a definite form of
words.— For the sake of brevity I must limit
myself to a few examples only.</p>
<p>When the great King<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_83" id="FNanchor_83">83</a> in one of his poems
expresses himself as follows:</p>
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Oui, finissons sans trouble et mourons sans regrets,<br></span>
<span class="i0">En laissant l’univers comblé de nos bienfaits.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ainsi l’astre du jour au bout de sa carrière,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Répand sur l’horizon une douce lumière;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Et les derniers rayons qu’il darde dans les airs,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Sont les derniers soupirs qu’il donne à l’univers;”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0">he quickens his rational Idea of a cosmopolitan
disposition at the end of life by an attribute which
the Imagination (in remembering all the pleasures
of a beautiful summer day that are recalled at its
close by a serene evening) associates with that
representation, and which excites a number of
sensations and secondary representations for which
no expression is found. On the other hand, an
intellectual concept may serve conversely as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
attribute for a representation of sense and so can
quicken this latter by means of the Idea of the
supersensible; but only by the aesthetical [element],
that subjectively attaches to the concept of the
latter, being here employed. Thus, for example, a
certain poet<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_84" id="FNanchor_84">84</a> says, in his description of a beautiful
morning:</p>
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“The sun arose<br></span>
<span class="i0">As calm from virtue springs.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0">The consciousness of virtue, even if one only places
oneself in thought in the position of a virtuous man,
diffuses in the mind a multitude of sublime and
restful feelings and a boundless prospect of a joyful
future, to which no expression measured by a definite
concept completely attains.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85" id="FNanchor_85">85</a></p>
<p>In a word the aesthetical Idea is a representation
of the Imagination associated with a given concept,
which is bound up with such a multiplicity of partial
representations in its free employment, that for it no
expression marking a definite concept can be found;
and such a representation, therefore, adds to a
concept much ineffable thought, the feeling of which
quickens the cognitive faculties, and with language,
which is the mere letter, binds up spirit also.</p>
<p>The mental powers, therefore, whose union (in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
certain relation) constitutes <i>genius</i> are Imagination
and Understanding. In the employment of the
Imagination for cognition it submits to the constraint
of the Understanding and is subject to the limitation
of being conformable to the concept of the latter.
On the other hand, in an aesthetical point of view it
is free to furnish unsought, over and above that
agreement with a concept, abundance of undeveloped
material for the Understanding; to which the
Understanding paid no regard in its concept, but
which it applies, though not objectively for cognition,
yet subjectively to quicken the cognitive
powers and therefore also indirectly to cognitions.
Thus genius properly consists in the happy relation
[between these faculties], which no science can teach
and no industry can learn, by which Ideas are found
for a given concept; and on the other hand, we thus
find for these Ideas the <i>expression</i>, by means of
which the subjective state of mind brought about by
them, as an accompaniment of the concept, can be
communicated to others. The latter talent is properly
speaking what is called spirit; for to express
the ineffable element in the state of mind implied by
a certain representation and to make it universally
communicable—whether the expression be in speech
or painting or statuary—this requires a faculty of
seizing the quickly passing play of Imagination and
of unifying it in a concept (which is even on that
account original and discloses a new rule that could
not have been inferred from any preceding principles
or examples), that can be communicated without any
constraint [of rules].<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_86" id="FNanchor_86">86</a></p>
<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p>If after this analysis we look back to the explanation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
given above of what is called <i>genius</i>, we find:
<i>first</i>, that it is a talent for Art, not for Science, in
which clearly known rules must go beforehand and
determine the procedure. <i>Secondly</i>, as an artistic
talent it presupposes a definite concept of the product,
as the purpose, and therefore Understanding;
but it also presupposes a representation (although
an indeterminate one) of the material, <i>i.e.</i> of the
intuition, for the presentment of this concept; and,
therefore, a relation between the Imagination and
the Understanding. <i>Thirdly</i>, it shows itself not so
much in the accomplishment of the proposed purpose
in a presentment of a definite <i>concept</i>, as in the
enunciation or expression of <i>aesthetical Ideas</i>, which
contain abundant material for that very design; and
consequently it represents the Imagination as free
from all guidance of rules and yet as purposive in
reference to the presentment of the given concept.
Finally, in the <i>fourth</i> place, the unsought undesigned
subjective purposiveness in the free accordance of
the Imagination with the legality of the Understanding
presupposes such a proportion and disposition
of these faculties as no following of rules, whether
of science or of mechanical imitation, can bring
about, but which only the nature of the subject can
produce.</p>
<p>In accordance with these suppositions genius is
the exemplary originality of the natural gifts of a
subject in the <i>free</i> employment of his cognitive
faculties. In this way the product of a genius (as
regards what is to be ascribed to genius and not to
possible learning or schooling) is an example, not
to be imitated (for then that which in it is genius
and constitutes the spirit of the work would be lost),
but to be followed, by another genius; whom it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
awakens to a feeling of his own originality and
whom it stirs so to exercise his art in freedom from
the constraint of rules, that thereby a new rule is
gained for art, and thus his talent shows itself to be
exemplary. But because a genius is a favourite of
nature and must be regarded by us as a rare phenomenon,
his example produces for other good heads
a school, <i>i.e.</i> a methodical system of teaching according
to rules, so far as these can be derived from the
peculiarities of the products of his spirit. For such
persons beautiful art is so far imitation, to which
nature through the medium of a genius supplied
the rule.</p>
<p>But this imitation becomes a mere <i>aping</i>, if the
scholar <i>copies</i> everything down to the deformities,
which the genius must have let pass only because
he could not well remove them without weakening
his Idea. This mental characteristic is meritorious
only in the case of a genius. A certain <i>audacity</i> in
expression—and in general many a departure from
common rules—becomes him well, but it is in no
way worthy of imitation; it always remains a fault
in itself which we must seek to remove, though the
genius is as it were privileged to commit it, because
the inimitable rush of his spirit would suffer from
over-anxious carefulness. <i>Mannerism</i> is another
kind of aping, viz. of mere <i>peculiarity</i> (originality) in
general; by which a man separates himself as far as
possible from imitators, without however possessing
the talent to be at the same time <i>exemplary</i>.—There
are indeed in general two ways (<i>modi</i>) in
which such a man may put together his notions of
expressing himself; the one is called a <i>manner</i> (<i>modus
aestheticus</i>), the other a <i>method</i> (<i>modus logicus</i>). They
differ in this, that the former has no other standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
than the <i>feeling</i> of unity in the presentment, but the
latter follows definite <i>principles</i>; hence the former
alone avails for beautiful art. But an artistic product
is said to show <i>mannerism</i> only when the
exposition of the artist’s Idea is <i>founded</i> on its very
singularity, and is not made appropriate to the Idea
itself. The ostentatious (<i>précieux</i>), contorted, and
affected [manner, adopted] to differentiate oneself
from ordinary persons (though devoid of spirit) is
like the behaviour of a man of whom we say, that
he hears himself talk, or who stands and moves
about as if he were on a stage in order to be stared
at; this always betrays a bungler.</p>
<h5 id="s50">§ 50. <i>Of the combination of Taste with Genius in
the products of beautiful Art</i></h5>
<p>To ask whether it is more important for the
things of beautiful art that Genius or Taste should
be displayed, is the same as to ask whether in it
more depends on Imagination or on Judgement.
Now, since in respect of the first an art is rather
said to be <i>full of spirit</i>, but only deserves to be
called a <i>beautiful</i> art on account of the second;
this latter is at least, as its indispensable condition
(<i>conditio sine qua non</i>), the most important thing
to which one has to look in the judging of art as
beautiful art. Abundance and originality of Ideas
are less necessary to beauty than the accordance
of the Imagination in its freedom with the conformity
to law of the Understanding. For all the abundance
of the former produces in lawless freedom nothing
but nonsense; on the other hand, the Judgement
is the faculty by which it is adjusted to the
Understanding.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Taste, like the Judgement in general, is the
discipline (or training) of Genius; it clips its wings
closely, and makes it cultured and polished; but, at
the same time, it gives guidance as to where and
how far it may extend itself, if it is to remain
purposive. And while it brings clearness and order
into the multitude of the thoughts, it makes the
Ideas susceptible of being permanently and, at the
same time, universally assented to, and capable of
being followed by others, and of an ever-progressive
culture. If, then, in the conflict of these two properties
in a product something must be sacrificed, it should
be rather on the side of genius; and the Judgement,
which in the things of beautiful art gives its decision
from its own proper principles, will rather sacrifice
the freedom and wealth of the Imagination than
permit anything prejudicial to the Understanding.</p>
<p>For beautiful art, therefore, <i>Imagination</i>, <i>Understanding</i>,
<i>Spirit</i>, and <i>Taste</i> are requisite.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_87" id="FNanchor_87">87</a></p>
<h5 id="s51">§ 51. <i>Of the division of the beautiful arts</i></h5>
<p>We may describe beauty in general (whether
natural or artificial) as the <i>expression</i> of aesthetical
Ideas; only that in beautiful Art this Idea must
be occasioned by a concept of the Object; whilst
in beautiful Nature the mere reflection upon a
given intuition, without any concept of what the
object is to be, is sufficient for the awakening and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
communicating of the Idea of which that Object
is regarded as the <i>expression</i>.</p>
<p>If, then, we wish to make a division of the
beautiful arts, we cannot choose a more convenient
principle, at least tentatively, than the analogy of
art with the mode of expression of which men
avail themselves in speech, in order to communicate
to one another as perfectly as possible not merely
their concepts but also their sensations.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_88" id="FNanchor_88">88</a>—This
is done by <i>word</i>, <i>deportment</i>, and <i>tone</i> (articulation,
gesticulation, and modulation). It is only by the
combination of these three kinds of expression that
communication between the speaker [and his hearers]
can be complete. For thus thought, intuition, and
sensation are transmitted to others simultaneously
and conjointly.</p>
<p>There are, therefore, only three kinds of beautiful
arts; the arts of <i>speech</i>, the <i>formative</i> arts, and the
art of the <i>play of sensations</i> (as external sensible
impressions). We may also arrange a division by
dichotomy; thus beautiful art may be divided
into the art of expression of thoughts and of intuitions;
and these further subdivided in accordance
with their form or their matter (sensation). But
this would appear to be too abstract, and not so
accordant with ordinary concepts.</p>
<p>(1) The arts of <span class="smcap smaller">SPEECH</span> are <i>rhetoric</i> and <i>poetry</i>.
<i>Rhetoric</i> is the art of carrying on a serious business
of the Understanding as if it were a free play of
the Imagination; <i>poetry</i>, the art of conducting a
free play of the Imagination as if it were a serious
business of the Understanding.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
The <i>orator</i>, then, promises a serious business,
and in order to entertain his audience conducts it
as if it were a mere <i>play</i> with Ideas. The <i>poet</i>
merely promises an entertaining play with Ideas,
and yet it has the same effect upon the Understanding
as if he had only intended to carry on
its business. The combination and harmony of
both cognitive faculties, Sensibility and Understanding,
which cannot dispense with one another,
but which yet cannot well be united without constraint
and mutual prejudice, must appear to be undesigned
and so to be brought about by themselves:
otherwise it is not <i>beautiful</i> art. Hence, all that
is studied and anxious must be avoided in it, for
beautiful art must be free art in a double sense.
It is not a work like that of a tradesman, the
magnitude of which can be judged, exacted, or
paid for, according to a definite standard; and again,
though the mind is occupied, still it feels itself
contented and stimulated, without looking to any
other purpose (independently of reward.)</p>
<p>The orator therefore gives something which he
does not promise, viz. an entertaining play of the
Imagination; but he also fails to supply what he
did promise, which is indeed his announced business,
viz. the purposive occupation of the Understanding.
On the other hand, the poet promises
little and announces a mere play with Ideas; but
he supplies something which is worth occupying
ourselves with, because he provides in this play
food for the Understanding, and by the aid of
Imagination gives life to his concepts. [Thus the
orator on the whole gives less, the poet more, than
he promises.]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89" id="FNanchor_89">89</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
(2) The <span class="smcap smaller">FORMATIVE</span> arts, or those by which expression
is found for Ideas in <i>sensible intuition</i> (not
by representations of mere Imagination that are
aroused by words), are either arts of <i>sensible truth</i> or
of <i>sensible illusion</i>. The former is called <i>Plastic</i>, the
latter <i>Painting</i>. Both express Ideas by figures in
space; the former makes figures cognisable by two
senses, sight and touch (although not by the latter
as far as beauty is concerned); the latter only by
one, the first of these. The aesthetical Idea (the
archetype or original image) is fundamental for both
in the Imagination, but the figure which expresses
this (the ectype or copy) is either given in its
bodily extension (as the object itself exists), or as it
paints itself on the eye (according to its appearance
when projected on a flat surface). In the first case<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90" id="FNanchor_90">90</a>
the condition given to reflection may be either the
reference to an actual purpose or only the semblance
of it.</p>
<p>To <i>Plastic</i>, the first kind of beautiful formative
Art, belong <i>Sculpture</i> and <i>Architecture</i>. The <i>first</i>
presents corporeally concepts of things, <i>as they
might have existed in nature</i> (though as beautiful art
it has regard to aesthetical purposiveness). The
<i>second</i> is the art of presenting concepts of things
that are possible <i>only through Art</i>, and whose form
has for its determining ground not nature but an
arbitrary purpose, with the view of presenting them
with aesthetical purposiveness. In the latter the
chief point is a certain <i>use</i> of the artistic object, by
which condition the aesthetical Ideas are limited.
In the former the main design is the mere <i>expression</i>
of aesthetical Ideas. Thus statues of men, gods,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
animals, etc., are of the first kind; but temples,
splendid buildings for public assemblies, even
dwelling-houses, triumphal arches, columns, mausoleums,
and the like, erected in honourable remembrance,
belong to Architecture. Indeed all house
furniture (upholsterer’s work and such like things
which are for use) may be reckoned under this art;
because the suitability of a product for a certain use is
the essential thing in an <i>architectural work</i>. On the
other hand, a mere <i>piece of sculpture</i>, which is simply
made for show and which is to please in itself, is as
a corporeal presentation a mere imitation of nature,
though with a reference to aesthetical Ideas; in it
<i>sensible truth</i> is not to be carried so far that the
product ceases to look like art and looks like a product
of the elective will.</p>
<p><i>Painting</i>, as the second kind of formative art,
which presents a <i>sensible illusion</i> artificially combined
with Ideas, I would divide into the art of the
beautiful <i>depicting of nature</i> and that of the beautiful
<i>arrangement of its products</i>. The first is <i>painting
proper</i>, the second is the art of <i>landscape gardening</i>.
The first gives only the illusory appearance of
corporeal extension; the second gives this in
accordance with truth, but only the appearance of
utility and availableness for other purposes than the
mere play of the Imagination in the contemplation
of its forms.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_91" id="FNanchor_91">91</a> This latter is nothing else than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
ornamentation of the soil with a variety of those
things (grasses, flowers, shrubs, trees, even ponds,
hillocks, and dells) which nature presents to an
observer, only arranged differently and in conformity
with certain Ideas. But, again, the beautiful arrangement
of corporeal things is only apparent to the eye,
like painting; the sense of touch cannot supply any
intuitive presentation of such a form. Under painting
in the wide sense I would reckon the decoration
of rooms by the aid of tapestry, bric-a-brac, and all
beautiful furniture which is merely available to be
<i>looked</i> at; and the same may be said of the art of
tasteful dressing (with rings, snuff-boxes, etc.). For
a bed of various flowers, a room filled with various
ornaments (including under this head even ladies’
finery), make at a fête a kind of picture; which, like
pictures properly so-called (that are not intended to
<i>teach</i> either history or natural science), has in view
merely the entertainment of the Imagination in free
play with Ideas, and the occupation of the aesthetical
Judgement without any definite purpose. The
detailed work in all this decoration may be quite
distinct in the different cases and may require
very different artists; but the judgement of taste
upon whatever is beautiful in these various arts is
always determined in the same way: viz. it only
judges the forms (without any reference to a
purpose) as they present themselves to the eye
either singly or in combination, according to the
effect they produce upon the Imagination.—But
that formative art may be compared (by analogy)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
with deportment in speech is justified by the fact
that the spirit of the artist supplies by these figures
a bodily expression to his thought and its mode, and
makes the thing itself as it were speak in mimic
language. This is a very common play of our
fancy, which attributes to lifeless things a spirit
suitable to their form by which they speak to us.</p>
<p>(3) The art of the <span class="smcap smaller">BEAUTIFUL PLAY OF SENSATIONS</span>
(externally stimulated), which admits at the
same time of universal communication, can be concerned
with nothing else than the proportion of the
different degrees of the disposition (tension) of the
sense, to which the sensation belongs, <i>i.e.</i> with its tone.
In this far-reaching signification of the word it may
be divided into the artistic play of the sensations of
hearing and sight, <i>i.e.</i> into <i>Music</i> and the <i>Art of
colour</i>.—It is noteworthy that these two senses,
besides their susceptibility for impressions so far as
these are needed to gain concepts of external objects,
are also capable of a peculiar sensation bound up
therewith, of which we cannot strictly decide whether
it is based on sense or reflection. This susceptibility
may sometimes be wanting, although in other respects
the sense, as regards its use for the cognition of
Objects, is not at all deficient but is peculiarly fine.
That is, we cannot say with certainty whether
colours or tones (sounds) are merely pleasant sensations
or whether they form in themselves a beautiful
play of sensations, and as such bring with them
in aesthetical judgement a satisfaction in their form.
If we think of the velocity of the vibrations of light,
or in the second case of the air, which probably far
surpasses all our faculty of judging immediately in
perception the time interval between them, we must
believe that it is only the <i>effect</i> of these vibrations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
upon the elastic parts of our body that is felt, but
that the <i>time interval</i> between them is not remarked
or brought into judgement; and thus that only
pleasantness and not beauty of composition is bound
up with colours and tones. But on the other hand,
<i>first</i>, we think of the mathematical [element] which
enables us to pronounce on the proportion between
these oscillations in music and thus to judge of
them; and by analogy with which we easily may
judge of the distinctions between colours. <i>Secondly</i>,
we recall instances (although they are rare) of men
who with the best sight in the world cannot distinguish
colours, and with the sharpest hearing
cannot distinguish tones; whilst for those who can
do this the perception of an altered quality (not
merely of the degree of sensation) in the different
intensities in the scale of colours and tones is
definite; and further, the very number of these is
fixed by <i>intelligible</i> differences. Thus we may be
compelled to see that both kinds of sensations are
to be regarded not as mere sensible impressions,
but as the effects of a judgement passed upon the
form in the play of divers sensations. The difference
in our definition, according as we adopt the
one or the other opinion in judging of the grounds
of Music, would be just this: either, as we have
done, we must explain it as the beautiful play of
sensations (of hearing), or else as a play of <i>pleasant</i>
sensations. According to the former mode of
explanation music is represented altogether as a
<i>beautiful</i> art; according to the latter, as a <i>pleasant</i>
art (at least in part).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s52">§ 52. <i>Of the combination of beautiful arts in one
and the same product</i></h5>
<p>Rhetoric may be combined with a pictorial presentation
of its subjects and objects in a <i>theatrical
piece</i>; poetry may be combined with music in a
<i>song</i>, and this again with pictorial (theatrical) presentation
in an <i>opera</i>; the play of sensations in
music may be combined with the play of figures in
the <i>dance</i>, and so on. Even the presentation of the
sublime, so far as it belongs to beautiful art, may
combine with beauty in a <i>tragedy in verse</i>, in a
<i>didactic poem</i>, in an <i>oratorio</i>; and in these combinations
beautiful art is yet more artistic. Whether it
is also more beautiful may in some of these cases be
doubted (since so many different kinds of satisfaction
cross one another). Yet in all beautiful art the
essential thing is the form, which is purposive as
regards our observation and judgement, where the
pleasure is at the same time cultivation and disposes
the spirit to Ideas, and consequently makes it susceptible
of still more of such pleasure and entertainment.
The essential element is not the matter
of sensation (charm or emotion), which has only to
do with enjoyment; this leaves behind nothing in
the Idea, and it makes the spirit dull, the object
gradually distasteful, and the mind, on account of
its consciousness of a disposition that conflicts with
purpose in the judgement of Reason, discontented
with itself and peevish.</p>
<p>If the beautiful arts are not brought into more or
less close combination with moral Ideas, which alone
bring with them a self-sufficing satisfaction, this latter
fate must ultimately be theirs. They then serve only
as a distraction, of which we are the more in need the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
more we avail ourselves of them to disperse the discontent
of the mind with itself; so that we thus render
ourselves ever more useless and ever more discontented.
The beauties of nature are generally of most
benefit in this point of view, if we are early accustomed
to observe, appreciate, and admire them.</p>
<h5 id="s53">§ 53. <i>Comparison of the respective aesthetical worth
of the beautiful arts</i></h5>
<p>Of all the arts <i>poetry</i> (which owes its origin
almost entirely to genius and will least be guided by
precept or example) maintains the first rank. It
expands the mind by setting the Imagination at
liberty; and by offering within the limits of a given
concept amid the unbounded variety of possible
forms accordant therewith, that which unites the
presentment of this concept with a wealth of thought,
to which no verbal expression is completely
adequate; and so rising aesthetically to Ideas. It
strengthens the mind by making it feel its faculty—free,
spontaneous and independent of natural determination—of
considering and judging nature as a
phenomenon in accordance with aspects which it
does not present in experience either for Sense or
Understanding, and therefore of using it on behalf
of, and as a sort of schema for, the supersensible.
It plays with illusion, which it produces at pleasure,
but without deceiving by it; for it declares its
exercise to be mere play, which however can be purposively
used by the Understanding.—Rhetoric,
in so far as this means the art of persuasion, <i>i.e.</i>
of deceiving by a beautiful show (<i>ars oratoria</i>),
and not mere elegance of speech (eloquence and
style), is a Dialectic, which borrows from poetry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
only so much as is needful to win minds to the side
of the orator before they have formed a judgement,
and to deprive them of their freedom; it cannot
therefore be recommended either for the law courts
or for the pulpit. For if we are dealing with civil
law, with the rights of individual persons, or with
lasting instruction and determination of people’s
minds to an accurate knowledge and a conscientious
observance of their duty, it is unworthy of so
important a business to allow a trace of any exuberance
of wit and imagination to appear, and still
less any trace of the art of talking people over and
of captivating them for the advantage of any chance
person. For although this art may sometimes be
directed to legitimate and praiseworthy designs, it
becomes objectionable, when in this way maxims and
dispositions are spoiled in a subjective point of view,
though the action may objectively be lawful. It is
not enough to do what is right; we should practise
it solely on the ground that it is right. Again, the
mere concept of this species of matters of human
concern, when clear and combined with a lively
presentation of it in examples, without any offence
against the rules of euphony of speech or propriety
of expression, has by itself for Ideas of Reason (which
collectively constitute eloquence), sufficient influence
upon human minds; so that it is not needful to add
the machinery of persuasion, which, since it can be
used equally well to beautify or to hide vice and
error, cannot quite lull the secret suspicion that one
is being artfully overreached. In poetry everything
proceeds with honesty and candour. It
declares itself to be a mere entertaining play of the
Imagination, which wishes to proceed as regards
form in harmony with the laws of the Understanding;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and it does not desire to steal upon and
ensnare the Understanding by the aid of sensible
presentation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92" id="FNanchor_92">92</a></p>
<p>After poetry, <i>if we are to deal with charm and
mental movement</i>, I would place that art which comes
nearest to the art of speech and can very naturally
be united with it, viz. <i>the art of tone</i>. For although
it speaks by means of mere sensations without concepts,
and so does not, like poetry, leave anything
over for reflection, it yet moves the mind in a greater
variety of ways and more intensely, although only
transitorily. It is, however, rather enjoyment than
culture (the play of thought that is incidentally
excited by its means is merely the effect of a kind of
mechanical association); and in the judgement of
Reason it has less worth than any other of the beautiful
arts. Hence, like all enjoyment, it desires constant
change, and does not bear frequent repetition without
producing weariness. Its charm, which admits
of universal communication, appears to rest on this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
that every expression of speech has in its context a
tone appropriate to the sense. This tone indicates
more or less an affection of the speaker, and produces
it also in the hearer; which affection excites
in its turn in the hearer the Idea that is expressed
in speech by the tone in question. Thus as modulation
is as it were a universal language of sensations
intelligible to every man, the art of tone employs
it by itself alone in its full force, viz. as a language
of the affections, and thus communicates universally
according to the laws of association the aesthetical
Ideas naturally combined therewith. Now these
aesthetical Ideas are not concepts or determinate
thoughts. Hence the form of the composition of
these sensations (harmony and melody) only serves
instead of the form of language, by means of their
proportionate accordance, to express the aesthetical
Idea of a connected whole of an unspeakable wealth
of thought, corresponding to a certain theme which
produces the dominating affection in the piece. This
can be brought mathematically under certain rules,
because it rests in the case of tones on the relation
between the number of vibrations of the air in the
same time, so far as these tones are combined simultaneously
or successively. To this mathematical
form, although not represented by determinate concepts,
alone attaches the satisfaction that unites the
mere reflection upon such a number of concomitant
or consecutive sensations with this their play, as a
condition of its beauty valid for every man. It is
this alone which permits Taste to claim in advance
a rightful authority over every one’s judgement.</p>
<p>But in the charm and mental movement produced
by Music, Mathematic has certainly not the slightest
share. It is only the indispensable condition (<i>conditio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
sine qua non</i>) of that proportion of the impressions
in their combination and in their alternation by
which it becomes possible to gather them together
and prevent them from destroying one another, and
to harmonise them so as to produce a continual
movement and animation of the mind, by means of
affections consonant therewith, and thus a delightful
personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we estimate the worth of
the Beautiful Arts by the culture they supply to the
mind, and take as a standard the expansion of the
faculties which must concur in the Judgement for
cognition, Music will have the lowest place among
them (as it has perhaps the highest among those arts
which are valued for their pleasantness), because it
merely plays with sensations. The formative arts
are far before it in this point of view; for in putting
the Imagination in a free play, which is also
accordant with the Understanding, they at the same
time carry on a serious business. This they do by
producing a product that serves for concepts as a
permanent self-commendatory vehicle for promoting
their union with sensibility and thus, as it were,
the urbanity of the higher cognitive powers. These
two species of art take quite different courses; the
first proceeds from sensations to indeterminate Ideas,
the second from determinate Ideas to sensations.
The latter produce <i>permanent</i>, the former only
<i>transitory</i> impressions. The Imagination can recall
the one and entertain itself pleasantly therewith;
but the other either vanish entirely, or if they are
recalled involuntarily by the Imagination they are
rather wearisome than pleasant.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_93" id="FNanchor_93">93</a> Besides, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
attaches to Music a certain want of urbanity from
the fact that, chiefly from the character of its instruments,
it extends its influence further than is desired
(in the neighbourhood), and so as it were obtrudes
itself, and does violence to the freedom of others
who are not of the musical company. The Arts
which appeal to the eyes do not do this; for we need
only turn our eyes away, if we wish to avoid being
impressed. The case of music is almost like that of
the delight derived from a smell that diffuses itself
widely. The man who pulls his perfumed handkerchief
out of his pocket attracts the attention of all
round him, even against their will, and he forces
them, if they are to breathe at all, to enjoy the
scent; hence this habit has gone out of fashion.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94" id="FNanchor_94">94</a></p>
<p>Among the formative arts I would give the palm
to painting; partly because as the art of delineation
it lies at the root of all the other formative arts, and
partly because it can penetrate much further into
the region of Ideas, and can extend the field of
intuition in conformity with them further than the
others can.</p>
<h5 id="s54">§ 54. <i>Remark</i></h5>
<p>As we have often shown, there is an essential
difference between <i>what satisfies simply in the act<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of judging it</i>, and that which <i>gratifies</i> (pleases in
sensation). We cannot ascribe the latter to every
one, as we can the former. Gratification (the causes
of which may even be situate in Ideas) appears
always to consist in a feeling of the furtherance of
the whole life of the man, and consequently, also
of his bodily well-being, <i>i.e.</i> his health; so that
<i>Epicurus</i>, who gave out that all gratification was at
bottom bodily sensation, may, perhaps, not have
been wrong, but only misunderstood himself when
he reckoned intellectual and even practical satisfaction
under gratification. If we have this distinction
in view we can explain how a gratification may
dissatisfy the man who sensibly feels it (<i>e.g.</i> the
joy of a needy but well-meaning man at becoming
the heir of an affectionate but penurious father);
or how a deep grief may satisfy the person experiencing
it (the sorrow of a widow at the death of her
excellent husband); or how a gratification can in
addition satisfy (as in the sciences that we pursue);
or how a grief (<i>e.g.</i> hatred, envy, revenge) can
moreover dissatisfy. The satisfaction or dissatisfaction
here depends on Reason, and is the same as
<i>approbation</i> or <i>disapprobation</i>; but gratification and
grief can only rest on the feeling or prospect of
a possible (on whatever grounds) <i>well-being</i> or <i>its
opposite</i>.</p>
<p>All changing free play of sensations (that have no
design at their basis) gratifies, because it promotes
the feeling of health. In the judgement of Reason
we may or may not have any satisfaction in its
object or even in this gratification; and this latter
may rise to the height of an affection, although we
take no interest in the object, at least none that is
proportionate to the degree of the affection. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
may subdivide this free play of sensations into the
<i>play of fortune</i> [games of chance], the <i>play of tone</i>
[music], and the <i>play of thought</i> [wit]. The <i>first</i>
requires an <i>interest</i>, whether of vanity or of selfishness;
which, however, is not nearly so great as the
interest that attaches to the way in which we are
striving to procure it. The <i>second</i> requires merely
the change of <i>sensations</i>, all of which have a relation
to affection, though they have not the degree of
affection, and excite aesthetical Ideas. The <i>third</i>
springs merely from the change of representations
in the Judgement; by it, indeed, no thought that
brings an interest with it is produced, but yet the
mind is animated thereby.</p>
<p>How much gratification games must afford,
without any necessity of placing at their basis an
interested design, all our evening parties show;
for hardly any of them can be carried on without a
game. But the affections of hope, fear, joy, wrath,
scorn, are put in play by them, alternating every
moment; and they are so vivid that by them, as
by a kind of internal motion, all the vital processes
of the body seem to be promoted, as is shown by
the mental vivacity excited by them, although
nothing is gained or learnt thereby. But as the
beautiful does not enter into games of chance, we
will here set them aside. On the other hand, music
and that which excites laughter are two different
kinds of play with aesthetical Ideas, or with representations
of the Understanding through which
ultimately nothing is thought; and yet they can
give lively gratification merely by their changes.
Thus we recognise pretty clearly that the animation
in both cases is merely bodily, although it is excited
by Ideas of the mind; and that the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
health produced by a motion of the intestines
corresponding to the play in question makes up
that whole gratification of a gay party, which is
regarded as so refined and so spiritual. It is not
the judging the harmony in tones or sallies of wit,—which
serves only in combination with their
beauty as a necessary vehicle,—but the furtherance
of the vital bodily processes, the affection that
moves the intestines and the diaphragm, in a word,
the feeling of health (which without such inducements
one does not feel) that makes up the gratification
felt by us; so that we can thus reach the body
through the soul and use the latter as the physician
of the former.</p>
<p>In music this play proceeds from bodily sensations
to aesthetical Ideas (the Objects of our
affections), and then from these back again to the
body with redoubled force. In the case of jokes
(the art of which, just like music, should rather be
reckoned as pleasant than beautiful) the play begins
with the thoughts which together occupy the body,
so far as they admit of sensible expression; and
as the Understanding stops suddenly short at this
presentment, in which it does not find what it expected,
we feel the effect of this slackening in the
body by the oscillation of the organs, which promotes
the restoration of equilibrium and has a favourable
influence upon health.</p>
<p>In everything that is to excite a lively convulsive
laugh there must be something absurd (in which the
Understanding, therefore, can find no satisfaction).
<i>Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden
transformation of a strained expectation into nothing.</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_95" id="FNanchor_95">95</a>
This transformation, which is certainly not enjoyable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
by the Understanding, yet indirectly gives it very
active enjoyment for a moment. Therefore its
cause must consist in the influence of the representation
upon the body, and the reflex effect of
this upon the mind; not, indeed, through the
representation being objectively an object of gratification<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96" id="FNanchor_96">96</a>
(for how could a delusive expectation
gratify?), but simply through it as a mere play of
representations bringing about an equilibrium of
the vital powers in the body.</p>
<p>Suppose this story to be told: An Indian at the
table of an Englishman in Surat, when he saw a
bottle of ale opened and all the beer turned into
froth and overflowing, testified his great astonishment
with many exclamations. When the Englishman
asked him, “What is there in this to astonish you so
much?” he answered, “I am not at all astonished
that it should flow out, but I do wonder how you
ever got it in.” At this story we laugh, and it gives
us hearty pleasure; not because we deem ourselves
cleverer than this ignorant man, or because of anything
else in it that we note as satisfactory to the
Understanding, but because our expectation was
strained [for a time] and then was suddenly
dissipated into nothing. Again: The heir of a
rich relative wished to arrange for an imposing
funeral, but he lamented that he could not properly
succeed; “for” (said he) “the more money I give
my mourners to look sad, the more cheerful they
look!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97" id="FNanchor_97">97</a> When we hear this story we laugh loud,
and the reason is that an expectation is suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
transformed into nothing. We must note well that
it does not transform itself into the positive opposite
of an expected object—for then there would still be
something, which might even be a cause of grief—but
it must be transformed into nothing. For if a
man arouses great expectations in us when telling a
story, and at the end we see its falsehood immediately,
it displeases us; <i>e.g.</i> the story of the people
whose hair in consequence of great grief turned
gray in one night. But if a wag, to repair the effect
of this story, describes very circumstantially the
grief of the merchant returning from India to
Europe with all his wealth in merchandise who was
forced to throw it overboard in a heavy storm,
and who grieved thereat so much that his <i>wig</i>
turned gray the same night—we laugh and it gives
us gratification. For we treat our own mistake in
the case of an object otherwise indifferent to us, or
rather the Idea which we are following out, as we
treat a ball which we knock to and fro for a time,
though our only serious intention is to seize it and
hold it fast. It is not the mere rebuff of a liar or
a simpleton that arouses our gratification; for the
latter story told with assumed seriousness would set
a whole company in a roar of laughter, while the
former would ordinarily not be regarded as worth
attending to.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in all such cases the jest
must contain something that is capable of deceiving
for a moment. Hence, when the illusion is dissipated,
the mind turns back to try it once again, and
thus through a rapidly alternating tension and relaxation
it is jerked back and put into a state of
oscillation. This, because the strain on the cord as
it were is suddenly (and not gradually) relaxed, must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
occasion a mental movement, and an inner bodily
movement harmonising therewith, which continues
involuntarily and fatigues, even while cheering us
(the effects of a motion conducive to health).</p>
<p>For if we admit that with all our thoughts is
harmonically combined a movement in the organs
of the body, we shall easily comprehend how to this
sudden transposition of the mind, now to one now
to another standpoint in order to contemplate its
object, may correspond an alternating tension and
relaxation of the elastic portions of our intestines,
which communicates itself to the diaphragm (like
that which ticklish people feel). In connexion with
this the lungs expel the air at rapidly succeeding
intervals, and thus bring about a movement
beneficial to health; which alone, and not what
precedes it in the mind, is the proper cause of the
gratification in a thought that at bottom represents
nothing.—<i>Voltaire</i> said that heaven had given us
two things to counterbalance the many miseries of
life, <i>hope</i> and <i>sleep</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_98" id="FNanchor_98">98</a> He could have added <i>laughter</i>,
if the means of exciting it in reasonable men were
only as easily attainable, and the requisite wit or
originality of humour were not so rare, as the talent
is common of imagining things which <i>break one’s
head</i>, as mystic dreamers do, or which <i>break one’s
neck</i>, as your genius does, or which <i>break one’s heart</i>,
as sentimental romance-writers (and even moralists
of the same kidney) do.</p>
<p>We may therefore, as it seems to me, readily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
concede to <i>Epicurus</i> that all gratification, even that
which is occasioned through concepts, excited by
aesthetical Ideas, is <i>animal</i>, <i>i.e.</i> bodily sensation;
without the least prejudice to the <i>spiritual</i> feeling
of respect for moral Ideas, which is not gratification
at all but an esteem for self (for humanity in us),
that raises us above the need of gratification, and
even without the slightest prejudice to the less
noble [feeling] of <i>taste</i>.</p>
<p>We find a combination of these two last in
<i>naiveté</i>, which is the breaking out of the sincerity
originally natural to humanity in opposition to that
art of dissimulation which has become a second
nature. We laugh at the simplicity that does not
understand how to dissemble; and yet we are
delighted with the simplicity of the nature which
thwarts that art. We look for the commonplace
manner of artificial utterance devised with foresight
to make a fair show; and behold! it is the
unspoiled innocent nature which we do not expect
to find, and which he who displays it did not think
of disclosing. That the fair but false show which
generally has so much influence upon our judgement
is here suddenly transformed into nothing, so that,
as it were, the rogue in us is laid bare, produces a
movement of the mind in two opposite directions,
which gives a wholesome shock to the body. But
the fact that something infinitely better than all
assumed manner, viz. purity of disposition (or at
least the tendency thereto), is not quite extinguished
yet in human nature, blends seriousness and high
esteem with this play of the Judgement. But because
it is only a transitory phenomenon and the
veil of dissimulation is soon drawn over it again,
there is mingled therewith a compassion which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
an emotion of tenderness; this, as play, readily
admits of combination with a good-hearted laugh,
and ordinarily is actually so combined, and withal is
wont to compensate him who supplies its material
for the embarrassment which results from not yet
being wise after the manner of men.—An art that
is to be <i>naive</i> is thus a contradiction; but the
representation of naiveté in a fictitious personage
is quite possible, and is a beautiful though a
rare art. Naiveté must not be confounded with
open-hearted simplicity, which does not artificially
spoil nature solely because it does not understand
the art of social intercourse.</p>
<p>The <i>humorous</i> manner again may be classified
as that which, as exhilarating us, is near akin to
the gratification that proceeds from laughter; and
belongs to the originality of spirit, but not to
the talent of beautiful art. <i>Humour</i> in the good
sense means the talent of being able voluntarily
to put oneself into a certain mental disposition,
in which everything is judged quite differently
from the ordinary method (reversed, in fact), and
yet in accordance with certain rational principles
in such a frame of mind. He who is involuntarily
subject to such mutations is called <i>a man of humours</i>
[launisch]; but he who can assume them voluntarily
and purposively (on behalf of a lively presentment
brought about by the aid of a contrast that excites
a laugh)—he and his manner of speech are called
<i>humorous</i> [launigt]. This manner, however, belongs
rather to pleasant than to beautiful art, because the
object of the latter must always exhibit intrinsic
worth, and hence requires a certain seriousness in
the presentation, as taste does in the act of
judgement.</p>

<h3 id="division_1_2">SECOND DIVISION<br>
<span class="subhead">DIALECTIC OF THE AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENT</span></h3>
<h5 id="s55">§ 55</h5>
<p>A faculty of Judgement that is to be dialectical
must in the first place be rationalising, <i>i.e.</i> its judgements
must claim universality<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_99" id="FNanchor_99">99</a> and that <i>a priori</i>;
for it is in the opposition of such judgements that
Dialectic consists. Hence the incompatibility of
aesthetical judgements of Sense (about the pleasant
and the unpleasant) is not dialectical. And again,
the conflict between judgements of Taste, so far
as each man depends merely on his own taste,
forms no Dialectic of taste; because no one proposes
to make his own judgement a universal rule. There
remains therefore no other concept of a Dialectic
which has to do with taste than that of a Dialectic
of the <i>Critique</i> of taste (not of taste itself) in respect
of its <i>principles</i>; for here concepts that contradict
one another (as to the ground of the possibility of
judgements of taste in general) naturally and unavoidably
present themselves. The transcendental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Critique of taste will therefore contain a part which
can bear the name of a Dialectic of the aesthetical
Judgement, only if and so far as there is found an
antinomy of the principles of this faculty which
renders its conformity to law, and consequently also
its internal possibility, doubtful.</p>
<h5 id="s56">§ 56. <i>Representation of the antinomy of Taste</i></h5>
<p>The first commonplace of taste is contained in
the proposition, with which every tasteless person
proposes to avoid blame: <i>every one has his own taste</i>.
That is as much as to say that the determining
ground of this judgement is merely subjective (gratification
or grief), and that the judgement has no
right to the necessary assent of others.</p>
<p>The second commonplace invoked even by those
who admit for judgements of taste the right to speak
with validity for every one is: <i>there is no disputing
about taste</i>. That is as much as to say that the determining
ground of a judgement of taste may indeed be
objective, but that it cannot be reduced to definite
concepts, and that consequently about the judgement
itself nothing can be <i>decided</i> by proofs, although
much may rightly be <i>contested</i>. For <i>contesting</i> [quarrelling]
and <i>disputing</i> [controversy] are doubtless the
same in this, that by means of the mutual opposition
of judgements they seek to produce their accordance;
but different in that the latter hopes to bring this
about according to definite concepts as determining
grounds, and consequently assumes <i>objective concepts</i>
as grounds of the judgement. But where this is
regarded as impracticable, controversy is regarded
as alike impracticable.</p>
<p>We easily see that between these two commonplaces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
there is a proposition wanting, which, though
it has not passed into a proverb, is yet familiar
to every one, viz. <i>there may be a quarrel about
taste</i> (although there can be no controversy). But
this proposition involves the contradictory of the
former one. For wherever quarrelling is permissible,
there must be a hope of mutual reconciliation;
and consequently we can count on grounds of our
judgement that have not merely private validity, and
therefore are not merely subjective. And to this
the proposition, <i>every one has his own taste</i>, is
directly opposed.</p>
<p>There emerges therefore in respect of the principle
of taste the following <span class="locked">Antinomy:—</span></p>
<p>(1) <i>Thesis.</i> The judgement of taste is not
based upon concepts; for otherwise it would
admit of controversy (would be determinable by
proofs).</p>
<p>(2) <i>Antithesis.</i> The judgement of taste is based
on concepts; for otherwise, despite its diversity, we
could not quarrel about it (we could not claim for
our judgement the necessary assent of others).</p>
<h5 id="s57">§ 57. <i>Solution of the antinomy of Taste</i></h5>
<p>There is no possibility of removing the conflict
between these principles that underlie every judgement
of taste (which are nothing else than the two
peculiarities of the judgement of taste exhibited
above in the Analytic), except by showing that the
concept to which we refer the Object in this kind
of judgement is not taken in the same sense in both
maxims of the aesthetical Judgement. This twofold
sense or twofold point of view is necessary to our
transcendental Judgement; but also the illusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
which arises from the confusion of one with the
other is natural and unavoidable.</p>
<p>The judgement of taste must refer to some concept;
otherwise it could make absolutely no claim
to be necessarily valid for every one. But it is not
therefore capable of being proved <i>from</i> a concept;
because a concept may be either determinable or in
itself undetermined and undeterminable. The concepts
of the Understanding are of the former kind;
they are determinable through predicates of sensible
intuition which can correspond to them. But the
transcendental rational concept of the supersensible,
which lies at the basis of all sensible intuition, is of
the latter kind, and therefore cannot be theoretically
determined further.</p>
<p>Now the judgement of taste is applied to objects
of Sense, but not with a view of determining a <i>concept</i>
of them for the Understanding; for it is not a
cognitive judgement. It is thus only a private
judgement, in which a singular representation intuitively
perceived is referred to the feeling of pleasure;
and so far would be limited as regards its validity
to the individual judging. The object is <i>for me</i> an
object of satisfaction; by others it may be regarded
quite differently—every one has his own taste.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there is undoubtedly contained in
the judgement of taste a wider reference of the
representation of the Object (as well as of the
subject), whereon we base an extension of judgements
of this kind as necessary for every one. At
the basis of this there must necessarily be a concept
somewhere; though a concept which cannot be
determined through intuition. But through a concept
of this sort we know nothing, and consequently
it can <i>supply no proof</i> for the judgement of taste.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Such a concept is the mere pure rational concept of
the supersensible which underlies the object (and
also the subject judging it), regarded as an Object
of sense and thus as phenomenon.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100" id="FNanchor_100">100</a> For if we do
not admit such a reference, the claim of the judgement
of taste to universal validity would not hold
good. If the concept on which it is based were
only a mere confused concept of the Understanding,
like that of perfection, with which we could bring
the sensible intuition of the Beautiful into correspondence,
it would be at least possible in itself to
base the judgement of taste on proofs; which contradicts
the thesis.</p>
<p>But all contradiction disappears if I say: the
judgement of taste is based on a concept (viz. the
concept of the general ground of the subjective
purposiveness of nature for the Judgement); from
which, however, nothing can be known and proved
in respect of the Object, because it is in itself
undeterminable and useless for knowledge. Yet at
the same time and on that very account the judgement
has validity for every one (though of course
for each only as a singular judgement immediately
accompanying his intuition); because its determining
ground lies perhaps in the concept of that which
may be regarded as the supersensible substrate of
humanity.</p>
<p>The solution of an antinomy only depends on
the possibility of showing that two apparently contradictory
propositions do not contradict one another
in fact, but that they may be consistent; although the
explanation of the possibility of their concept may
transcend our cognitive faculties. That this illusion
is natural and unavoidable by human Reason, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
also why it is so, and remains so, although it ceases
to deceive after the analysis of the apparent contradiction,
may be thus explained.</p>
<p>In the two contradictory judgements we take the
concept, on which the universal validity of a judgement
must be based, in the same sense; and yet we
apply to it two opposite predicates. In the Thesis
we mean that the judgement of taste is not based
upon <i>determinate</i> concepts; and in the Antithesis
that the judgement of taste is based upon a concept,
but an <i>indeterminate</i> one (viz. of the supersensible
substrate of phenomena). Between these two there
is no contradiction.</p>
<p>We can do nothing more than remove this
conflict between the claims and counter-claims of
taste. It is absolutely impossible to give a definite
objective principle of taste, in accordance with
which its judgements could be derived, examined,
and established; for then the judgement would not
be one of taste at all. The subjective principle,
viz. the indefinite Idea of the supersensible in us,
can only be put forward as the sole key to the
puzzle of this faculty whose sources are hidden
from us: it can be made no further intelligible.</p>
<p>The proper concept of taste, that is of a merely
reflective aesthetical Judgement, lies at the basis of
the antinomy here exhibited and adjusted. Thus
the two apparently contradictory principles are
reconciled—<i>both can be true</i>; which is sufficient.
If, on the other hand, we assume, as some do,
<i>pleasantness</i> as the determining ground of taste (on
account of the singularity of the representation
which lies at the basis of the judgement of taste), or,
as others will have it, the principle of perfection (on
account of the universality of the same), and settle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
the definition of taste accordingly; then there arises
an antinomy which it is absolutely impossible to
adjust except by showing that <i>both</i> the contrary
(though not contradictory) <i>propositions are false</i>.
And this would prove that the concept on which
they are based is self-contradictory. Hence we see
that the removal of the antinomy of the aesthetical
Judgement takes a course similar to that pursued by
the Critique in the solution of the antinomies of pure
theoretical Reason. And thus here, as also in the
Critique of practical Reason, the antinomies force us
against our will to look beyond the sensible and to
seek in the supersensible the point of union for all
our <i>a priori</i> faculties; because no other expedient is
left to make our Reason harmonious with itself.</p>
<h6><i>Remark I.</i></h6>
<p>As we so often find occasion in Transcendental
Philosophy for distinguishing Ideas from concepts of
the Understanding, it may be of use to introduce
technical terms to correspond to this distinction. I
believe that no one will object if I propose some.—In
the most universal signification of the word,
Ideas are representations referred to an object,
according to a certain (subjective or objective)
principle, but so that they can never become a
cognition of it. They are either referred to an
intuition, according to a merely subjective principle
of the mutual harmony of the cognitive powers
(the Imagination and the Understanding), and they
are then called <i>aesthetical</i>; or they are referred to
a concept according to an objective principle,
although they can never furnish a cognition of the
object and are called <i>rational Ideas</i>. In the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
case the concept is a <i>transcendent</i> one, which is
different from a concept of the Understanding, to
which an adequately corresponding experience can
always be supplied, and which therefore is called
<i>immanent</i>.</p>
<p>An <i>aesthetical Idea</i> cannot become a cognition,
because it is an <i>intuition</i> (of the Imagination) for
which an adequate concept can never be found.
A <i>rational Idea</i> can never become a cognition,
because it involves a concept (of the supersensible),
corresponding to which an intuition can never be
given.</p>
<p>Now I believe we might call the aesthetical Idea
an <i>inexponible</i> representation of the Imagination,
and a rational Idea an <i>indemonstrable</i> concept of
Reason. It is assumed of both that they are not
generated without grounds, but (according to the
above explanation of an Idea in general) in
conformity with certain principles of the cognitive
faculties to which they belong (subjective principles
in the one case, objective in the other).</p>
<p><i>Concepts of the Understanding</i> must, as such,
always be demonstrable [if by demonstration we
understand, as in anatomy, merely <i>presentation</i>];<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101" id="FNanchor_101">101</a>
<i>i.e.</i> the object corresponding to them must always
be capable of being given in intuition (pure or
empirical); for thus alone could they become
cognitions. The concept of <i>magnitude</i> can be given
<i>a priori</i> in the intuition of space, <i>e.g.</i> of a right line,
etc.; the concept of <i>cause</i> in impenetrability, in the
collision of bodies, etc. Consequently both can be
authenticated by means of an empirical intuition, <i>i.e.</i>
the thought of them can be proved (demonstrated,
verified) by an example; and this must be possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
for otherwise we should not be certain that the concept
was not empty, <i>i.e.</i> devoid of any <i>Object</i>.</p>
<p>In Logic we ordinarily use the expressions
demonstrable or indemonstrable only in respect of
<i>propositions</i>, but these might be better designated by
the titles respectively of <i>mediately and immediately
certain</i> propositions; for pure Philosophy has also
propositions of both kinds, <i>i.e.</i> true propositions,
some of which are susceptible of proof and others
not. It can, as philosophy, prove them on <i>a priori</i>
grounds, but it cannot demonstrate them; unless
we wish to depart entirely from the proper meaning
of this word, according to which <i>to demonstrate</i>
(<i>ostendere</i>, <i>exhibere</i>) is equivalent to presenting a
concept in intuition (whether in proof or merely in
definition). If the intuition is <i>a priori</i> this is called
construction; but if it is empirical, then the Object
is displayed by means of which objective reality is
assured to the concept. Thus we say of an anatomist
that he demonstrates the human eye, if by
a dissection of this organ he makes intuitively
evident the concept which he has previously treated
discursively.</p>
<p>It hence follows that the rational concept of the
supersensible substrate of all phenomena in general,
or even of that which must be placed at the basis of
our arbitrary will in respect of the moral law, viz.
of transcendental freedom, is already, in kind, an
indemonstrable concept and a rational Idea; while
virtue is so, in degree. For there can be given in
experience, as regards its quality, absolutely nothing
corresponding to the former; whereas in the latter
case no empirical product attains to the degree of
that causality, which the rational Idea prescribes as
the rule.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
As in a rational Idea the <i>Imagination</i> with its
intuitions does not attain to the given concept, so in
an aesthetical Idea the <i>Understanding</i> by its concepts
never attains completely to that internal intuition
which the Imagination binds up with a given
representation. Since, now, to reduce a representation
of the Imagination to concepts is the same
thing as to <i>expound</i> it, the aesthetical Idea may be
called an <i>inexponible</i> representation of the Imagination
(in its free play). I shall have occasion in the
sequel to say something more of Ideas of this kind;
now I only note that both kinds of Ideas, rational
and aesthetical, must have their principles; and must
have them in Reason—the one in the objective,
the other in the subjective principles of its
employment.</p>
<p>We can consequently explain <i>genius</i> as the
faculty of <i>aesthetical Ideas</i>; by which at the same
time is shown the reason why in the products of
genius it is the nature (of the subject) and not a
premeditated purpose that gives the rule to the art
(of the production of the beautiful). For since the
beautiful must not be judged by concepts, but by
the purposive attuning of the Imagination to
agreement with the faculty of concepts in general, it
cannot be rule and precept which can serve as the
subjective standard of that aesthetical but unconditioned
purposiveness in beautiful art, that can
rightly claim to please every one. It can only be
that in the subject which is nature and cannot be
brought under rules or concepts, <i>i.e.</i> the supersensible
substrate of all his faculties (to which
no concept of the Understanding extends), and
consequently that with respect to which it is the
final purpose given by the intelligible [part] of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
nature to harmonise all our cognitive faculties.
Thus alone is it possible that there should be
<i>a priori</i> at the basis of this purposiveness, for which
we can prescribe no objective principle, a principle
subjective and yet of universal validity.</p>
<h6><i>Remark II.</i></h6>
<p>The following important remark occurs here:
There are <i>three kinds of Antinomies</i> of pure
Reason, which, however, all agree in this, that they
compel us to give up the otherwise very natural
hypothesis that objects of sense are things in
themselves, and force us to regard them merely as
phenomena, and to supply to them an intelligible
substrate (something supersensible of which the
concept is only an Idea, and supplies no proper
knowledge). Without such antinomies Reason
could never decide upon accepting a principle
narrowing so much the field of its speculation, and
could never bring itself to sacrifices by which so
many otherwise brilliant hopes must disappear.
For even now when, by way of compensation for
these losses, a greater field in a practical aspect
opens out before it, it appears not to be able without
grief to part from those hopes, and disengage itself
from its old attachment.</p>
<p>That there are three kinds of antinomies has its
ground in this, that there are three cognitive
faculties,—Understanding, Judgement, and Reason;
of which each (as a superior cognitive faculty) must
have its <i>a priori</i> principles. For Reason, in so far
as it judges of these principles and their use,
inexorably requires, in respect of them all, the unconditioned
for the given conditioned; and this
can never be found if we consider the sensible as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
belonging to things in themselves, and do not
rather supply to it, as mere phenomenon, something
supersensible (the intelligible substrate of nature
both external and internal) as the reality in itself
[Sache an sich selbst]. There are then: (1) <i>For
the cognitive faculty</i> an antinomy of Reason in
respect of the theoretical employment of the Understanding
extended to the unconditioned; (2) <i>for
the feeling of pleasure and pain</i> an antinomy of
Reason in respect of the aesthetical employment of
the Judgement; and (3) <i>for the faculty of desire</i> an
antinomy in respect of the practical employment of
the self-legislative Reason; so far as all these
faculties have their superior principles <i>a priori</i>, and,
in conformity with an inevitable requirement of
Reason, must judge and be able to determine their
Object, <i>unconditionally</i> according to those principles.</p>
<p>As for the two antinomies of the theoretical
and practical employment of the superior cognitive
faculties, we have already shown their <i>unavoidableness</i>,
if judgements of this kind are not referred to a
supersensible substrate of the given Objects, as
phenomena; and also the <i>possibility of their solution</i>,
as soon as this is done. And as for the
antinomies in the employment of the Judgement, in
conformity with the requirements of Reason, and
their solution which is here given, there are only
two ways of avoiding them. <i>Either</i>: we must deny
that any <i>a priori</i> principle lies at the basis of the
aesthetical judgement of taste; we must maintain that
all claim to necessary universal agreement is a groundless
and vain fancy, and that a judgement of taste
only deserves to be regarded as correct because <i>it
happens</i> that many people agree about it; and this,
not because we <i>assume</i> an <i>a priori</i> principle behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
this agreement, but because (as in the taste of the
palate) of the contingent similar organisation of the
different subjects. <i>Or</i>: we must assume that the
judgement of taste is really a disguised judgement
of Reason upon the perfection discovered in a thing
and the reference of the manifold in it to a purpose,
and is consequently only called aesthetical on
account of the confusion here attaching to our
reflection, although it is at bottom teleological. In
the latter case we could declare the solution of the
antinomies by means of transcendental Ideas to
be needless and without point, and thus could
harmonise these laws of taste with Objects of sense,
not as mere phenomena but as things in themselves.
But we have shown in several places in the exposition
of judgements of taste how little either of
these expedients will satisfy.</p>
<p>However, if it be granted that our deduction at
least proceeds by the right method, although it be
not yet plain enough in all its parts, three Ideas
manifest themselves. <i>First</i>, there is the Idea of
the supersensible in general, without any further
determination of it, as the substrate of nature.
<i>Secondly</i>, there is the Idea of the same as the
principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature
for our cognitive faculty. And <i>thirdly</i>, there is the
Idea of the same as the principle of the purposes
of freedom, and of the agreement of freedom with
its purposes in the moral sphere.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<h5 id="s58">§ 58. <i>Of the Idealism of the purposiveness of both
Nature and Art as the unique principle of
the aesthetical Judgement</i></h5></div></blockquote>
<p>To begin with, we can either place the principle
of taste in the fact that it always judges in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
with grounds which are empirical and therefore
are only given <i>a posteriori</i> by sense, or concede
that it judges on <i>a priori</i> grounds. The former
would be the <i>empiricism</i> of the Critique of Taste;
the latter its <i>rationalism</i>. According to the <i>former</i>
the Object of our satisfaction would not differ from
the <i>pleasant</i>; according to the latter, if the judgement
rests on definite concepts, it would not differ from
the <i>good</i>. Thus all <i>beauty</i> would be banished from
the world, and only a particular name, expressing
perhaps a certain mingling of the two above-named
kinds of satisfaction, would remain in its place. But
we have shown that there are also <i>a priori</i> grounds
of satisfaction which can subsist along with the
principle of rationalism, although they cannot be
comprehended in <i>definite concepts</i>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the rationalism of the principle
of taste is either that of the <i>realism</i> of the
purposiveness, or of its <i>idealism</i>. Because a judgement
of taste is not a cognitive judgement, and
beauty is not a characteristic of the Object, considered
in itself, the rationalism of the principle of
taste can never be placed in the fact that the purposiveness
in this judgement is thought as objective,
<i>i.e.</i> that the judgement theoretically, and therefore
also logically (although only in a confused way),
refers to the perfection of the Object. It only refers
<i>aesthetically</i> to the agreement of the representation
of the Object in the Imagination with the essential
principles of Judgement in general in the subject.
Consequently, even according to the principle of
rationalism, the judgement of taste and the distinction
between its realism and idealism can only be
settled thus. Either in the first case, this subjective
purposiveness is assumed as an actual (designed)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
<i>purpose</i> of nature (or art) harmonising with our Judgement;
or, in the second case, as a purposive harmony
with the needs of Judgement, in respect of
nature and its forms produced according to particular
laws, which shows itself, without purpose, spontaneously,
and contingently.</p>
<p>The beautiful formations in the kingdom of
organised nature speak loudly for the realism of the
aesthetical purposiveness of nature; since we might
assume that behind the production of the beautiful
there is an Idea of the beautiful in the producing
cause, viz. a <i>purpose</i> in respect of our Imagination.
Flowers, blossoms, even the shapes of entire plants;
the elegance of animal formations of all kinds,
unneeded for their proper use, but, as it were,
selected for our taste; especially the charming variety
so satisfying to the eye and the harmonious arrangement
of colours (in the pheasant, in shell-fish, in
insects, even in the commonest flowers), which, as
it only concerns the surface and not the figure of
these creations (though perhaps requisite in regard
of their internal purposes), seems to be entirely
designed for external inspection; these things give
great weight to that mode of explanation which
assumes actual purposes of nature for our aesthetical
Judgement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not only is Reason opposed
to this assumption in its maxims, which bid us always
avoid as far as possible unnecessary multiplication
of principles; but nature everywhere shows in its
free formations much mechanical tendency to the
productions of forms which seem, as it were, to be
made for the aesthetical exercise of our Judgement,
without affording the least ground for the supposition
that there is need of anything more than its mechanism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
merely as nature, according to which, without
any Idea lying at their root, they can be purposive
for our judgement. But I understand by <i>free formations</i>
of nature <i>those</i> whereby from a <i>fluid at rest</i>,
through the volatilisation or separation of a portion
of its constituents (sometimes merely of caloric), the
remainder in becoming solid assumes a definite
shape or tissue (figure or texture), which is different
according to the specific difference of the material,
but in the same material is constant. Here it is
always presupposed that we are speaking of a perfect
fluid, <i>i.e.</i> that the material in it is completely
dissolved, and that it is not a mere medley of solid
particles in a state of suspension.</p>
<p>Formation, then, takes place by a <i>shooting together</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> by a sudden solidification, not by a gradual
transition from the fluid to the solid state, but all
at once by a <i>saltus</i>; which transition is also called
<i>crystallisation</i>. The commonest example of this
kind of formation is the freezing of water, where
first icicles are produced, which combine at angles
of 60°, while others attach themselves to each vertex,
until it all becomes ice; and so that, while this is
going on, the water does not gradually become
viscous, but is as perfectly fluid as if its temperature
were far higher, although it is absolutely ice-cold.
The matter that disengages itself, which is dissipated
suddenly at the moment of solidification, is a considerable
quantum of caloric, the disappearance of
which, as it was only required for preserving
fluidity, leaves the new ice not in the least colder
than the water which shortly before was fluid.</p>
<p>Many salts, and also rocks, of a crystalline
figure, are produced thus from a species of earth
dissolved in water, we do not exactly know how.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Thus are formed the glandular configurations of
many minerals, the cubical sulphide of lead, the ruby
silver ore, etc., in all probability in water and by
the shooting together of particles, as they become
forced by some cause to dispense with this vehicle
and to unite in definite external shapes.</p>
<p>But also all kinds of matter, which have been
kept in a fluid state by heat, and have become
solid by cooling, show internally, when fractured, a
definite texture. This makes us judge that if their
own weight or the disturbance of the air had not
prevented it, they would also have exhibited on the
outer surface their specifically peculiar shapes. This
has been observed in some metals on their inner
surface, which have been hardened externally by
fusion but are fluid in the interior, by the drawing
off the internal fluid and the consequent undisturbed
crystallisation of the remainder. Many of these
mineral crystallisations, such as spars, hematite,
arragonite, etc., often present beautiful shapes, the
like of which art can only conceive; and the halo
in the cavern of Antiparos<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102" id="FNanchor_102">102</a> is merely produced by
water trickling down strata of gypsum.</p>
<p>The fluid state is, to all appearance, older than
the solid state, and plants as well as animal bodies
are fashioned out of fluid nutritive matter, so far
as this forms itself in a state of rest. This last of
course primarily combines and forms itself in freedom
according to a certain original disposition directed
towards purposes (which, as will be shown in Part
II., must not be judged aesthetically but teleologically
according to the principle of realism),
but also perhaps in conformity with the universal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
law of the affinity of materials. Again, the watery
fluids dissolved in an atmosphere that is a mixture
of different gases, if they separate from the latter
on account of cooling, produce snow figures, which
in correspondence with the character of the special
mixture of gases, often seem very artistic and are
extremely beautiful. So, without detracting from
the teleological principle by which we judge of
organisation, we may well think that the beauty of
flowers, of the plumage of birds, or of shell-fish,
both in shape and colour, may be ascribed to nature
and its faculty of producing forms in an aesthetically
purposive way, in its freedom, without particular
purposes adapted thereto, according to chemical
laws by the arrangement of the material requisite
for the organisation in question.</p>
<p>But what shows the principle of the <i>Ideality</i> of
the purposiveness in the beauty of nature, as that
which we always place at the basis of an aesthetical
judgement, and which allows us to employ, as a
ground of explanation for our representative faculty,
no realism of purpose, is the fact that in judging
beauty we invariably seek its gauge in ourselves
<i>a priori</i>, and that our aesthetical Judgement is itself
legislative in respect of the judgement whether
anything is beautiful or not. This could not be, on
the assumption of the Realism of the purposiveness
of nature; because in that case we must have
learned from nature what we ought to find beautiful,
and the aesthetical judgement would be subjected to
empirical principles. For in such an act of judging
the important point is not, what nature is, or even,
as a purpose, is in relation to us, but how we take
it. There would be an objective purposiveness in
nature if it had fashioned its forms for our satisfaction;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and not a subjective purposiveness which
depended upon the play of the Imagination in its
freedom, where it is we who receive nature with
favour, not nature which shows us favour. The
property of nature that gives us occasion to perceive
the inner purposiveness in the relation of our
mental faculties in judging certain of its products—a
purposiveness which is to be explained on
supersensible grounds as necessary and universal—cannot
be a natural purpose or be judged by us as
such; for otherwise the judgement hereby determined
would not be free, and would have at its basis
heteronomy, and not, as beseems a judgement of
taste, autonomy.</p>
<p>In beautiful Art the principle of the Idealism of
purposiveness is still clearer. As in the case of the
beautiful in Nature, an aesthetical Realism of this
purposiveness cannot be perceived by sensations
(for then the art would be only pleasant, not beautiful).
But that the satisfaction produced by aesthetical
Ideas must not depend on the attainment of definite
purposes (as in mechanically designed art), and that
consequently, in the very rationalism of the principle,
the ideality of the purposes and not their reality
must be fundamental, appears from the fact that
beautiful Art, as such, must not be considered as a
product of Understanding and Science, but of Genius,
and therefore must get its rule through <i>aesthetical</i>
Ideas, which are essentially different from rational
Ideas of definite purposes.</p>
<p>Just as the <i>ideality</i> of the objects of sense as
phenomena is the only way of explaining the possibility
of their forms being susceptible of <i>a priori</i>
determination, so the <i>idealism</i> of purposiveness, in
judging the beautiful in nature and art, is the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
hypothesis under which Criticism can explain the
possibility of a judgement of taste which demands
<i>a priori</i> validity for every one (without grounding
on concepts the purposiveness that is represented in
the Object).</p>
<h5 id="s59">§ 59. <i>Of Beauty as the symbol of Morality</i></h5>
<p>Intuitions are always required to establish the
reality of our concepts. If the concepts are empirical,
the intuitions are called <i>examples</i>. If they are
pure concepts of Understanding, the intuitions are
called <i>schemata</i>. If we desire to establish the
objective reality of rational concepts, <i>i.e.</i> of Ideas,
on behalf of theoretical cognition, then we are asking
for something impossible, because absolutely no intuition
can be given which shall be adequate to
them.</p>
<p>All <i>hypotyposis</i> (presentation, <i>subjectio sub adspectum</i>),
or sensible illustration, is twofold. It is
either <i>schematical</i>, when to a concept comprehended
by the Understanding the corresponding intuition is
given <i>a priori</i>; or it is <i>symbolical</i>. In the latter case
to a concept only thinkable by the Reason, to which
no sensible intuition can be adequate, an intuition is
supplied with which accords a procedure of the Judgement
analogous to what it observes in schematism:
it accords with it, that is, in respect of the rule of
this procedure merely, not of the intuition itself;
consequently in respect of the form of reflection
merely, and not of its content.</p>
<p>There is a use of the word <i>symbolical</i> that has
been adopted by modern logicians, which is misleading
and incorrect, <i>i.e.</i> to speak of the <i>symbolical</i>
mode of representation as if it were opposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
<i>intuitive</i>; for the symbolical is only a mode of the
intuitive. The latter (the intuitive), that is, may
be divided into the <i>schematical</i> and the <i>symbolical</i>
modes of representation. Both are hypotyposes, <i>i.e.</i>
presentations (<i>exhibitiones</i>); not mere <i>characterisations</i>,
or designations of concepts by accompanying
sensible signs which contain nothing belonging to
the intuition of the Object, and only serve as a
means for reproducing the concepts, according to
the law of association of the Imagination, and consequently
in a subjective point of view. These are
either words, or visible (algebraical, even mimetical)
signs, as mere expressions for concepts.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103" id="FNanchor_103">103</a></p>
<p>All intuitions, which we supply to concepts <i>a
priori</i>, are therefore either <i>schemata</i> or <i>symbols</i>, of
which the former contain direct, the latter indirect,
presentations of the concept. The former do this
demonstratively; the latter by means of an analogy
(for which we avail ourselves even of empirical
intuitions) in which the Judgement exercises a double
function; first applying the concept to the object
of a sensible intuition, and then applying the mere
rule of the reflection made upon that intuition to a
quite different object of which the first is only the
symbol. Thus a monarchical state is represented
by a living body, if it is governed by national
laws, and by a mere machine (like a hand-mill) if
governed by an individual absolute will; but in both
cases only <i>symbolically</i>. For between a despotic
state and a hand-mill there is, to be sure, no similarity;
but there is a similarity in the rules according
to which we reflect upon these two things and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
causality. This matter has not been sufficiently
analysed hitherto, for it deserves a deeper investigation;
but this is not the place to linger over it. Our
language [<i>i.e.</i> German] is full of indirect presentations
of this sort, in which the expression does not
contain the proper schema for the concept, but
merely a symbol for reflection. Thus the words
<i>ground</i> (support, basis), <i>to depend</i> (to be held up from
above), to <i>flow</i> from something (instead of, to follow),
<i>substance</i> (as <i>Locke</i> expresses it, the support of
accidents), and countless others, are not schematical
but symbolical hypotyposes and expressions for concepts,
not by means of a direct intuition, but only
by analogy with it, <i>i.e.</i> by the transference of reflection
upon an object of intuition to a quite different
concept to which perhaps an intuition can never
directly correspond. If we are to give the name of
cognition to a mere mode of representation (which
is quite permissible if the latter is not a principle of
the theoretical determination of what an object is in
itself, but of the practical determination of what the
Idea of it should be for us and for its purposive use),
then all our knowledge of God is merely symbolical;
and he who regards it as schematical, along with the
properties of Understanding, Will, etc., which only
establish their objective reality in beings of this
world, falls into Anthropomorphism, just as he who
gives up every intuitive element falls into Deism, by
which nothing at all is cognised, not even in a
practical point of view.</p>
<p>Now I say the Beautiful is the symbol of the
morally Good, and that it is only in this respect (a
reference which is natural to every man and which
every man postulates in others as a duty) that it
gives pleasure with a claim for the agreement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
every one else. By this the mind is made conscious
of a certain ennoblement and elevation above the
mere sensibility to pleasure received through sense,
and the worth of others is estimated in accordance
with a like maxim of their Judgement. That is the
<i>intelligible</i>, to which, as pointed out in the preceding
paragraph, Taste looks; with which our higher
cognitive faculties are in accord; and without which
a downright contradiction would arise between their
nature and the claims made by taste. In this
faculty the Judgement does not see itself, as in empirical
judging, subjected to a heteronomy of empirical
laws; it gives the law to itself in respect of the
objects of so pure a satisfaction, just as the Reason
does in respect of the faculty of desire. Hence,
both on account of this inner possibility in the
subject and of the external possibility of a nature
that agrees with it, it finds itself to be referred to
something within the subject as well as without him,
something which is neither nature nor freedom, but
which yet is connected with the supersensible ground
of the latter. In this supersensible ground, therefore,
the theoretical faculty is bound together in
unity with the practical, in a way which though
common is yet unknown. We shall indicate some
points of this analogy, while at the same time we
shall note the differences.</p>
<p>(1) The beautiful pleases <i>immediately</i> (but only
in reflective intuition, not, like morality, in its
concept). (2) It pleases <i>apart from any interest</i>
(the morally good is indeed necessarily bound up
with an interest, though not with one which precedes
the judgement upon the satisfaction, but with one
which is first of all produced by it). (3) The
<i>freedom</i> of the Imagination (and therefore of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
sensibility of our faculty) is represented in judging
the beautiful as harmonious with the conformity to
law of the Understanding (in the moral judgement
the freedom of the will is thought as the harmony
of the latter with itself according to universal laws
of Reason). (4) The subjective principle in judging
the beautiful is represented as <i>universal</i>, <i>i.e.</i> as valid
for every man, though not cognisable through any
universal concept. (The objective principle of morality
is also expounded as universal, <i>i.e.</i> for every
subject and for every action of the same subject, and
thus as cognisable by means of a universal concept).
Hence the moral judgement is not only susceptible of
definite constitutive principles, but is possible <i>only</i> by
grounding its maxims on these in their universality.</p>
<p>A reference to this analogy is usual even with
the common Understanding [of men], and we often
describe beautiful objects of nature or art by names
that seem to put a moral appreciation at their basis.
We call buildings or trees majestic and magnificent,
landscapes laughing and gay; even colours are
called innocent, modest, tender, because they excite
sensations which have something analogous to the
consciousness of the state of mind brought about
by moral judgements. Taste makes possible the
transition, without any violent leap, from the charm
of Sense to habitual moral interest; for it represents
the Imagination in its freedom as capable of purposive
determination for the Understanding, and so
teaches us to find even in objects of sense a free
satisfaction apart from any charm of sense.</p>

<h5 class="vspace" id="s60">APPENDIX<br>§ 60. <i>Of the method of Taste</i></h5>
<p>The division of a Critique into Elementology
and Methodology, as preparatory to science, is not
applicable to the Critique of taste, because there
neither is nor can be a science of the Beautiful,
and the judgement of taste is not determinable by
means of principles. As for the scientific element
in every art, which regards <i>truth</i> in the presentation
of its Object, this is indeed the indispensable
condition (<i>conditio sine qua non</i>) of beautiful art,
but not beautiful art itself. There is therefore for
beautiful art only a <i>manner</i> (<i>modus</i>), not a <i>method
of teaching</i> (<i>methodus</i>). The master must show
what the pupil is to do and how he is to do it; and
the universal rules, under which at last he brings
his procedure, serve rather for bringing the main
points back to his remembrance when occasion
requires, than for prescribing them to him. Nevertheless
regard must be had here to a certain ideal,
which art must have before its eyes, although it
cannot be completely attained in practice. It is
only through exciting the Imagination of the pupil
to accordance with a given concept, by making him
note the inadequacy of the expression for the Idea,
to which the concept itself does not attain because
it is an aesthetical Idea, and by severe criticism, that
he can be prevented from taking the examples set
before him as types and models for imitation, to
be subjected to no higher standard or independent
judgement. It is thus that genius, and with it the
freedom of the Imagination, is stifled by its very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
conformity to law; and without these no beautiful
art, and not even an accurately judging individual
taste, is possible.</p>
<p>The propaedeutic to all beautiful art, regarded in
the highest degree of its perfection, seems to lie,
not in precepts, but in the culture of the mental
powers by means of those elements of knowledge
called <i>humaniora</i>, probably because <i>humanity</i> on the
one side indicates the universal <i>feeling of sympathy</i>,
and on the other the faculty of being able to <i>communicate</i>
universally our inmost [feelings]. For
these properties taken together constitute the characteristic
social spirit<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104" id="FNanchor_104">104</a> of humanity by which it is
distinguished from the limitations of animal life.
The age and peoples, in which the impulse towards
a <i>law-abiding</i> social life, by which a people becomes
a permanent community, contended with the great
difficulties presented by the difficult problem of
uniting freedom (and therefore equality also) with
compulsion (rather of respect and submission from a
sense of duty than of fear)—such an age and such a
people naturally first found out the art of reciprocal
communication of Ideas between the cultivated and
uncultivated classes and thus discovered how to
harmonise the large-mindedness and refinement of
the former with the natural simplicity and originality
of the latter. In this way they first found that
mean between the higher culture and simple nature
which furnishes that true standard for taste as a
sense common to all men which no universal rules
can supply.</p>
<p>With difficulty will a later age dispense with
those models, because it will be always farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
from nature; and in fine, without having permanent
examples before it, a concept will hardly be possible,
in one and the same people, of the happy union of
the law-abiding constraint of the highest culture with
the force and truth of free nature which feels its own
proper worth.</p>
<p>Now taste is at bottom a faculty for judging of
the sensible illustration of moral Ideas (by means
of a certain analogy involved in our reflection upon
both these); and it is from this faculty also and
from the greater susceptibility grounded thereon
for the feeling arising from the latter (called moral
feeling), that the pleasure is derived which taste
regards as valid for mankind in general and not
merely for the private feeling of each. Hence
it appears plain that the true propaedeutic for the
foundation of taste is the development of moral
Ideas and the culture of the moral feeling; because
it is only when sensibility is brought into agreement
with this that genuine taste can assume a definite
invariable form.</p>

<span class="subhead">CRITIQUE OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s61">§ 61. <i>Of the objective purposiveness of Nature</i></h5>
<p>We have on transcendental principles good
ground to assume a subjective purposiveness in
nature, in its particular laws, in reference to its
comprehensibility by human Judgement and to the
possibility of the connexion of particular experiences
in a system. This may be expected as possible in
many products of nature, which, as if they were
devised quite specially for our Judgement, contain
a specific form conformable thereto; which through
their manifoldness and unity serve at once to
strengthen and to sustain the mental powers (that
come into play in the employment of this faculty);
and to which therefore we give the name of <i>beautiful</i>
forms.</p>
<p>But that the things of nature serve one another
as means to purposes, and that their possibility is
only completely intelligible through this kind of
causality—for this we have absolutely no ground in
the universal Idea of nature, as the complex of the
objects of sense. In the above-mentioned case, the
representation of things, because it is something in
ourselves, can be quite well thought <i>a priori</i> as
suitable and useful for the internally purposive
determination of our cognitive faculties; but that
purposes, which neither are our own nor belong to
nature (for we do not regard nature as an intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
being), could or should constitute a particular kind of
causality, at least a quite special conformity to law,—this
we have absolutely no <i>a priori</i> reason for
presuming. Yet more, experience itself cannot prove
to us the actuality of this; there must then have
preceded a rationalising subtlety which only sportively
introduces the concept of purpose into the
nature of things, but which does not derive it from
Objects or from their empirical cognition. To this
latter it is of more service to make nature comprehensible
according to analogy with the subjective
ground of the connexion of our representations,
than to cognise it from objective grounds.</p>
<p>Further, objective purposiveness, as a principle
of the possibility of things of nature, is so far removed
from <i>necessary</i> connexion with the concept
of nature, that it is much oftener precisely that upon
which one relies to prove the contingency of nature
and of its form. When, <i>e.g.</i> we adduce the structure
of a bird, the hollowness of its bones, the
disposition of its wings for motion and of its tail for
steering, <i>etc.</i>, we say that all this is contingent in the
highest degree according to the mere <i>nexus effectivus</i>
of nature, without calling in the aid of a particular
kind of causality, namely that of purpose (<i>nexus
finalis</i>). In other words, nature, considered as mere
mechanism, could have produced its forms in a
thousand other ways without stumbling upon the
unity which is in accordance with such a principle.
It is not in the concept of nature but quite apart
from it that we can hope to find the least ground
<i>a priori</i> for this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the teleological act of judgement is
rightly brought to bear, at least problematically,
upon the investigation of nature; but only in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to bring it under principles of observation and
inquiry according to the <i>analogy</i> with the causality
of purpose, without any pretence to <i>explain</i> it thereby.
It belongs therefore to the reflective and not
to the determinant judgement. The concept of combinations
and forms of nature in accordance with
purposes is then at least <i>one principle more</i> for
bringing its phenomena under rules where the laws
of simply mechanical causality do not suffice. For
we bring in a teleological ground, where we attribute
causality in respect of an Object to the concept of
an Object, as if it were to be found in nature (not
in ourselves); or rather when we represent to ourselves
the possibility of the Object after the analogy
of that causality which we experience in ourselves,
and consequently think nature technically as through
a special faculty. If we did not ascribe to it such
a method of action, its causality would have to be
represented as blind mechanism. If, on the contrary,
we supply to nature causes acting <i>designedly</i>,
and consequently place at its basis teleology,
not merely as a <i>regulative</i> principle for the mere
<i>judging</i> of phenomena, to which nature can be
thought as subject in its particular laws, but as a
<i>constitutive</i> principle of the <i>derivation</i> of its products
from their causes; then would the concept of a
natural purpose no longer belong to the reflective
but to the determinant Judgement. Then, in fact, it
would not belong specially to the Judgement (like
the concept of beauty regarded as formal subjective
purposiveness), but as a rational concept it would
introduce into natural science a new causality,
which we only borrow from ourselves and ascribe
to other beings, without meaning to assume them
to be of the same kind with ourselves.</p>

<span class="subhead">ANALYTIC OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT</span></h3>
<h5 id="s62">§ 62. <i>Of the objective purposiveness which is merely
formal as distinguished from that which is material</i></h5>
<p>All geometrical figures drawn on a principle
display a manifold, oft admired, objective purposiveness;
<i>i.e.</i> in reference to their usefulness for the
solution of several problems by a single principle,
or of the same problem in an infinite variety of
ways. The purposiveness is here obviously objective
and intellectual, not merely subjective and
aesthetical. For it expresses the suitability of the
figure for the production of many intended figures,
and is cognised through Reason. But this purposiveness
does not make the concept of the object
itself possible, <i>i.e.</i> it is not regarded as possible
merely with reference to this use.</p>
<p>In so simple a figure as the circle lies the key
to the solution of a multitude of problems, each of
which would demand various appliances; whereas
the solution results of itself, as it were, as one of
the infinite number of elegant properties of this
figure. Are we, for example, asked to construct a
triangle, being given the base and vertical angle?
The problem is indeterminate, <i>i.e.</i> it can be solved
in an infinite number of ways. But the circle
embraces them altogether as the geometrical locus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of the vertices of triangles satisfying the given
conditions. Again, suppose that two lines are to
cut one another so that the rectangle under the
segments of the one should be equal to the rectangle
under the segments of the other; the solution
of the problem from this point of view presents
much difficulty. But all chords intersecting inside
a circle divide one another in this <i>proportion</i>. Other
curved lines suggest other purposive solutions of
which nothing was thought in the rule that furnished
their construction. All conic sections in themselves
and when compared with one another are fruitful
in principles for the solution of a number of possible
problems, however simple is the definition which
determines their concept.—It is a true joy to see
the zeal with which the old geometers investigated
the properties of lines of this class, without allowing
themselves to be led astray by the questions of narrow-minded
persons, as to what use this knowledge
would be. Thus they worked out the properties of
the parabola without knowing the law of gravitation,
which would have suggested to them its application
to the trajectory of heavy bodies (for the motion of
a heavy body can be seen to be parallel to the curve
of a parabola). Again, they found out the properties
of an ellipse without surmising that any of the
heavenly bodies had weight, and without knowing
the law of force at different distances from the point
of attraction, which causes it to describe this curve
in free motion. While they thus unconsciously
worked for the science of the future, they delighted
themselves with a purposiveness in the [essential]
being of things which yet they were able to present
completely <i>a priori</i> in its necessity. <i>Plato</i>, himself
master of this science, hinted at such an original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
constitution of things in the discovery of which we
can dispense with all experience, and at the power
of the mind to produce from its supersensible principle
the harmony of beings (where the properties
of number come in, with which the mind plays in
music). This [he touches upon] in the inspiration
that raised him above the concepts of experience to
Ideas, which seem to him to be explicable only
through an intellectual affinity with the origin of all
beings. No wonder that he banished from his
school the man who was ignorant of geometry, since
he thought he could derive from pure intuition,
which has its home in the human spirit, that which
<i>Anaxagoras</i> drew from empirical objects and their
purposive combination. For in the very necessity
of that which is purposive, and is constituted just as
if it were designedly intended for our use,—but at
the same time seems to belong originally to the
being of things without any reference to our use—lies
the ground of our great admiration of nature,
and that not so much external as in our own Reason.
It is surely excusable that this admiration should
through misunderstanding gradually rise to the
height of fanaticism.</p>
<p>But this intellectual purposiveness, although no
doubt objective (not subjective like aesthetical
purposiveness), is in reference to its possibility
merely formal (not real). It can only be conceived
as purposiveness in general without any [definite]
purpose being assumed as its basis, and consequently
without teleology being needed for it. The figure of
a circle is an intuition which is determined by means
of the Understanding according to a principle.
The unity of this principle which I arbitrarily
assume and use as fundamental concept, applied to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
a form of intuition (space) which is met with in
myself as a representation and yet <i>a priori</i>, renders
intelligible the unity of many rules resulting from
the construction of that concept, which are purposive
for many possible designs. But this purposiveness
does not imply a <i>purpose</i> or any other ground whatever.
It is quite different if I meet with order and
regularity in complexes of <i>things</i>, external to myself,
enclosed within certain boundaries; as, <i>e.g.</i> in
a garden, the order and regularity of the trees,
flower-beds, and walks. These I cannot expect to
derive <i>a priori</i> from my bounding of space made
after a rule of my own; for this order and regularity
are existing things which must be given empirically
in order to be known, and not a mere representation
in myself determined <i>a priori</i> according to a principle.
So then the latter (empirical) purposiveness,
as <i>real</i>, is dependent on the concept of a purpose.</p>
<p>But the ground of admiration for a perceived
purposiveness, although it be in the being of things
(so far as their concepts can be constructed), may
very well be seen, and seen to be legitimate.
The manifold rules whose unity (derived from a
principle) excites admiration, are all synthetical
and do not follow from the <i>concept</i> of the Object,
<i>e.g.</i> of a circle; but require this Object to be given
in intuition. Hence this unity gets the appearance
of having empirically an external basis of rules
distinct from our representative faculty; as if therefore
the correspondence of the Object to that need
of rules which is proper to the Understanding were
contingent in itself, and therefore only possible
by means of a purpose expressly directed thereto.
Now because this harmony, notwithstanding all this
purposiveness, is not cognised empirically but <i>a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
priori</i>, it should bring us of itself to this point—that
space, through whose determination (by means
of the Imagination, in accordance with a concept)
the Object is alone possible, is not a characteristic
of things external to me, but a mere mode of representation
in myself. Hence, in the figure which I
draw <i>in conformity with a concept</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in my own
mode of representing that which is given to me
externally, whatever it may be in itself, <i>it is I that
introduce the purposiveness</i>; I get no empirical instruction
from the Object about the purposiveness,
and so I require in it no particular purpose external
to myself. But because this consideration already
calls for a critical employment of Reason, and consequently
cannot be involved in the judging of the
Object according to its properties; so this latter
[judging] suggests to me immediately nothing but
the unification of heterogeneous rules (even according
to their very diversity) in a principle. This
principle, without requiring any particular <i>a priori</i>
basis external to my concept, or indeed, generally
speaking, to my representation, is yet cognised
<i>a priori</i> by me as true. Now <i>wonder</i> is a shock of
the mind arising from the incompatibility of a
representation, and the rule given by its means,
with the principles already lying at its basis; which
provokes a doubt as to whether we have rightly
seen or rightly judged. <i>Admiration</i>, however, is
wonder which ever recurs, despite the disappearance
of this doubt. Consequently the latter is a quite
natural effect of that observed purposiveness in the
being of things (as phenomena). It cannot indeed
be censured, whilst the unification of the form of
sensible intuition (space)—with the faculty of concepts
(the Understanding)—is inexplicable to us;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
and that not only on account of the union being
just of the kind that it is, but because it is enlarging
for the mind to surmise [the existence of]
something lying outside our sensible representations
in which, although unknown to us, the ultimate
ground of that agreement may be met with. We
are, it is true, not necessitated to cognise this if we
have only to do <i>a priori</i> with the formal purposiveness
of our representations; but the fact that we
are compelled to look out beyond it inspires at the
same time an admiration for the object that impels
us thereto.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to speak of the above-mentioned
properties of geometrical figures or of
numbers as <i>beautiful</i>, on account of a certain <i>a priori</i>
purposiveness they have for all kinds of cognitive
uses, this purposiveness being quite unexpected on
account of the simplicity of the construction. We
speak, <i>e.g.</i> of this or that <i>beautiful</i> property of the
circle, which was discovered in this or that way.
But there is no aesthetical act of judgement through
which we find it purposive, no act of judgement
without a concept which renders noticeable a mere
<i>subjective</i> purposiveness in the free play of our
cognitive faculties; but an intellectual act according
to concepts which enables us clearly to cognise an
objective purposiveness, <i>i.e.</i> availableness for all
kinds of (infinitely manifold) purposes. We must
rather call this <i>relative perfection</i> than a beauty of
the mathematical figure. To speak thus of an <i>intellectual
beauty</i> cannot in general be permissible;
for otherwise the word beauty would lose all determinate
significance, or the intellectual satisfaction
all superiority over the sensible. We should rather
call a <i>demonstration</i> of such properties beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
because through it the Understanding as the faculty
of concepts, and the Imagination as the faculty of
presenting them, feel themselves strengthened <i>a
priori</i>. (This, when viewed in connexion with the
precision introduced by Reason, is spoken of as
elegant.) Here, however, the satisfaction, although
it is based on concepts, is subjective; while perfection
brings with itself an objective satisfaction.</p>
<h5 id="s63">§ 63. <i>Of the relative, as distinguished from the
inner, purposiveness of nature</i></h5>
<p>Experience leads our Judgement to the concept of
an objective and material purposiveness, <i>i.e.</i> to the
concept of a purpose of nature, only when<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105" id="FNanchor_105">105</a> we have
to judge of a relation of cause to effect which we
find ourselves able to apprehend as legitimate only
by presupposing the Idea of the effect of the
causality of the cause as the fundamental condition,
in the cause, of the possibility of the effect.
This can take place in two ways. We may regard
the effect directly as an art product, or only as
material for the art of other possible natural beings;
in other words, either as a purpose or as a means
towards the purposive employment of other causes.
This latter purposiveness is called utility (for man)
or mere advantage (for other creatures), and is
merely relative; while the former is an inner purposiveness
of the natural being.</p>
<p>For example, rivers bring down with them all
kinds of earth serviceable for the growth of plants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
which sometimes is deposited inland, often also at
their mouths. The tide brings this mud to many
coasts over the land or deposits it on the shore;
and so, more especially if men give their aid so
that the ebb shall not carry it back again, the fruit-bearing
land increases in area, and the vegetable
kingdom gains the place which formerly was the
habitation of fish and shells. In this way has nature
itself brought about most of the extensions of the
land, and still continues to do so, although very
slowly.—Now the question is whether this is to
be judged a purpose of nature, because it contains
utility for men. We cannot put it down to the
account of the vegetable kingdom, because just as
much is subtracted from sea-life as is added to
land-life.</p>
<p>Or, to give an example of the advantageousness
of certain natural things as means for other creatures
(if we suppose them to be means), no soil is more
suitable to pine trees than a sandy soil. Now the
deep sea, before it withdrew from the land, left
behind large tracts of sand in our northern regions,
so that on this soil, so unfavourable for all cultivation,
widely extended pine forests were enabled to
grow, for the unreasoning destruction of which
we frequently blame our ancestors. We may ask if
this original deposit of tracts of sand was a purpose
of nature for the benefit of the possible pine forests?
So much is clear, that if we regard this as a purpose
of nature, we must also regard the sand as a
relative purpose, in reference to which the ocean
strand and its withdrawal were means: for in the
series of the mutually subordinated members of a
purposive combination, every member must be
regarded as a purpose (though not as a final<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
purpose), to which its proximate cause is the means.
So too if cattle, sheep, horses, etc., are to exist,
there must be grass on the earth, but there must
also be saline plants in the desert if camels are to
thrive; and again these and other herbivorous
animals must be met with in numbers if there
are to be wolves, tigers, and lions. Consequently
the objective purposiveness, which is based upon
advantage, is not an objective purposiveness of
things in themselves; as if the sand could not be
conceived for itself as an effect of a cause, viz. the
sea, without attributing to the latter a purpose, and
regarding the effect, namely, the sand, as a work
of art. It is a merely relative purposiveness contingent
upon the thing to which it is ascribed;
and although in the examples we have cited, the
different kinds of grass are to be judged as in
themselves organised products of nature, and consequently
as artificial, yet are they to be regarded,
in reference to the beasts which feed upon them, as
mere raw material.</p>
<p>But above all, though man, through the freedom
of his causality, finds certain natural things of
advantage for his designs—designs often foolish,
such as using the variegated plumage of birds to
adorn his clothes, or coloured earths and the juices
of plants for painting his face; often again reasonable
as when the horse is used for riding, the ox
or (as in Minorca) the ass or pig for ploughing—yet
we cannot even here assume a relative natural
purpose. For his Reason knows how to give things
a conformity with his own arbitrary fancies for which
he was not at all predestined by nature. Only, <i>if</i>
we assume that men are to live upon the earth, then
the means must be there without which they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
not exist as animals, and even as rational animals
(in however low a degree of rationality); and thereupon
those natural things, which are indispensable in
this regard, must be considered as natural purposes.</p>
<p>We can hence easily see that external purposiveness
(advantage of one thing in respect of others)
can be regarded as an external natural purpose only
under the condition, that the existence of that
[being], to which it is immediately or distantly
advantageous, is in itself a purpose of nature.
Since that can never be completely determined by
mere contemplation of nature, it follows that relative
purposiveness, although it hypothetically gives
indications of natural purposes, yet justifies no
absolute teleological judgement.</p>
<p>Snow in cold countries protects the crops from
the frost; it makes human intercourse easier (by
means of sleighs). The Laplander finds in his
country animals by whose aid this intercourse is
brought about, <i>i.e.</i> reindeer, who find sufficient
sustenance in a dry moss which they have to
scratch out for themselves from under the snow,
and who are easily tamed and readily permit themselves
to be deprived of that freedom in which they
could have remained if they chose. For other
people in the same frozen regions marine animals
afford rich stores; in addition to the food and
clothing which are thus supplied, and the wood
which is floated in by the sea to their dwellings,
these marine animals provide material for fuel by
which their huts are warmed. Here is a wonderful
concurrence of many references of nature to one
purpose; and all this applies to the cases of the
Greenlander, the Lapp, the Samoyede, the inhabitant
of Yakutsk, etc. But then we do not see why,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
generally, men must live there at all. Therefore to say
that vapour falls out of the atmosphere in the form of
snow, that the sea has its currents which float down
wood that has grown in warmer lands, and that
there are in it great sea monsters filled with oil,
<i>because</i> the idea of advantage for certain poor
creatures is fundamental for the cause which collects
all these natural products, would be a very venturesome
and arbitrary judgement. For even if there
were none of this natural utility, we should miss
nothing as regards the adequateness of natural
causes to nature’s constitution; much more even to
desire such a tendency in, and to attribute such a
purpose to, nature would be the part of a presumptuous
and inconsiderate fancy. For indeed it might
be observed that it could only have been the greatest
unsociability among men which thus scattered
them into such inhospitable regions.</p>
<h5 id="s64">§ 64. <i>Of the peculiar character of things as
natural purposes</i></h5>
<p>In order to see that a thing is only possible as a
purpose, that is, to be forced to seek the causality of
its origin not in the mechanism of nature but in a
cause whose faculty of action is determined through
concepts, it is requisite that its form be not possible
according to mere natural laws, <i>i.e.</i> laws which can
be cognised by us through the Understanding alone
when applied to objects of Sense; but that even the
empirical knowledge of it as regards its cause and
effect presupposes concepts of Reason. This <i>contingency</i>
of its form in all empirical natural laws in
reference to Reason affords a ground for regarding
its causality as possible only through Reason. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Reason, which must cognise the necessity of every
form of a natural product in order to comprehend
even the conditions of its genesis, cannot assume
such [natural] necessity in that particular given form.
The causality of its origin is then referred to the
faculty of acting in accordance with purposes (a
will); and the Object which can only thus be represented
as possible is represented as a purpose.</p>
<p>If in a seemingly uninhabited country a man
perceived a geometrical figure, say a regular hexagon,
inscribed on the sand, his reflection busied with such
a concept would attribute, although obscurely, the
unity in the principle of its genesis to Reason, and
consequently would not regard as a ground of the
possibility of such a shape the sand, or the neighbouring
sea, or the winds, or beasts with familiar
footprints, or any other irrational cause. For the
chance against meeting with such a concept, which
is only possible through Reason, would seem so
infinitely great, that it would be just as if there were
no natural law, no cause in the mere mechanical
working of nature capable of producing it; but as
if only the concept of such an Object, as a concept
which Reason alone can supply and with which it
can compare the thing, could contain the causality
for such an effect. This then would be regarded as
a purpose, but as a product of <i>art</i>, not as a natural
purpose (<i>vestigium hominis video</i>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_106" id="FNanchor_106">106</a></p>
<p>But in order to regard a thing cognised as a
natural product as a purpose also—consequently as a
<i>natural purpose</i>, if this is not a contradiction—something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
more is required. I would say provisionally:
a thing exists as a natural purpose, if it is [although
in a double sense]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_107" id="FNanchor_107">107</a> both <i>cause and effect of itself</i>.
For herein lies a causality the like of which cannot
be combined with the mere concept of a nature without
attributing to it a purpose; it can certainly be
thought without contradiction, but cannot be comprehended.
We shall elucidate the determination
of this Idea of a natural purpose by an example,
before we analyse it completely.</p>
<p>In the first place, a tree generates another tree
according to a known natural law. But the tree
produced is of the same genus; and so it produces
itself <i>generically</i>. On the one hand, as effect it
is continually self-produced; on the other hand, as
cause it continually produces itself, and so perpetuates
itself generically.</p>
<p>Secondly, a tree produces itself as an <i>individual</i>.
This kind of effect no doubt we call growth; but
it is quite different from any increase according to
mechanical laws, and is to be reckoned as generation,
though under another name. The matter that the
tree incorporates it previously works up into a specifically
peculiar quality, which natural mechanism external
to it cannot supply; and thus it develops itself
by aid of a material which, as compounded, is its own
product. No doubt, as regards the constituents got
from nature without, it must only be regarded as
an educt; but yet in the separation and recombination
of this raw material we see such an originality
in the separating and formative faculty of this kind
of natural being, as is infinitely beyond the reach
of art, if the attempt is made to reconstruct such
vegetable products out of elements obtained by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
their dissection or material supplied by nature for
their sustenance.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, each part of a tree generates itself in
such a way that the maintenance of any one part
depends reciprocally on the maintenance of the rest.
A bud of one tree engrafted on the twig of another
produces in the alien stock a plant of its own kind,
and so also a scion engrafted on a foreign stem.
Hence we may regard each twig or leaf of the same
tree as merely engrafted or inoculated into it, and
so as an independent tree attached to another and
parasitically nourished by it. At the same time,
while the leaves are products of the tree they also in
turn give support to it; for the repeated defoliation
of a tree kills it, and its growth thus depends on
the action of the leaves upon the stem. The self-help
of nature in case of injury in the vegetable
creation, when the want of a part that is necessary
for the maintenance of its neighbours is supplied
by the remaining parts; and the abortions or malformations
in growth, in which certain parts, on
account of casual defects or hindrances, form themselves
in a new way to maintain what exists, and so
produce an anomalous creature, I shall only mention
in passing, though they are among the most wonderful
properties of organised creatures.</p>
<h5 id="s65">§ 65. <i>Things regarded as natural purposes are
organised beings</i></h5>
<p>According to the character alleged in the preceding
section, a thing, which, though a natural product,
is to be cognised as only possible as a natural
purpose, must bear itself alternately as cause and as
effect. This, however, is a somewhat inexact and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
indeterminate expression which needs derivation
from a determinate concept.</p>
<p>Causal combination as thought merely by the
Understanding is a connexion constituting an ever-progressive
series (of causes and effects); and things
which as effects presuppose others as causes cannot be
reciprocally at the same time causes of these. This
sort of causal combination we call that of effective
causes (<i>nexus effectivus</i>). But on the other hand, a
causal combination according to a concept of Reason
(of purposes) can also be thought, which regarded
as a series would lead either forwards or backwards;
in this the thing that has been called the effect
may with equal propriety be termed the cause of
that of which it is the effect. In the practical
department of human art we easily find connexions
such as this; <i>e.g.</i> a house, no doubt, is the cause of
the money received for rent, but also conversely
the representation of this possible income was the
cause of building the house. Such a causal connexion
we call that of final causes (<i>nexus finalis</i>). We
may perhaps suitably name the first the connexion
of real causes, the second of those which are ideal;
because from this nomenclature it is at once comprehended
that there can be no more than these two
kinds of causality.</p>
<p>For a thing to be a natural purpose in the <i>first</i>
place it is requisite that its parts (as regards their
being and their form) are only possible through
their reference to the whole. For the thing itself is
a purpose and so is comprehended under a concept
or an Idea which must determine <i>a priori</i> all that
is to be contained in it. But so far as a thing is
only thought as possible in this way, it is a mere
work of art; <i>i.e.</i> a product of one rational cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
distinct from the matter (of the parts), whose
causality (in the collection and combination of the
parts) is determined through its Idea of a whole
possible by their means (and consequently not
through external nature).</p>
<p>But if a thing as a natural product is to involve
in itself and in its internal possibility a reference to
purposes,—<i>i.e.</i> to be possible only as a natural purpose,
and without the causality of the concepts of
rational beings external to itself,—then it is requisite
<i>secondly</i> that its parts should so combine in the unity
of a whole that they are reciprocally cause and effect
of each other’s form. Only in this way can the Idea
of the whole conversely (reciprocally) determine the
form and combination of all the parts; not indeed as
cause—for then it would be an artificial product—but
as the ground of cognition, for him who is
judging it, of the systematic unity and combination
of all the manifold contained in the given material.</p>
<p>For a body then which is to be judged in itself
and its internal possibility as a natural purpose, it
is requisite that its parts mutually depend upon each
other both as to their form and their combination,
and so produce a whole by their own causality;
while conversely the concept of the whole may be
regarded as its cause according to a principle (in a
being possessing a causality according to concepts
adequate to such a product). In this case then the
connexion of <i>effective causes</i> may be judged as an
<i>effect through final causes</i>.</p>
<p>In such a product of nature every part not only
exists <i>by means of</i> the other parts, but is thought as
existing <i>for the sake of</i> the others and the whole,
that is as an (organic) instrument. Thus, however,
it might be an artificial instrument, and so might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
represented only as a purpose that is possible in
general; but also its parts are all organs reciprocally
<i>producing</i> each other. This can never be the case
with artificial instruments, but only with nature which
supplies all the material for instruments (even for
those of art). Only a product of such a kind can
be called a <i>natural purpose</i>, and this because it is
an <i>organised</i> and <i>self-organising being</i>.</p>
<p>In a watch one part is the instrument for moving
the other parts, but the wheel is not the effective
cause of the production of the others; no doubt one
part is for the sake of the others, but it does not
exist by their means. In this case the producing
cause of the parts and of their form is not contained
in the nature (of the material), but is external to it in
a being which can produce effects according to Ideas
of a whole possible by means of its causality. Hence
a watch wheel does not produce other wheels, still
less does one watch produce other watches, utilising
(organising) foreign material for that purpose; hence
it does not replace of itself parts of which it has been
deprived, nor does it make good what is lacking in
a first formation by the addition of the missing parts,
nor if it has gone out of order does it repair itself—all
of which, on the contrary, we may expect from
organised nature.—An organised being is then not
a mere machine, for that has merely <i>moving</i> power,
but it possesses in itself <i>formative</i> power of a self-propagating
kind which it communicates to its
materials though they have it not of themselves;
it organises them, in fact, and this cannot be explained
by the mere mechanical faculty of motion.</p>
<p>We say of nature and its faculty in organised
products far too little if we describe it as an <i>analogon
of art</i>; for this suggests an artificer (a rational being)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
external to it. Much rather does it organise itself
and its organised products in every species, no doubt
after one general pattern but yet with suitable deviations,
which self-preservation demands according to
circumstances. We perhaps approach nearer to this
inscrutable property, if we describe it as an <i>analogon
of life</i>; but then we must either endow matter, as
mere matter, with a property which contradicts
its very being (hylozoism), or associate therewith an
alien principle <i>standing in communion</i> with it (a
soul). But in the latter case we must, if such a
product is to be a natural product, either presuppose
organised matter as the instrument of that soul,
which does not make the soul a whit more comprehensible;
or regard the soul as artificer of this
structure and so remove the product from (corporeal)
nature. To speak strictly, then, the organisation of
nature has in it nothing analogous to any causality
we know.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_108" id="FNanchor_108">108</a> Beauty in nature can be rightly described
as an analogon of art, because it is ascribed to objects
only in reference to reflection upon their <i>external</i>
aspect, and consequently only on account of the
form of their external surface. But <i>internal natural
perfection</i>, as it belongs to those things which are
only possible as <i>natural purposes</i>, and are therefore
called organised beings, is not analogous to any
physical, <i>i.e.</i> natural, faculty known to us; nay even,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
regarding ourselves as, in the widest sense, belonging
to nature, it is not even thinkable or explicable by
means of any exactly fitting analogy to human art.</p>
<p>The concept of a thing as in itself a natural
purpose is therefore no constitutive concept of
Understanding or of Reason, but it can serve as a
regulative concept for the reflective Judgement, to
guide our investigation about objects of this kind
by a distant analogy with our own causality according
to purposes generally, and in our meditations
upon their ultimate ground. This latter use, however,
is not in reference to the knowledge of nature or of
its original ground, but rather to our own practical
faculty of Reason, in analogy with which we considered
the cause of that purposiveness.</p>
<p>Organised beings are then the only beings in
nature which, considered in themselves and apart
from any relation to other things, can be thought as
possible only as purposes of nature. Hence they
first afford objective reality to the concept of a
<i>purpose of nature</i>, as distinguished from a practical
purpose; and so they give to the science of nature the
basis for a teleology, <i>i.e.</i> a mode of judgement about
natural Objects according to a special principle
which otherwise we should in no way be justified
in introducing (because we cannot see <i>a priori</i> the
possibility of this kind of causality).</p>
<h5 id="s66">§ 66. <i>Of the principle of judging of internal
purposiveness in organised beings</i></h5>
<p>This principle, which is at the same time a
definition, is as follows: <i>An organised product of
nature is one in which every part is reciprocally
purpose, [end] and means.</i> In it nothing is vain, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
purpose, or to be ascribed to a blind mechanism
of nature.</p>
<p>This principle, as regards its occasion, is doubtless
derived from experience, viz. from that methodised
experience called observation; but on account of
the universality and necessity which it ascribes to
such purposiveness it cannot rest solely on empirical
grounds, but must have at its basis an <i>a priori</i>
principle, although it be merely regulative and
these purposes lie only in the idea of the judging
[subject] and not in an effective cause. We may
therefore describe the aforesaid principle as a <i>maxim</i>
for judging of the internal purposiveness of organised
beings.</p>
<p>It is an acknowledged fact that the dissectors
of plants and animals, in order to investigate their
structure and to find out the reasons, why and for
what end such parts, such a disposition and combination
of parts, and just such an internal form
have been given them, assume as indisputably necessary
the maxim that nothing in such a creature is
<i>vain</i>; just as they lay down as the fundamental
proposition of the universal science of nature, that
<i>nothing</i> happens <i>by chance</i>. In fact, they can as little
free themselves from this teleological proposition
as from the universal physical proposition; for as
without the latter we should have no experience
at all, so without the former we should have no
guiding thread for the observation of a species
of natural things which we have thought teleologically
under the concept of natural purposes.</p>
<p>Now this concept brings the Reason into a
quite different order of things from that of a mere
mechanism of nature, which is no longer satisfying
here. An Idea is to be the ground of the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of the natural product. But because this is an
absolute unity of representation, instead of the
material being a plurality of things that can supply
by itself no definite unity of composition,—if that unity
of the Idea is to serve at all as the <i>a priori</i> ground
of determination of a natural law of the causality of
such a form of composition,—the purpose of nature
must be extended to <i>everything</i> included in its
product. For if we once refer action of this sort
<i>on the whole</i> to any supersensible ground of determination
beyond the blind mechanism of nature,
we must judge of it altogether according to this
principle; and we have then no reason to regard
the form of such a thing as partly dependent on
mechanism—for by such mixing up of disparate
principles no certain rule of judging would be left.</p>
<p>For example, it may be that in an animal body
many parts can be conceived as concretions according
to mere mechanical laws (as the hide, the bones,
the hair). And yet the cause which brings together
the required matter, modifies it, forms it, and puts
it in its appropriate place, must always be judged
of teleologically; so that here everything must be
considered as organised, and everything again in
a certain relation to the thing itself is an organ.</p>
<h5 id="s67">§ 67. <i>Of the principle of the teleological judging
of nature in general as a system of purposes</i></h5>
<p>We have already said above that the <i>external</i>
purposiveness of natural things affords no sufficient
warrant for using them as purposes of nature in
order to explain their presence, and for regarding
their contingently purposive effects as the grounds
of their presence according to the principle of final<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
causes. Thus we cannot take for natural purposes,
<i>rivers</i> because they promote intercourse among
inland peoples, <i>mountains</i> because they contain the
sources of the rivers and for their maintenance in
rainless seasons have a store of snow, or the <i>slope</i>
of the land which carries away the water and leaves
the country dry; because although this shape of the
earth’s surface be very necessary for the origin and
maintenance of the vegetable and animal kingdoms,
it has nothing in itself for the possibility of which
we are forced to assume a causality according to
purposes. The same is true of plants which man
uses for his needs or his pleasures; of beasts, the
camel, the ox, the horse, dog, etc., which are indispensable
to him as well for food as because they
are used in his service in many different ways. In
the case of things which we have no reason for
regarding in themselves as purposes, such external
relation can only be hypothetically judged as purposive.</p>
<p>To judge of a thing as a natural purpose on
account of its internal form is something very
different from taking the existence of that thing to
be a purpose of nature. For the latter assertion
we require not merely the concept of a possible
purpose, but the knowledge of the final purpose
(<i>scopus</i>) of nature. But this requires a reference
of such knowledge to something supersensible far
transcending all our teleological knowledge of nature,
for the purpose of [the existence of]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109" id="FNanchor_109">109</a> nature must
itself be sought beyond nature. The internal form
of a mere blade of grass is sufficient to show that
for our human faculty of judgement its origin is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
possible only according to the rule of purposes.
But if we change our point of view and look to the
use which other natural beings make of it, abandon
the consideration of its internal organisation and
only look to its externally purposive references, we
shall arrive at no categorical purpose; all this purposive
reference rests on an ever more distant condition,
which, as unconditioned (the presence of a
thing as final purpose), lies quite outside the physico-teleological
view of the world. For example, grass
is needful for the ox, which again is needful for man
as a means of existence, but then we do not see why
it is necessary that men should exist (a question
this, which we shall not find so easy to answer if we
sometimes cast our thoughts on the New Hollanders
or the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego). So conceived,
the thing is not even a natural purpose, for
neither it (nor its whole genus) is to be regarded as
a natural product.</p>
<p>Hence it is only so far as matter is organised
that it necessarily carries with it the concept of a
natural purpose, because this its specific form is at
the same time a product of nature. But this concept
leads necessarily to the Idea of collective
nature as a system in accordance with the rule of
purposes, to which Idea all the mechanism of nature
must be subordinated according to principles of
Reason (at least in order to investigate natural
phenomena therein). The principle of Reason belongs
to it only as a subjective principle or a maxim:
viz. everything in the World is some way good for
something; nothing is vain in it. By the example
that nature gives us in its organic products we are
justified, nay called upon, to expect of it and of its
laws nothing that is not purposive on the whole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
It is plain that this is not a principle for the
determinant but only for the reflective Judgement;
that it is regulative and not constitutive; and that
we derive from it a clue by which we consider
natural things in reference to an already given ground
of determination according to a new law-abiding
order; and extend our natural science according to
a different principle, viz. that of final causes, but yet
without prejudice to the principle of mechanical
causality. Furthermore, it is in no wise thus
decided, whether anything of which we judge by this
principle, is a <i>designed</i> purpose of nature; whether
the grass is for the ox or the sheep, or whether
these and the other things of nature are here for
men. It is well also from this side to consider the
things which are unpleasant to us and are contrary
to purpose in particular references. Thus, for
example, we can say: The vermin that torment men
in their clothes, their hair, or their beds, may be,
according to a wise appointment of nature, a motive
to cleanliness which is in itself an important means
for the preservation of health. Or again the mosquitoes
and other stinging insects that make the
wildernesses of America so oppressive to the savages,
may be so many goads to activity for these primitive
men, [inducing them] to drain the marshes and
bring light into the forests which intercept every
breath of air, and in this way, as well as by cultivating
the soil, to make their habitations more healthy.
The same thing, which appears to men contradictory
to nature in its inner organisation, if viewed in this
light gives an entertaining, sometimes an instructive,
outlook into a teleological order of things, to which,
without such a principle, mere physical observation
would not lead us by itself. Thus some persons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
regard the tapeworm as given to the men or
animals in whom it resides, as a kind of set-off for
some defect in their vital organs; now I would ask
if dreams (without which we never sleep, though we
seldom remember them) may not be a purposive
ordinance of nature? For during the relaxation of
all the moving powers of the body, they serve
to excite internally the vital organs by the medium
of the Imagination and its great activity (which in
this state generally rises to the height of affection).
During sleep the Imagination commonly is more
actively at play when the stomach is overloaded, in
which case this excitement is the more necessary.
Consequently, then, without this internal power of
motion and this fatiguing unrest, on account of which
we complain about our dreams (though in fact they
are rather remedial), sleep even in a sound state of
health would be a complete extinction of life.</p>
<p>Also the beauty of nature, <i>i.e.</i> its connexion
with the free play of our cognitive faculties in
apprehending and judging of its appearance, can be
regarded as a kind of objective purposiveness of
nature in its whole [content] as a system of which
man is a member; if once the teleological judging
of the same by means of the natural purposes which
organised beings suggest to us, has justified for
us the Idea of a great system of purposes of nature.
We can regard it as a favour<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_110" id="FNanchor_110">110</a> which nature has felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
for us, that in addition to what is useful it has so
profusely dispensed beauty and charm; and we can
therefore love it, as well as regard it with respect on
account of its immensity, and feel ourselves ennobled
by such regard; just as if nature had established
and adorned its splendid theatre precisely with this
view.</p>
<p>We shall say only one thing more in this paragraph.
If we have once discovered in nature a
faculty of bringing forth products that can only be
thought by us in accordance with the concept of
final causes, we go further still. We venture to
judge that things belong to a system of purposes,
which yet do not (either in themselves or in their
purposive relations) necessitate our seeking for any
principle of their possibility beyond the mechanism
of causes working blindly. For the first Idea, as
concerns its ground, already brings us beyond the
world of sense; since the unity of the supersensible
principle must be regarded as valid in this way not
merely for certain species of natural beings, but for
the whole of nature as a system.</p>
<h5 id="s68">§ 68. <i>Of the principle of Teleology as internal
principle of natural science</i></h5>
<p>The principles of a science are either internal to
it and are then called domestic (<i>principia domestica</i>),
or are based on concepts that can only find their
place outside it and so are <i>foreign</i> principles (<i>peregrina</i>).
Sciences that contain the latter, place at
the basis of their doctrines auxiliary propositions
(<i>lemmata</i>), <i>i.e.</i> they borrow some concept, and with
it a ground of arrangement, from another science.</p>
<p>Every science is in itself a system, and it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
enough in it to build in accordance with principles
and thus to employ a technical procedure, but we
must go to work with it architectonically, as a
building subsisting for itself; we must not treat it as
an additional wing or part of another building, but
as a whole in itself, although we may subsequently
make a passage from it into that other or conversely.</p>
<p>If then we introduce into the context of natural
science the concept of God in order to explain the
purposiveness in nature, and subsequently use this
purposiveness to prove that there is a God, there is
no internal consistency in either science [<i>i.e.</i> either
in natural science or theology]; and a delusive
circle brings them both into uncertainty, because
they have allowed their boundaries to overlap.</p>
<p>The expression, a purpose of nature, already
sufficiently prevents the confusion of mixing up
natural science and the occasion that it gives for
judging <i>teleologically</i> of its objects, with the consideration
of God, and so of a <i>theological</i> derivation
of them. We must not regard it as insignificant,
if one interchanges this expression with that of a
divine purpose in the ordering of nature, or gives
out the latter as more suitable and proper for a
pious soul, because it must come in the end to
deriving these purposive forms in nature from a
wise author of the world. On the contrary, we
must carefully and modestly limit ourselves to the
expression, a purpose of nature, which asserts exactly
as much as we know. Before we ask after the cause
of nature itself, we find in nature, and in the course
of its development, products of the same kind which
are developed in it according to known empirical
laws, in accordance with which natural science must
judge of its objects, and, consequently, must seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
in nature their causality according to the rule of
purposes. So then it must not transgress its bounds
in order to introduce into itself as a domestic principle
that, to whose concept no experience can be commensurate,
upon which we are only entitled to
venture after the completion of natural science.</p>
<p>Natural characteristics which demonstrate themselves
<i>a priori</i>, and consequently admit of insight
into their possibility from universal principles without
any admixture of experience, although they
carry with them a technical purposiveness, yet cannot,
because they are absolutely necessary, be referred
to the Teleology of nature, as to a method belonging
to Physic for solving its problems. Arithmetical
or geometrical analogies, as well as universal
mechanical laws,—however strange and admirable
may seem to us the union of different rules, quite
independent of one another according to all appearance,
in a single principle,—possess on that account
no claim to be teleological grounds of explanation
in Physic. Even if they deserve to be brought into
consideration in the universal theory of the purposiveness
of things of nature, yet they belong to another
[science], <i>i.e.</i> Metaphysic, and constitute no internal
principle of natural science; as with the empirical
laws of natural purposes in organised beings, it is not
only permissible but unavoidable to use the teleological
<i>mode of judging</i> as a principle of the doctrine
of nature in regard to a particular class of its objects.</p>
<p>So to the end that Physic may keep within its
own bounds, it abstracts itself entirely from the
question, whether natural purposes are <i>designed</i> or
<i>undesigned</i>; for that would be to meddle in an
extraneous business, in Metaphysic. It is enough
that there are objects, alone <i>explicable</i> according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
to natural laws which we can only think by means
of the Idea of purposes as principle, and also alone
internally <i>cognisable</i> as concerns their internal form,
in this way. In order, therefore, to remove the
suspicion of the slightest assumption,—as if we
wished to mix with our grounds of cognition
something not belonging to Physic at all, viz. a
supernatural cause,—we speak in Teleology, indeed,
of nature as if the purposiveness therein were designed,
but in such a way that this design is ascribed
to nature, <i>i.e.</i> to matter. Now in this way there can
be no misunderstanding, because no design in the
proper meaning of the word can possibly be ascribed
to inanimate matter; we thus give notice that this
word here only expresses a principle of the reflective
not of the determinant Judgement, and so is to
introduce no particular ground of causality; but
only adds for the use of the Reason a different
kind of investigation from that according to
mechanical laws, in order to supplement the inadequacy
of the latter even for empirical research
into all particular laws of nature. Hence we speak
quite correctly in Teleology, so far as it is referred
to Physic, of the wisdom, the economy, the forethought,
the beneficence of Nature, without either
making an intelligent being of it, for that would be
preposterous; or even without presuming to place
another intelligent Being above it as its Architect,
for that would be presumptuous.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_111" id="FNanchor_111">111</a> But there should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
be only signified thereby a kind of causality of
nature after the analogy of our own in the technical
use of Reason, in order to have before us the rule
according to which certain products of nature must
be investigated.</p>
<p>But now why is it that Teleology usually forms
no proper part of theoretical natural science, but
is regarded as a propaedeutic or transition to
Theology? This is done in order to restrict the
study of nature, mechanically considered, to that
which we can so subject to observation or experiment
that we are able to produce it ourselves as
nature does, or at least by similar laws. For we
see into a thing completely only so far as we can
make it in accordance with our concepts and bring
it to completion. But organisation, as an inner
purpose of nature, infinitely surpasses all our faculty
of presenting the like by means of art. And as
concerns the external contrivances of nature regarded
as purposive (wind, rain, etc.), Physic, indeed, considers
their mechanism, but it cannot at all present
their reference to purposes, so far as this is a condition
necessarily belonging to cause; for this necessity
of connexion has to do altogether with the combination
of our concepts and not with the constitution
of things.</p>

<h3 id="division_2_2">SECOND DIVISION<br>
<span class="subhead">DIALECTIC OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT</span></h3>
<h5 id="s69">§ 69. <i>What is an antinomy of the Judgement?</i></h5>
<p>The <i>determinant</i> Judgement has for itself no
principles which are the foundation of <i>concepts of
Objects</i>. It has no autonomy, for it <i>subsumes</i> only
under given laws or concepts as principles. Hence
it is exposed to no danger of an antinomy of its own
or to a conflict of its principles. So [we saw that]
the transcendental Judgement which contains the
conditions of subsuming under categories was for
itself not <i>nomothetic</i>, but that it only indicated the
conditions of sensuous intuition, under which reality
(application) can be supplied to a given concept, as
law of the Understanding, whereby the Judgement
could never fall into discord with itself (at least as
far as its principles are concerned).</p>
<p>But the <i>reflective</i> Judgement must subsume under
a law, which is not yet given, and is therefore in fact
only a principle of reflection upon objects, for which
we are objectively quite in want of a law or of a
concept of an Object that would be adequate as a
principle for the cases that occur. Since now no use
of the cognitive faculties can be permitted without
principles, the reflective Judgement must in such
cases serve as a principle for itself. This, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
it is not objective and can supply no ground of
cognition of the Object adequate for design, must
serve as a mere subjective principle, for the purposive
employment of our cognitive faculties, <i>i.e.</i>
for reflecting upon a class of objects. Therefore in
reference to such cases the reflective Judgement has
its maxims—necessary maxims—on behalf of the
cognition of natural laws in experience, in order to
attain by their means to concepts, even concepts
of Reason; since it has absolute need of such in
order to learn merely to cognise nature according to
its empirical laws.—Between these necessary
maxims of the reflective Judgement there may be a
conflict and consequently an antinomy, upon which
a Dialectic bases itself. If each of two conflicting
maxims has its ground in the nature of the cognitive
faculties, this may be called a natural Dialectic, and
an unavoidable illusion which we must expose and
resolve in our Critique, to the end that it may not
deceive us.</p>
<h5 id="s70">§ 70. <i>Representation of this antinomy</i></h5>
<p>So far as Reason has to do with nature, as the
complex of objects of external sense, it can base itself
partly upon laws which the Understanding itself
prescribes <i>a priori</i> to nature, partly upon laws which
it can extend indefinitely by means of the empirical
determinations occurring in experience. To apply
the former kind of laws, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>universal</i> laws of
material nature in general, the Judgement needs no
special principle of reflection, since it is there
determinant because an objective principle is given
to it through Understanding. But as regards the
particular laws that can only be made known to us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
through experience, there can be under them such
great manifoldness and diversity, that the Judgement
must serve as its own principle in order to investigate
and search into the phenomena of nature
in accordance with a law. Such a guiding thread is
needed, if we are only to hope for a connected
empirical cognition according to a thoroughgoing
conformity of nature to law, even its unity according
to empirical laws. In this contingent unity of
particular laws it may very well happen that the
Judgement in its reflection proceeds from two maxims.
One of these is suggested to it <i>a priori</i> by the mere
Understanding; but the other is prompted by particular
experiences, which bring the Reason into
play in order to form a judgement upon corporeal
nature and its laws in accordance with a particular
principle. Hence it comes about that these two
kinds of maxims seem to be incapable of existing
together, and consequently a Dialectic arises which
leads the Judgement into error in the principle of its
reflection.</p>
<p>The <i>first maxim</i> of Judgement is the <i>proposition</i>:
all production of material things and their forms
must be judged to be possible according to merely
mechanical laws.</p>
<p>The <i>second maxim</i> is the <i>counter-proposition</i>:
some products of material nature cannot be judged
to be possible according to merely mechanical laws.
(To judge them requires quite a different law of
causality, namely, that of final causes.)</p>
<p>If these regulative principles of investigation be
converted into constitutive principles of the possibility
of Objects, they will run thus:</p>
<p><i>Proposition</i>: All production of material things is
possible according to merely mechanical laws.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
<i>Counter-proposition</i>: Some production of material
things is not possible according to merely mechanical
laws.</p>
<p>In this latter aspect, as objective principles for
the determinant Judgement, they would contradict
each other; and consequently one of the two propositions
must necessarily be false. We shall then,
it is true, have an antinomy, but not of Judgement;
there will be a conflict in the legislation of Reason.
Reason, however, can prove neither the one nor the
other of these fundamental propositions, because we
can have <i>a priori</i> no determinant principle of the
possibility of things according to mere empirical
laws of nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as regards the first-mentioned
maxims of a reflective Judgement, they involve no
contradiction in fact. For if I say, I must <i>judge</i>,
according to merely mechanical laws, of the possibility
of all events in material nature, and consequently
of all forms regarded as its products, I do
not therefore say: <i>They are possible in this way alone</i>
(apart from any other kind of causality). All that is
implied is: I <i>must</i> always <i>reflect</i> upon them <i>according
to the principle</i> of the mere mechanism of nature, and
consequently investigate this as far as I can; because
unless this lies at the basis of investigation, there can
be no proper knowledge of nature at all. But this
does not prevent us, if occasion offers, from following
out the second maxim in the case of certain natural
forms (and even by occasion of these in the whole
of nature), in order to reflect upon them according
to the principle of final causes, which is quite a
different thing from explaining them according to
the mechanism of nature. Reflection in accordance
with the first maxim is thus not abrogated; on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
contrary, we are told to follow it as far as we can.
Nor is it said that these forms would not be possible
in accordance with the mechanism of nature. It is
only asserted that <i>human Reason</i> in following up this
maxim and in this way could never find the least
ground for that which constitutes the specific
[character] of a natural purpose, although it would
increase its knowledge of natural laws. Thus it is
left undecided whether or not in the unknown inner
ground of nature, physico-mechanical and purposive
combination may be united in the same things in one
principle. We only say that our Reason is not in a
position so to unite them; and that therefore the
Judgement (as <i>reflective</i>—from subjective grounds,
not as determinant, in consequence of an objective
principle of the possibility of things in themselves)
is compelled to think a different principle from that
of natural mechanism as the ground of the possibility
of certain forms in nature.</p>
<h5 id="s71">§ 71. <i>Preliminary to the solution of the above
antinomy</i></h5>
<p>We can in no way prove the impossibility of the
production of organised natural products by the mere
mechanism of nature, because we cannot see into
the first inner ground of the infinite multiplicity of
the particular laws of nature, which are contingent
for us since they are only empirically known; and so
we cannot arrive at the inner all-sufficient principle
of the possibility of a nature (a principle which lies
in the supersensible). Whether therefore the productive
faculty of nature is sufficient for that which
we judge to be formed or combined in accordance
with the Idea of purposes, as well as for that which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
we believe to require merely a mechanical system
[Maschinenwesen] of nature; or whether there lies
at the basis of things which we must necessarily
judge as properly natural purposes, a quite different
kind of original causality, which cannot be contained
in material nature or in its intelligible substrate, viz.
an architectonic Understanding—this is a question
to which our Reason, very narrowly limited in respect
of the concept of causality if it is to be specified <i>a
priori</i>, can give no answer whatever.—But it is just
as certain and beyond doubt that, in regard to our
cognitive faculties, the mere mechanism of nature
can furnish no ground of explanation of the production
of organised beings. <i>For the reflective Judgement</i>
it is therefore a quite correct fundamental
proposition, that for that connexion of things according
to final causes which is so plain, there must be
thought a causality distinct from that of mechanism,
viz. that of an (intelligent) cause of the world acting
in accordance with purposes; but <i>for the determinant
Judgement</i> this would be a hasty and unprovable
proposition. In the first case it is a mere maxim of
the Judgement, wherein the concept of that causality
is a mere Idea, to which we by no means undertake
to concede reality, but which we use as a guide to
reflection, which remains thereby always open to all
mechanical grounds of explanation and does not
withdraw out of the world of Sense. In the second
case the proposition would be an objective principle
prescribed by Reason, to which the determinant
Judgement must subject itself, whereby however it
withdraws beyond the world of Sense into the transcendent
and perhaps is led into error.</p>
<p>All appearance of an antinomy between the
maxims of the proper physical (mechanical) and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
teleological (technical) methods of explanation rests
therefore on this; that we confuse a fundamental
proposition of the reflective with one of the determinant
Judgement, and the <i>autonomy</i> of the first
(which has mere subjective validity for our use of
Reason in respect of particular empirical laws) with
the <i>heteronomy</i> of the second, which must regulate
itself according to laws (universal or particular)
given to it by the Understanding.</p>
<h5 id="s72">§ 72. <i>Of the different systems which deal with the
purposiveness of nature</i></h5>
<p>No one has ever doubted the correctness of the
proposition that judgement must be passed upon
certain things of nature (organised beings) and their
possibility in accordance with the concept of final
causes, even if we only desire a <i>guiding thread</i> to
learn how to cognise their constitution through
observation, without aspiring to an investigation into
their first origin. The question therefore can only
be: whether this fundamental proposition is merely
subjectively valid, <i>i.e.</i> is a mere maxim of our
Judgement; or whether it is an objective principle
of nature, in accordance with which, apart from its
mechanism (according to the mere laws of motion),
quite a different kind of causality attaches to it, viz.
that of final causes, under which these laws (of
moving forces) stand only as intermediate causes.</p>
<p>We could leave this question or problem quite
undecided and unsolved speculatively; because if we
content ourselves with speculation within the bounds
of mere natural knowledge, we have enough in these
maxims for the study of nature and for the tracking
out of its hidden secrets, as far as human powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
reach. There is then indeed a certain presentiment
of our Reason or a hint as it were given us by
nature, that, by means of this concept of final causes,
we go beyond nature, and could unite it to the
highest point in the series of causes, if we were to
abandon or at least to lay aside for a time the
investigation of nature (although we may not have
advanced far in it), and seek thenceforth to find out
whither this stranger in natural science, viz. the
concept of natural purposes, would lead us.</p>
<p>But here these undisputed maxims pass over
into problems opening out a wide field for difficulties.
Does purposive connexion in nature <i>prove</i> a particular
kind of causality? Or is it not rather,
considered in itself and in accordance with objective
principles, similar to the mechanism of nature, resting
on one and the same ground? Only, as this
ground in many natural products is often hidden
too deep for our investigation, we make trial of
a subjective principle, that of art, <i>i.e.</i> of causality
according to Ideas, and we ascribe it to nature by
analogy. This expedient succeeds in many cases,
but seems in some to mislead, and in no case does
it justify us in introducing into natural science a
particular kind of operation quite distinct from the
causality according to the mere mechanical laws of
nature. We give the name of <i>Technic</i> to the procedure
(the causality) of nature, on account of the
appearance of purpose that we find in its products;
and we shall divide this into <i>designed</i> (<i>technica
intentionalis</i>) and <i>undesigned</i> (<i>technica naturalis</i>).
The first is meant to signify that the productive
faculty of nature according to final causes must be
taken for a particular kind of causality; the second
that it is at bottom quite similar to the mechanism of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
nature, and that its contingent agreement with our
artistic concepts and their rules should be explained
as a mere subjective condition of judging it, and not,
falsely, as a particular kind of natural production.</p>
<p>If we now speak of systems explanatory of
nature in regard of final causes, it must be remarked
that they all controvert each other dogmatically,
<i>i.e.</i> as to objective principles of the possibility of
things, whether there are causes which act designedly
or whether they are quite without design. They
do not dispute as to the subjective maxims, by
which we merely judge of the causes of such
purposive products. In this latter case <i>disparate</i>
principles could very well be unified; but in the
former, contradictorily opposed laws annul each other
and cannot subsist together.</p>
<p>There are two sorts of systems as to the Technic
of nature, <i>i.e.</i> its productive power in accordance
with the rule of purposes; viz. <i>Idealism</i> or <i>Realism</i>
of natural purposes. The first maintains that all
purposiveness of nature is <i>undesigned</i>; the second
that some (in organised beings) is <i>designed</i>. From
this latter the hypothetical consequence can be
deduced that the Technic of Nature, as concerns
all its other products in reference to the whole of
nature, is also designed, <i>i.e.</i> is a purpose.</p>
<p>(1) The <i>Idealism</i> of purposiveness (I always understand
here by this, objective purposiveness) is either
that of the <i>casuality</i> or the <i>fatality</i> of the determination
of nature in the purposive form of its products.
The former principle treats of the reference of matter
to the physical basis of its form, viz. the laws of
motion; the second, its reference to the <i>hyperphysical</i>
basis of itself and of the whole of nature. The
system of <i>casuality</i> that is ascribed to <i>Epicurus</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
<i>Democritus</i> is, taken literally, so plainly absurd that
it need not detain us. Opposed to this is the
system of fatality, of which <i>Spinoza</i> is taken as the
author, although it is much older according to
all appearance. This, as it appeals to something
supersensible to which our insight does not extend,
is not so easy to controvert; but that is because its
concept of the original Being is not possible to
understand. But so much is clear, that on this
theory the purposive combination in the world must
be taken as undesigned; for although derived from
an original Being, it is not derived from its Understanding
or from any design on its part, but rather
from the necessity of its nature and of the world-unity
which emanates therefrom. Consequently the
Fatalism of purposiveness is at the same time an
Idealism.</p>
<p>(2) The <i>Realism</i> of the purposiveness of
nature is also either physical or hyperphysical.
The <i>former</i> bases the purposes in nature, by the
analogy of a faculty acting with design, on the <i>life
of matter</i> (either its own or the life of an inner
principle in it, a world-soul) and is called <i>Hylozoism</i>.
The <i>latter</i> derives them from the original ground
of the universe, as from an intelligent Being
(originally living), who produces them with design,
and is <i>Theism</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_112" id="FNanchor_112">112</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s73">§ 73. <i>None of the above systems give what they
pretend</i></h5>
<p>What do all these systems desire? They desire
to explain our teleological judgements about nature,
and they go so to work therewith that some deny
their truth and, consequently, explain them as an
Idealism of Nature (represented as Art); others
recognise them as true, and promise to establish
the possibility of a nature in accordance with the
Idea of final causes.</p>
<p>(1) The systems which defend the Idealism of
final causes in nature grant, it is true, on the one
hand to their principle a causality in accordance with
the laws of motion (through which [causality] natural
things exist purposively); but they deny to it <i>intentionality</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> that it designedly determines itself to
this its purposive production; in other words, they
deny that the cause is a purpose. This is <i>Epicurus’s</i>
method of explanation, according to which the distinction
between a Technic of nature and mere
mechanism is altogether denied. Blind chance is
taken as the explanatory ground not only of the
agreement of the developed products with our concepts
of the purpose, and consequently of [nature’s]
Technic; but also of the determination of the causes
of this production in accordance with the laws of
motion, and consequently of their mechanism.
Thus nothing is explained, not even the illusion in
our teleological judgements, and consequently, the
would-be Idealism of these in no way established.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <i>Spinoza</i> wishes to dispense
with all inquiries into the ground of the possibility
of purposes of nature, and to take away all reality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
from this Idea. He allows their validity in general
not as products but as accidents inhering in an
original Being; and to this Being, as substrate of
those natural things, he ascribes not causality in
regard to them but mere subsistence. On account
of its unconditioned necessity, and also that of all
natural things as accidents inhering in it, he secures,
it is true, to the forms of nature that unity of ground
which is requisite for all purposiveness; but at the
same time he tears away their contingence, without
which no <i>unity of purpose</i> can be thought, and
with it all <i>design</i>, inasmuch as he takes away all
intelligence from the original ground of natural
things.</p>
<p>But Spinozism does not furnish what it desires.
It desires to afford an explanatory ground of the
purposive connexion (which it does not deny) of
the things of nature, and it merely speaks of the
unity of the subject in which they all inhere. But
even if we concede to it that the beings of the
world exist in this way, such ontological unity is not
therefore a <i>unity of purpose</i>, and does not make this
in any way comprehensible. For this latter is a
quite particular kind of unity which does not follow
from the connexion of things (the beings of the
world) in a subject (the original Being), but implies in
itself reference to a <i>cause</i> which has Understanding;
and even if we unite all these things in a simple
subject, this never exhibits a purposive reference.
For we do not think of them, first, as the inner
<i>effects</i> of the substance, as if it were a <i>cause</i>; nor,
secondly, of this cause as a cause producing effects
<i>by means of its Understanding</i>. Without these
formal conditions all unity is mere natural necessity;
and, if it is ascribed as well to things which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
represent as external to one another, blind necessity.
But if we wish to give the name of purposiveness of
nature to that which the schoolmen call the transcendental
perfection of things (in reference to their
proper being), according to which everything has in
itself that which is requisite to make it one thing
and not another, then we are only like children
playing with words instead of concepts. For if all
things must be thought as purposes, then to be a
thing is the same as to be a purpose, and there is
at bottom nothing which specially deserves to be
represented as a purpose.</p>
<p>We hence see at once that Spinoza by his reducing
our concepts of the purposive in nature to our
own consciousness of existing in an all-embracing
(though simple) Being, and by his seeking that form
merely in the unity of this Being, must have intended
to maintain not the realism, but the idealism of its
purposiveness. Even this he was not able to accomplish,
because the mere representation of the unity
of the substrate cannot bring about the Idea of a
purposiveness, even that which is only undesigned.</p>
<p>(2) Those who not only maintain the <i>Realism</i>
of natural purposes, but also set about explaining
it, believe that they can comprehend, at least as
regards its possibility, a practical kind of causality,
viz. that of causes working designedly; otherwise
they could not undertake to supply this explanation.
For to authorise even the most daring of hypotheses,
at least the <i>possibility</i> of what we assume as basis
must be <i>certain</i>, and we must be able to assure
objective reality to its concept.</p>
<p>But the possibility of living matter cannot even
be thought; its concept involves a contradiction
because lifelessness, <i>inertia</i>, constitutes the essential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
character of matter. The possibility of matter
endowed with life, and of collective nature regarded
as an animal, can only be used in an inadequate
way (in the interests of the hypothesis of purposiveness
in the whole of nature), so far as it is manifested
by experience in the organisation of nature
on a small scale; but in no way can we have insight
into its possibility <i>a priori</i>. There must then be a
circle in the explanation, if we wish to derive the
purposiveness of nature in organised beings from
the life of matter, and yet only know this life in
organised beings, and can form no concept of
its possibility without experience of this kind.
Hylozoism, therefore, does not furnish what it
promises.</p>
<p>Finally, <i>Theism</i> can just as little establish
dogmatically the possibility of natural purposes as a
key to Teleology; although it certainly is superior to
all other grounds of explanation in that, through the
Understanding which it ascribes to the original
Being, it rescues in the best way the purposiveness
of nature from Idealism, and introduces a causality
acting with design for its production.</p>
<p>But we must first prove satisfactorily to the
determinant Judgement the impossibility of the
unity of purpose in matter resulting from its mere
mechanism, before we are justified in placing the
ground of this beyond nature in a determinate way.
We can, however, advance no further than this.
In accordance with the constitution and limits of
our cognitive faculties (whilst we do not comprehend
even the first inner ground of this mechanism) we
must in no wise seek in matter a principle of
determinate purposive references; but no other
way of judging of the origination of its products<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
as natural purposes remains to us than that by
means of a supreme Understanding as cause of
the world. But this is only a ground for the
reflective, not for the determinant Judgement, and
can justify absolutely no objective assertion.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<h5 id="s74">§ 74. <i>The reason that we cannot treat the concept of
a Technic of nature dogmatically is the fact that
a natural purpose is inexplicable</i></h5></div></blockquote>
<p>We deal with a concept dogmatically (even
though it should be empirically conditioned) if we
consider it as contained under another concept of
the Object which constitutes a principle<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_113" id="FNanchor_113">113</a> of Reason,
and determine it in conformity with this. But we
deal with it merely critically, if we consider it only
in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently
to the subjective conditions of thinking it,
without undertaking to decide anything about its
Object. Dogmatic procedure with a concept is
then that which is conformable to law for the
determinant Judgement, critical procedure for the
reflective Judgement.</p>
<p>Now the concept of a thing as a natural purpose
is a concept which subsumes nature under a
causality only thinkable through Reason, in order to
judge in accordance with this principle about that
which is given of the Object in experience. But in
order to use it dogmatically for the determinant
Judgement, we must be assured first of the objective
reality of this concept, because otherwise we could
subsume no natural thing under it. Again, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
concept of a thing as a natural purpose is, no doubt,
empirically conditioned, <i>i.e.</i> only possible under
certain conditions given in experience, though not
to be abstracted therefrom; but it is a concept only
possible in accordance with a rational principle in
the judgement about the object. Its objective
reality, therefore (<i>i.e.</i> that an object in conformity
with it is possible), cannot be comprehended and
dogmatically established as such a principle; and we
do not know whether it is merely a sophistical and
objectively empty concept (<i>conceptus ratiocinans</i>),
or a rational concept, establishing a cognition
and confirmed by Reason (<i>conceptus ratiocinatus</i>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_114" id="FNanchor_114">114</a>
Therefore it cannot be dogmatically treated for the
determinant Judgement, <i>i.e.</i> it is not only impossible
to decide whether or not things of nature considered
as natural purposes require for their production a
causality of a quite peculiar kind (that acting on
design); but the question cannot even be put,
because the concept of a natural purpose is simply
not susceptible of proof through Reason as regards
its objective reality. That is, it is not constitutive
for the determinant Judgement, but merely regulative
for the reflective.</p>
<p>That it is not susceptible of proof is clear because
(as concept of a <i>natural product</i>) it embraces in
itself natural necessity, and at the same time (as
purpose) a contingency of the form of the Object
(in reference to the mere laws of nature) in the
very same thing. Hence, if there is to be no
contradiction here it must contain a ground for the
possibility of the thing in nature, and also a ground
of the possibility of this nature itself and of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
reference to something which, not being empirically
cognisable nature (supersensible), is therefore for
us not cognisable at all. [This is requisite] if it
is to be judged according to a different kind of
causality from that of natural mechanism when we
wish to establish its possibility. The concept of a
thing, then, as a natural purpose, is transcendent
<i>for the determinant Judgement</i>, if we consider the
Object through Reason (although for the reflective
Judgement it certainly may be immanent in respect
of the objects of experience). Hence for determinant
judgements objective reality cannot be supplied
to it; and so it is intelligible how all systems that
one may project for the dogmatic treatment of the
concept of natural purposes and of nature itself
[considered] as a whole connected together by
means of final causes, can decide nothing either by
objective affirmation or by objective denial. For if
things be subsumed under a concept that is merely
problematical, its synthetical predicates (<i>e.g.</i> in the
question whether the purpose of nature which we
conceive for the production of things is designed or
undesigned) can furnish only problematical judgements
of the Object, whether affirmative or negative;
and we do not know whether we are judging about
something or about nothing. The concept of a
causality through purposes (of art) has at all events
objective reality, and also the concept of a causality
according to the mechanism of nature. But the
concept of a causality of nature according to the
rule of purposes,—still more of a Being such as
cannot be given us in experience, a Being who is
the original cause of nature,—though it can be
thought without contradiction, yet is of no avail for
dogmatic determinations. For, since it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
derived from experience, and also is not requisite
for the possibility thereof, its objective reality can
in no way be assured. But even if this could be
done, how can I number among the products of
nature things which are definitely accounted products
of divine art, when it is just the incapacity of nature
to produce such things according to its own laws
that made it necessary to invoke a cause different
from it?</p>
<blockquote><div>
<h5 id="s75">§ 75. <i>The concept of an objective purposiveness of
nature is a critical principle of Reason for
the reflective Judgement</i></h5></div></blockquote>
<p>It is then one thing to say, “the production of
certain things of nature or that of collective nature
is only possible through a cause which determines
itself to action according to design”; and quite
another to say, “I can <i>according to the peculiar
constitution of my cognitive faculties</i> judge concerning
the possibility of these things and their production,
in no other fashion than by conceiving for this
a cause working according to design, <i>i.e.</i> a Being
which is productive in a way analogous to the
causality of an intelligence.” In the former case I
wish to establish something concerning the Object,
and am bound to establish the objective reality of
an assumed concept; in the latter, Reason only
determines the use of my cognitive faculties, conformably
to their peculiarities and to the essential
conditions of their range and their limits. Thus
the former principle is an objective proposition for
the determinant Judgement, the latter merely a
subjective proposition for the reflective Judgement,
<i>i.e.</i> a maxim which Reason prescribes to it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
We are in fact indispensably obliged to ascribe
the concept of design to nature if we wish to
investigate it, though only in its organised products,
by continuous observation; and this concept is
therefore an absolutely necessary maxim for the
empirical use of our Reason. It is plain that once
such a guiding thread for the study of nature is
admitted and verified, we must at least try the said
maxim of Judgement in nature as a whole; because
thereby many of nature’s laws might discover
themselves, which otherwise, on account of the
limitation of our insight into its inner mechanism,
would remain hidden. But though in regard to
this latter employment that maxim of Judgement is
certainly useful, it is not indispensable, for nature
as a whole is not given as organised (in the narrow
sense of the word above indicated). On the other
hand, in regard to those natural products, which
must be judged of as designed and not formed
otherwise (if we are to have empirical knowledge of
their inner constitution), this maxim of the reflective
Judgement is essentially necessary; because the very
thought of them as organised beings is impossible
without combining therewith the thought of their
designed production.</p>
<p>Now the concept of a thing whose existence or
form we represent to ourselves as possible under
the condition of a purpose is inseparably bound up
with the concept of its contingency (according to
natural laws). Hence the natural things that we
find possible only as purposes supply the best proof
of the contingency of the world-whole; to the
common Understanding and to the philosopher
alike they are the only valid ground of proof for its
dependence on and origin from a Being existing outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
the world—a Being who must also be intelligent
on account of that purposive form. Teleology then
finds the consummation of its investigations only in
Theology.</p>
<p>But what now in the end does the most complete
Teleology prove? Does it prove that there is such
an intelligent Being? No. It only proves that
according to the constitution of our cognitive faculties
and in the consequent combination of experience
with the highest principles of Reason, we can form
absolutely no concept of the possibility of such a
world [as this] save by thinking a <i>designedly-working</i>
supreme cause thereof. Objectively we cannot therefore
lay down the proposition, there is an intelligent
original Being; but only subjectively, for the use of
our Judgement in its reflection upon the purposes in
nature, which can be thought according to no other
principle than that of a designing causality of a
highest cause.</p>
<p>If we wished to establish on teleological grounds
the above proposition dogmatically we should be
beset with difficulties from which we could not
extricate ourselves. For then the proposition must
at bottom be reduced to the conclusion, that the
organised beings in the world are no otherwise
possible than by a designedly-working cause. And
we should unavoidably have to assert that, because
we can follow up these things in their causal combination
only under the Idea of purposes, and cognise
them only according to their conformity to law, we
are thereby justified in assuming this as a condition
necessary for every thinking and cognising being—a
condition consequently attaching to the Object and
not merely to our subject. But such an assertion
we do not succeed in sustaining. For, since we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
do not, properly speaking, <i>observe</i> the purposes in
nature as designed, but only in our reflection upon
its products <i>think</i> this concept as a guiding thread
for our Judgement, they are not given to us through
the Object. It is quite impossible for us <i>a priori</i> to
vindicate, as capable of assumption, such a concept
according to its objective reality. It remains therefore
a proposition absolutely resting upon subjective
conditions alone, viz. of the Judgement reflecting in
conformity with our cognitive faculties. If we expressed
this proposition dogmatically as objectively
valid, it would be: “There is a God.” But for us
men there is only permissible the limited formula:
“We cannot otherwise think and make comprehensible
the purposiveness which must lie at the
bottom of our cognition of the internal possibility
of many natural things, than by representing it and
the world in general as a product of an intelligent
cause, [a God].”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_115" id="FNanchor_115">115</a></p>
<p>Now if this proposition, based on an inevitably
necessary maxim of our Judgement, is completely
satisfactory from every <i>human</i> point of view for both
the speculative and practical use of our Reason, I
should like to know what we lose by not being able
to prove it as also valid for higher beings, from
objective grounds (which unfortunately are beyond
our faculties). It is indeed quite certain that we
cannot adequately cognise, much less explain, organised
beings and their internal possibility, according
to mere mechanical principles of nature; and we can
say boldly it is alike certain that it is absurd for men
to make any such attempt or to hope that another
<i>Newton</i> will arise in the future, who shall make
comprehensible by us the production of a blade of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
grass according to natural laws which no design has
ordered.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_116" id="FNanchor_116">116</a> We must absolutely deny this insight to
men. But then how do we know that in nature, if
we could penetrate to the principle by which it
specifies the universal laws known to us, there
<i>cannot</i> lie hidden (in its mere mechanism) a sufficient
ground of the possibility of organised beings without
supposing any design in their production? would
it not be judged by us presumptuous to say this?
Probabilities here are of no account when we have
to do with judgements of pure Reason.—We cannot
therefore judge objectively, either affirmatively or
negatively, concerning the proposition: “Does a
Being acting according to design lie at the basis of
what we rightly call natural purposes, as the cause
of the world (and consequently as its author)?” So
much only is sure, that if we are to judge according
to what is permitted us to see by our own proper
nature (the conditions and limitations of our Reason),
we can place at the basis of the possibility of these
natural purposes nothing else than an intelligent
Being. This alone is in conformity with the maxim
of our reflective Judgement and therefore with a
ground which, though subjective, is inseparably
attached to the human race.</p>
<h5 id="s76">§ 76. <i>Remark</i></h5>
<p>This consideration, which very well deserves to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
be worked out in detail in Transcendental Philosophy,
can come in here only in passing, by way of elucidation
(not as a proof of what is here proposed).</p>
<p>Reason is a faculty of principles and proceeds in
its extremest advance to the unconditioned; on the
other hand, the Understanding stands at its service
always only under a certain condition which must be
given. But without concepts of Understanding, to
which objective reality must be given, the Reason
cannot form any objective (synthetical) judgement;
and contains in itself, as theoretical Reason,
absolutely no constitutive but merely regulative
principles. We soon see that where the Understanding
cannot follow, the Reason is transcendent,
and shows itself in Ideas formerly established (as
regulative principles), but not in objectively valid
concepts. But the Understanding which cannot
keep pace with Reason but yet is requisite for the
validity of Objects, limits the validity of these Ideas
to the subject, although [extending it] generally to all
[subjects] of this kind. That is, the Understanding
limits their validity to the condition, that according
to the nature of our (human) cognitive faculties, or,
generally, according to the concept which we <i>ourselves</i>
can <i>make</i> of the faculty of a finite intelligent
being, nothing else can or must be thought; though
this is not to assert that the ground of such a judgement
lies in the Object. We shall adduce some
examples which, though they are too important and
difficult to impose them on the reader as proved
propositions, yet will give him material for thought
and may serve to elucidate what we are here
specially concerned with.</p>
<p>It is indispensably necessary for the human
Understanding to distinguish between the possibility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and the actuality of things. The ground for this
lies in the subject and in the nature of our cognitive
faculties. Such a distinction (between the possible
and the actual) would not be given were there not
requisite for knowledge two quite different elements,
Understanding for concepts and sensible intuition
for Objects corresponding to them. If our Understanding
were intuitive it would have no objects but
those which are actual. Concepts (which merely extend
to the possibility of an object) and sensible intuitions
(which give us something without allowing us
to cognise it thus as an object) would both disappear.
But now the whole of our distinction between the
merely possible and the actual rests on this, that the
former only signifies the positing of the representation
of a thing in respect of our concept, and, in
general, in respect of the faculty of thought; while
the latter signifies the positing of the thing in itself
[outside this concept].<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_117" id="FNanchor_117">117</a> The distinction, then, of
possible things from actual is one which has merely
subjective validity for the human Understanding,
because we can always have a thing in our thoughts
although it is [really] nothing, or we can represent a
thing as given although we have no concept of it.
The propositions therefore—that things can be
possible without being actual, and that consequently
no conclusion can be drawn as to actuality from
mere possibility—are quite valid for human Reason,
without thereby proving that this distinction lies
in things themselves. That this does not follow,
and that consequently these propositions, though
valid of Objects (in so far as our cognitive faculty, as
sensuously conditioned, busies itself with Objects of
sense), do not hold for things in general, appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
from the irrepressible demand of Reason to assume
something (the original ground) necessarily existing
as unconditioned, in which possibility and actuality
should no longer be distinguished, and for which
Idea our Understanding has absolutely no concept;
<i>i.e.</i> it can find no way of representing such a thing
and its manner of existence. For if the Understanding
<i>thinks</i> such a thing (which it may do at pleasure),
the thing is merely represented as possible. If it is
conscious of it as given in intuition, then is it actual;
but nothing as to its possibility is thus thought.
Hence the concept of an absolutely necessary Being
is no doubt an indispensable Idea of Reason, but yet
it is a problematical concept unattainable by the
human Understanding. It is indeed valid for the
employment of our cognitive faculties in accordance
with their peculiar constitution, but not valid of the
Object. Nor is it valid for every knowing being,
because I cannot presuppose in every such being
thought and intuition as two distinct conditions of
the exercise of its cognitive faculties, and consequently
as conditions of the possibility and actuality
of things. An Understanding into which this distinction
did not enter, might say: All Objects that
I know <i>are</i>, <i>i.e.</i> exist; and the possibility of some,
which yet do not exist (<i>i.e.</i> the contingency or the
contrasted necessity of those which do exist), might
never come into the representation of such a being
at all. But what makes it difficult for our Understanding
to treat its concepts here as Reason does,
is merely that for it, as human Understanding, that
is transcendent (<i>i.e.</i> impossible for the subjective
conditions of its cognition) which Reason makes
into a principle appertaining to the Object.—Here
the maxim always holds, that all Objects whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
cognition surpasses the faculty of the Understanding
are thought by us according to the subjective conditions
of the exercise of that faculty which necessarily
attach to our (human) nature. If judgements laid
down in this way (and there is no other alternative
in regard to transcendent concepts) cannot be constitutive
principles determining the Object as it is,
they will remain regulative principles adapted to the
human point of view, immanent in their exercise
and sure.</p>
<p>Just as Reason in the theoretical consideration
of nature must assume the Idea of an unconditioned
necessity of its original ground, so also it presupposes
in the practical [sphere] its own (in respect of nature)
unconditioned causality, or freedom, in that it is conscious
of its own moral command. Here the objective
necessity of the act, as a duty, is opposed to that
necessity which it would have as an event, if its
ground lay in nature and not in freedom (<i>i.e.</i> in the
causality of Reason). The morally absolutely necessary
act is regarded as physically quite contingent,
since that which <i>ought</i> necessarily to happen often
does not happen. It is clear then that it is owing
to the subjective constitution of our practical faculty
that the moral laws must be represented as commands,
and the actions conforming to them as duties; and
that Reason expresses this necessity not by an “<i>is</i>”
(happens), but by an “ought to be.” This would
not be the case were Reason considered as in its
causality independent of sensibility (as the subjective
condition of its application to objects of nature), and
so as cause in an intelligible world entirely in agreement
with the moral law. For in such a world there
would be no distinction between “ought to do” and
“does,” between a practical law of that which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
possible through us, and the theoretical law of that
which is actual through us. Though, therefore, an
intelligible world in which everything would be
actual merely because (as something good) it is
possible, together with freedom as its formal condition,
is for us a transcendent concept, not available
as a constitutive principle to determine an Object
and its objective reality; yet, because of the constitution
of our (in part sensuous) nature and faculty it
is, so far as we can represent it in accordance with the
constitution of our Reason, for us and for all rational
beings that have a connexion with the world of
sense, a universal <i>regulative principle</i>. This principle
does not objectively determine the constitution of
freedom, as a form of causality, but it makes the
rule of actions according to that Idea a command
for every one, with no less validity than if it did
so determine it.</p>
<p>In the same way we may concede thus much as
regards the case in hand. Between natural mechanism
and the Technic of nature, <i>i.e.</i> its purposive
connexion, we should find no distinction, were it not
that our Understanding is of the kind that must
proceed from the universal to the particular. The
Judgement then in respect of the particular can cognise
no purposiveness and, consequently, can form no
determinant judgements, without having a universal
law under which to subsume that particular. Now
the particular, as such, contains something contingent
in respect of the universal, while yet Reason requires
unity and conformity to law in the combination of
particular laws of nature. This conformity of the
contingent to law is called purposiveness; and the
derivation of particular laws from the universal, as
regards their contingent element, is impossible <i>a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
priori</i> through a determination of the concept of
the Object. Hence, the concept of the purposiveness
of nature in its products is necessary for human
Judgement in respect of nature, but has not to do
with the determination of Objects. It is, therefore,
a subjective principle of Reason for the Judgement,
which as regulative (not constitutive) is just as
necessarily valid for our <i>human Judgement</i> as if it
were an objective principle.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<h5 id="s77">§ 77. <i>Of the peculiarity of the human Understanding,
by means of which the concept of a natural
purpose is possible</i></h5></div></blockquote>
<p>We have brought forward in the <i>Remark</i>
peculiarities of our cognitive faculties (even the
higher ones) which we are easily led to transfer as
objective predicates to the things themselves. But
they concern Ideas, no object adequate to which
can be given in experience, and they could only
serve as regulative principles in the pursuit of
experience. This is the case with the concept
of a natural purpose, which concerns the cause of
the possibility of such a predicate, which cause can
only lie in the Idea. But the result corresponding
to it (<i>i.e.</i> the product) is given in nature; and the
concept of a causality of nature as of a being acting
according to purposes seems to make the Idea
of a natural purpose into a constitutive principle,
which Idea has thus something different from all
other Ideas.</p>
<p>This difference consists, however, in the fact
that the Idea in question is not a rational principle
for the Understanding but for the Judgement. It
is, therefore, merely the application of an Understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
in general to possible objects of experience,
in cases where the judgement can only be reflective,
not determinant, and where, consequently, the object,
although given in experience, cannot be <i>determinately
judged</i> in conformity with the Idea (not to say with
complete adequacy), but can only be reflected on.</p>
<p>There emerges, therefore, a peculiarity of <i>our</i>
(human) Understanding in respect of the Judgement
in its reflection upon things of nature. But if this
be so, the Idea of a possible Understanding different
from the human must be fundamental here. (Just
so in the Critique of Pure Reason we must have in
our thoughts another possible [kind of] intuition, if
ours is to be regarded as a particular species for which
objects are only valid as phenomena.) And so we
are able to say: Certain natural products, from the
special constitution of our Understanding, <i>must be
considered by us</i>, in regard to their possibility, as if
produced designedly and as purposes. But we do
not, therefore, demand that there should be actually
given a particular cause which has the representation
of a purpose as its determining ground; and
we do not deny that an Understanding, different
from (<i>i.e.</i> higher than) the human, might find the
ground of the possibility of such products of nature
in the mechanism of nature, <i>i.e.</i> in a causal combination
for which an Understanding is not explicitly
assumed as cause.</p>
<p>We have now to do with the relation of <i>our</i>
Understanding to the Judgement; viz. we seek for
a certain contingency in the constitution of our
Understanding, to which we may point as a peculiarity
distinguishing it from other possible Understandings.</p>
<p>This contingency is found, naturally enough, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
the <i>particular</i>, which the Judgement is to bring
under the <i>universal</i> of the concepts of Understanding.
For the universal of <i>our</i> (human) Understanding
does not determine the particular, and it is contingent
in how many ways different things which agree in
a common characteristic may come before our
perception. Our Understanding is a faculty of
concepts, <i>i.e.</i> a discursive Understanding, for which
it obviously must be contingent of what kind and
how very different the particular may be that
can be given to it in nature and brought under its
concepts. But now intuition also belongs to knowledge,
and a faculty of a <i>complete spontaneity of
intuition</i> would be a cognitive faculty distinct from
sensibility, and quite independent of it, in other
words, an Understanding in the most general sense.
Thus we can think an <i>intuitive</i> Understanding
[negatively, merely as not discursive<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_118" id="FNanchor_118">118</a>], which does
not proceed from the universal to the particular,
and so to the individual (through concepts). For
it that contingency of the accordance of nature in
its products according to <i>particular</i> laws with the
Understanding would not be met with; and it is
this contingency that makes it so hard for our
Understanding to reduce the manifold of nature
to the unity of knowledge. This reduction our
Understanding can only accomplish by bringing
natural characteristics into a very contingent
correspondence with our faculty of concepts, of
which an intuitive Understanding would have no
need.</p>
<p>Our Understanding has then this peculiarity as
concerns the Judgement, that in cognition by it the
particular is not determined by the universal and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
cannot therefore be derived from it; but at the same
time this particular in the manifold of nature must
accord with the universal (by means of concepts and
laws) so that it may be capable of being subsumed
under it. This accordance under such circumstances
must be very contingent and without definite principle
as concerns the Judgement.</p>
<p>In order now to be able at least to think the possibility
of such an accordance of things of nature with
our Judgement (which accordance we represent as
contingent and consequently as only possible by means
of a purpose directed thereto), we must at the same
time think of another Understanding, by reference to
which and apart from any purpose ascribed to it, we
may represent as <i>necessary</i> that accordance of natural
laws with our Judgement, which for our Understanding
is only thinkable through the medium of purposes.</p>
<p>In fact our Understanding has the property of
proceeding in its cognition, <i>e.g.</i> of the cause of a
product, from the <i>analytical-universal</i> (concepts) to
the particular (the given empirical intuition). Thus
as regards the manifold of the latter it determines
nothing, but must await this determination by
the Judgement, which subsumes the empirical
intuition (if the object is a natural product) under
the concept. We can however think an Understanding
which, being, not like ours, discursive, but
intuitive, proceeds from the <i>synthetical-universal</i>
(the intuition of a whole as such) to the particular,
<i>i.e.</i> from the whole to the parts. The <i>contingency</i> of
the combination of the parts, in order that a definite
form of the whole shall be possible, is not implied
by such an Understanding and its representation of
the whole. Our Understanding requires this because
it must proceed from the parts as universally conceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
grounds to different forms possible to be
subsumed under them, as consequences. According
to the constitution of our Understanding a real
whole of nature is regarded only as the effect of the
concurrent motive powers of the parts. Suppose
then that we wish not to represent the possibility of
the whole as dependent on that of the parts (after
the manner of our discursive Understanding), but
according to the standard of the intuitive (original)
Understanding to represent the possibility of the
parts (according to their constitution and combination)
as dependent on that of the whole. In accordance
with the above peculiarity of our Understanding
it cannot happen that the whole shall contain the
ground of the possibility of the connexion of the
parts (which would be a contradiction in discursive
cognition), but only that the <i>representation</i> of a
whole may contain the ground of the possibility of
its form and the connexion of the parts belonging
to it. Now such a whole would be an effect (<i>product</i>)
the <i>representation</i> of which is regarded as the <i>cause</i>
of its possibility; but the product of a cause whose
determining ground is merely the representation of
its effect is called a purpose. Hence it is merely a
consequence of the particular constitution of our
Understanding, that it represents products of nature
as possible, according to a different kind of causality
from that of the natural laws of matter, namely, that
of purposes and final causes. Hence also this
principle has not to do with the possibility of such
things themselves (even when considered as phenomena)
according to the manner of their production,
but merely with the judgement upon them which is
possible to our Understanding. Here we see at
once why it is that in natural science we are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
long contented with an explanation of the products
of nature by a causality according to purposes. For
there we desire to judge of natural production merely
in a manner conformable to our faculty of judging,
<i>i.e.</i> to the reflective Judgement, and not in reference
to things themselves on behalf of the determinant
Judgement. It is here not at all requisite to prove
that such an <i>intellectus archetypus</i> is possible, but
only that we are led to the Idea of it,—which
contains no contradiction,—in contrast to our discursive
Understanding which has need of images
(<i>intellectus ectypus</i>) and to the contingency of its
constitution.</p>
<p>If we consider a material whole, according to its
form, as a product of the parts with their powers
and faculties of combining with one another (as well
as of bringing in foreign materials), we represent
to ourselves a mechanical mode of producing it.
But in this way no concept emerges of a whole
as purpose, whose internal possibility presupposes
throughout the Idea of a whole on which depend
the constitution and mode of action of the parts, as
we must represent to ourselves an organised body.
It does not follow indeed, as has been shown, that the
mechanical production of such a body is impossible;
for to say so would be to say that it would be
impossible (contradictory) for <i>any Understanding</i> to
represent to itself such a unity in the connexion of
the manifold, without the Idea of the unity being
at the same time its producing cause, <i>i.e.</i> without
designed production. This, however, would follow
in fact if we were justified in regarding material
beings as things in themselves. For then the unity
that constitutes the ground of the possibility of
natural formations would be simply the unity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
space. But space is no real ground of the products,
but only their formal condition, although it has this
similarity to the real ground which we seek that in
it no part can be determined except in relation to the
whole (the representation of which therefore lies at
the ground of the possibility of the parts). But now
it is at least possible to consider the material world
as mere phenomenon, and to think as its substrate
something like a thing in itself (which is not phenomenon),
and to attach to this a corresponding
intellectual intuition (even though it is not ours).
Thus there would be, although incognisable by us,
a supersensible real ground for nature, to which we
ourselves belong. In this we consider according to
mechanical laws what is necessary in nature regarded
as an object of Sense; but we consider according to
teleological laws the agreement and unity of its
particular laws and its forms—which in regard to
mechanism we must judge contingent—regarded as
objects of Reason (in fact the whole of nature as a
system). Thus we should judge nature according
to two different kinds of principles without the
mechanical way of explanation being shut out by
the teleological, as if they contradicted one another.</p>
<p>From this we are enabled to see what otherwise,
though we could easily surmise it, could with difficulty
be maintained with certainty and proved, viz. that
the principle of a mechanical derivation of purposive
natural products is consistent with the teleological,
but in no way enables us to dispense with it. In a
thing that we must judge as a natural purpose (an
organised being) we can no doubt try all the known
and yet to be discovered laws of mechanical production,
and even hope to make good progress therewith;
but we can never get rid of the call for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
quite different ground of production for the possibility
of such a product, viz. causality by means of
purposes. Absolutely no human Reason (in fact
no finite Reason like ours in quality, however much
it may surpass it in degree) can hope to understand
the production of even a blade of grass by mere
mechanical causes. As regards the possibility of
such an object, the teleological connexion of causes
and effects is quite indispensable for the Judgement,
even for studying it by the clue of experience. For
external objects as phenomena an adequate ground
related to purposes cannot be met with; this, although
it lies in nature, must only be sought in the supersensible
substrate of nature, from all possible insight
into which we are cut off. Hence it is absolutely
impossible for us to produce from nature itself
grounds of explanation for purposive combinations;
and it is necessary by the constitution of the human
cognitive faculties to seek the supreme ground of
these purposive combinations in an original Understanding
as the cause of the world.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<h5 id="s78">§ 78. <i>Of the union of the principle of the universal
mechanism of matter with the teleological principle
in the Technic of nature</i></h5></div></blockquote>
<p>It is infinitely important for Reason not to let
slip the mechanism of nature in its products, and in
their explanation not to pass it by, because without
it no insight into the nature of things can be attained.
Suppose it admitted that a supreme Architect
immediately created the forms of nature as they
have been from the beginning, or that He predetermined
those which in the course of nature continually
form themselves on the same model. Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
knowledge of nature is not thus in the least furthered,
because we cannot know the mode of action of that
Being and the Ideas which are to contain the
principles of the possibility of natural beings, and
we cannot by them explain nature as from above
downwards (<i>a priori</i>). And if, starting from the
forms of the objects of experience, from below
upwards (<i>a posteriori</i>), we wish to explain the
purposiveness, which we believe is met with in experience,
by appealing to a cause working in accordance
with purposes, then is our explanation quite
tautological and we are only mocking Reason with
words. Indeed when we lose ourselves with this
way of explanation in the transcendent, whither
natural knowledge cannot follow, Reason is seduced
into poetical extravagance, which it is its peculiar
destination to avoid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is just as necessary a
maxim of Reason not to pass by the principle of
purposes in the products of nature. For, although
it does not make their mode of origination any more
comprehensible, yet it is a heuristic principle for
investigating the particular laws of nature; supposing
even that we wish to make no use of it for
explaining nature itself,—in which we still always
speak only of natural purposes, although it apparently
exhibits a designed unity of purpose,—<i>i.e.</i>
without seeking beyond nature the ground of the
possibility of these particular laws. But since we
must come in the end to this latter question, it is
just as necessary to think for nature a particular kind
of causality which does not present itself in it, as the
mechanism of natural causes which does. To the
receptivity of several forms, different from those of
which matter is susceptible by mechanism, must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
added a spontaneity of a cause (which therefore
cannot be matter), without which no ground can be
assigned for those forms. No doubt Reason, before
it takes this step, must proceed with caution, and not
try to explain teleologically every Technic of nature,
<i>i.e.</i> every productive faculty of nature which displays
in itself (as in regular bodies) purposiveness of figure
to our mere apprehension; but must always regard
such as so far mechanically possible. But on that
account to wish entirely to exclude the teleological
principle, and to follow simple mechanism only—in
cases where, in the rational investigation of the possibility
of natural forms through their causes, purposiveness
shows itself quite undeniably as the reference
to a different kind of causality—to do this must make
Reason fantastic, and send it wandering among
chimeras of unthinkable natural faculties; just as a
mere teleological mode of explanation which takes
no account of natural mechanism makes it visionary.</p>
<p>In the same natural thing both principles cannot
be connected as fundamental propositions of explanation
(deduction) of one by the other, <i>i.e.</i> they do not
unite for the determinant Judgement as dogmatical
and constitutive principles of insight into nature. If
I choose, <i>e.g.</i> to regard a maggot as the product of
the mere mechanism of nature (of the new formation
that it produces of itself, when its elements are set
free by corruption), I cannot derive the same product
from the same matter as from a causality that acts
according to purposes. Conversely, if I regard the
same product as a natural purpose, I cannot count
on any mechanical mode of its production and regard
this as the constitutive principle of my judgement
upon its possibility, and so unite both principles.
One method of explanation excludes the other;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
even supposing that objectively both grounds of
the possibility of such a product rested on a single
ground, to which we did not pay attention. The
principle which should render possible the compatibility
of both in judging of nature must be placed
in that which lies outside both (and consequently
outside the possible empirical representation of
nature), but yet contains their ground, <i>i.e.</i> in the
supersensible; and each of the two methods of
explanation must be referred thereto. Now of this
we can have no concept but the indeterminate concept
of a ground, which makes the judging of nature
by empirical laws possible, but which we cannot
determine more nearly by any predicate. Hence the
union of both principles cannot rest upon a ground
of <i>explanation</i> of the possibility of a product according
to given laws, for the <i>determinant</i> Judgement, but
only upon a ground of its <i>exposition</i> for the <i>reflective</i>
Judgement.—To explain is to derive from a principle,
which therefore we must clearly know and of which
we can give an account. No doubt the principle of
the mechanism of nature and that of its causality
in one and the same natural product must coalesce
in a single higher principle, which is their common
source, because otherwise they could not subsist
side by side in the observation of nature. But if
this principle, objectively common to the two, which
therefore warrants the association of the maxims of
natural investigation depending on both, be such
that, though it can be pointed to, it cannot be
determinately known nor clearly put forward for
use in cases which arise, then from such a principle
we can draw no explanation, <i>i.e.</i> no clear and
determinate derivation of the possibility of a natural
product in accordance with those two heterogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
principles. But now the principle common to
the mechanical and teleological derivations is the
<i>supersensible</i>, which we must place at the basis of
nature, regarded as phenomenon. And of this, in a
theoretical point of view, we cannot form the smallest
positive determinate concept. It cannot, therefore,
in any way be explained how, according to it as
principle, nature (in its particular laws) constitutes
for us one system, which can be cognised as possible
either by the principle of physical development or
by that of final causes. If it happens that objects
of nature present themselves which cannot be
thought by us, as regards their possibility, according
to the principle of mechanism (which always has
a claim on a natural being), without relying on
teleological propositions, we can only make an hypothesis.
Namely, we suppose that we may hopefully
investigate natural laws with reference to both
(according as the possibility of its product is
cognisable by our Understanding by one or the
other principle), without stumbling at the apparent
contradiction which comes into view between the
principles by which they are judged. For at least
the possibility is assured that both may be united
objectively in one principle, since they concern phenomena
that presuppose a supersensible ground.</p>
<p>Mechanism, then, and the teleological (designed)
Technic of nature, in respect of the same product
and its possibility, may stand under a common
supreme principle of nature in particular laws. But
since this principle is <i>transcendent</i> we cannot, because
of the limitation of our Understanding, unite both
principles <i>in the explanation</i> of the same production
of nature even if the inner possibility of this product
is only <i>intelligible</i> [verständlich] through a causality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
according to purposes (as is the case with organised
matter). We revert then to the above fundamental
proposition of Teleology. According to the constitution
of the human Understanding, no other
than designedly-working causes can be assumed
for the possibility of organised beings in nature;
and the mere mechanism of nature cannot be
adequate to the explanation of these its products.
But we do not attempt to decide anything by this
fundamental proposition as to the possibility of such
things themselves.</p>
<p>This is only a maxim of the reflective, not of
the determinant Judgement; consequently only subjectively
valid for us, not objectively for the possibility
of things themselves of this kind (in which
both kinds of production may well cohere in one
and the same ground). Further, without any concept,—besides
the teleologically conceived method
of production,—of a simultaneously presented
mechanism of nature, no judgement can be passed
on this kind of production as a natural product.
Hence the above maxim leads to the necessity of
an unification of both principles in judging of things
as natural purposes in themselves, but does not lead
us to substitute one for the other either altogether
or in certain parts. For in the place of what is
thought (at least by us) as possible only by design
we cannot set mechanism, and in the place of what
is cognised as mechanically necessary we cannot set
contingency, which would need a purpose as its determining
ground; but we can only subordinate the
one (Mechanism) to the other (designed Technic),
which may quite well be the case according to the
transcendental principle of the purposiveness of
nature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
For where purposes are thought as grounds of
the possibility of certain things, we must assume
also means, whose law of working requires <i>for
itself</i> nothing presupposing a purpose,—a mechanical
law—and yet can be a subordinate cause of designed
effects. Thus—in the organic products
of nature, and specially when prompted by their infinite
number, we assume (at least as a permissible
hypothesis) design in the combination of natural
causes by particular laws as a <i>universal principle</i>
of the reflective Judgement for the whole of
nature (the world),—we can think a great and
indeed universal combination of mechanical with
teleological laws in the productions of nature,
without interchanging the principles by which they
are judged or putting one in the place of the other.
For, in a teleological judgement, the matter, even if
the form that it assumes be judged possible only
by design, can also, conformably to the mechanical
laws of its nature, be subordinated as a means to
the represented purpose. But, since the ground of
this compatibility lies in that which is neither one
nor the other (neither mechanism nor purposive
combination), but is the supersensible substrate of
nature of which we know nothing, the two ways of
representing the possibility of such Objects are not
to be blended together by our (human) Reason.
However, we cannot judge of their possibility
otherwise than by judging them as ultimately
resting on a supreme Understanding by the
connexion of final causes; and thus the teleological
method of explanation is not eliminated.</p>
<p>Now it is quite indeterminate, and for our
Understanding always indeterminable, how much
the mechanism of nature does as a means towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
each final design in nature. However, on account
of the above-mentioned intelligible principle of
the possibility of a nature in general, it may be
assumed that it is possible throughout according to
the two kinds of universally accordant laws (the
physical and those of final causes), although we
cannot see into the way how this takes place.
Hence we do not know how far the mechanical
method of explanation which is possible for us may
extend. So much only is certain that, so far as we
can go in this direction, it must always be inadequate
for things that we once recognise as natural
purposes; and therefore we must, by the constitution
of our Understanding, subordinate these
grounds collectively to a teleological principle.</p>
<p>Hereon is based a privilege, and on account of
the importance which the study of nature by the
principle of mechanism has for the theoretical use of
our Reason, also an appeal. We should explain all
products and occurrences in nature, even the most
purposive, by mechanism as far as is in our power
(the limits of which we cannot specify in this kind
of investigation). But at the same time we are
not to lose sight of the fact that those things which
we cannot even state for investigation except under
the concept of a purpose of Reason, must, in conformity
with the essential constitution of our
Reason, mechanical causes notwithstanding, be
subordinated by us finally to causality in accordance
with purposes.</p>

<h3 title="METHDOLOGY OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT." id="appendix_2">METHODOLOGY OF
THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT.<a class="fnanchor smaller pginternal" href="#Footnote_119" id="FNanchor_119">119</a></h3>
<h5 id="s79">§ 79. <i>Whether teleology must be treated as if it
belonged to the doctrine of nature</i></h5>
<p>Every science must have its definite position in
the encyclopaedia of all the sciences. If it is a
philosophical science its position must be either in
the theoretical or practical part. If again it has
its place in the former of these, it must be either in
the doctrine of nature, so far as it concerns that
which can be an object of experience (in the
doctrine of bodies, the doctrine of the soul, or the
universal science of the world), or in the doctrine
of God (the original ground of the world as the
complex of all objects of experience).</p>
<p>Now the question is, what place is due to
Teleology? Does it belong to Natural Science
(properly so called) or to Theology? One of the
two it must be; for no science belongs to the
transition from one to the other, because this
transition only marks the articulation or organisation
of the system, and not a place in it.</p>
<p>That it does not belong to Theology as a part
thereof, although it may be made of the most
important use therein, is self-evident. For it has as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
its objects, natural productions, and their cause, and
although it refers at the same time to the latter as
to a ground lying outside of and beyond nature (a
Divine Author), yet it does not do this for the
determinant but only for the reflective Judgement in
the consideration of nature (in order to guide our
judgement on things in the world by means of such
an Idea as a regulative principle, in conformity with
the human Understanding).</p>
<p>But it appears to belong just as little to Natural
Science, which needs determinant and not merely
reflective principles in order to supply objective
grounds for natural effects. In fact, nothing is
gained for the theory of nature or the mechanical
explanation of its phenomena by means of its
effective causes, by considering them as connected
according to the relation of purposes. The
exhibition of the purposes of nature in its products,
so far as they constitute a system according to
teleological concepts, properly belongs only to a
description of nature which is drawn up in accordance
with a particular guiding thread. Here
Reason, no doubt, accomplishes a noble work,
instructive and practically purposive in many points
of view; but it gives no information as to the
origin and the inner possibility of these forms,
which is the special business of theoretical Natural
Science. Teleology, therefore, as science, belongs
to no Doctrine, but only to Criticism; and to the
criticism of a special cognitive faculty, viz. Judgement.
But so far as it contains principles <i>a priori</i>, it
can and must furnish the method by which nature
must be judged according to the principle of final
causes. Hence its Methodology has at least negative
influence upon the procedure in theoretical Natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Science, and also upon the relation which this can
have in Metaphysic to Theology as its propaedeutic.</p>
<blockquote><div>
<h5 id="s80">§ 80. <i>Of the necessary subordination of the mechanical
to the teleological principle in the explanation
of a thing as a natural purpose</i></h5></div></blockquote>
<p>The <i>privilege of aiming at</i> a merely mechanical
method of explanation of all natural products is in
itself quite unlimited; but the <i>faculty of attaining</i>
thereto is by the constitution of our Understanding,
so far as it has to do with things as natural purposes,
not only very much limited but also clearly bounded.
For, according to a principle of the Judgement, by
this process alone nothing can be accomplished
towards an explanation of these things; and consequently
the judgement upon such products must
always be at the same time subordinated by us to a
teleological principle.</p>
<p>It is therefore rational, even meritorious, to
pursue natural mechanism, in respect of the explanation
of natural products, so far as can be done
with probability; and if we give up the attempt it is
not because it is impossible <i>in itself</i> to meet in this
path with the purposiveness of nature, but only
because it is impossible <i>for us</i> as men. For there
would be required for that an intuition other than
sensuous, and a determinate knowledge of the
intelligible substrate of nature from which a ground
could be assigned for the mechanism of phenomena
according to particular laws, which quite surpasses
our faculties.</p>
<p>Hence if the naturalist would not waste his
labour he must in judging of things, the concept of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
any of which is indubitably established as a natural
purpose (organised beings), always lay down as
basis an original organisation, which uses that very
mechanism in order to produce fresh organised
forms or to develop the existing ones into new
shapes (which, however, always result from that
purpose and conformably to it).</p>
<p>It is praiseworthy by the aid of comparative
anatomy to go through the great creation of organised
natures, in order to see whether there may not
be in it something similar to a system and also in
accordance with the principle of production. For
otherwise we should have to be content with the
mere principle of judgement (which gives no insight
into their production) and, discouraged, to give up
all claim to <i>natural insight</i> in this field. The agreement
of so many genera of animals in a certain
common schema, which appears to be fundamental
not only in the structure of their bones but also in
the disposition of their remaining parts,—so that
with an admirable simplicity of original outline, a
great variety of species has been produced by the
shortening of one member and the lengthening of
another, the involution of this part and the evolution
of that,—allows a ray of hope, however faint, to
penetrate into our minds, that here something may
be accomplished by the aid of the principle of the
mechanism of nature (without which there can be no
natural science in general). This analogy of forms,
which with all their differences seem to have been
produced according to a common original type,
strengthens our suspicions of an actual relationship
between them in their production from a common
parent, through the gradual approximation of one
animal-genus to another—from those in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
principle of purposes seems to be best authenticated,
<i>i.e.</i> from man, down to the polype, and again from
this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to the
lowest stage of nature noticeable by us, viz. to crude
matter. And so the whole Technic of nature, which
is so incomprehensible to us in organised beings
that we believe ourselves compelled to think a
different principle for it, seems to be derived from
matter and its powers according to mechanical laws
(like those by which it works in the formation of
crystals).</p>
<p>Here it is permissible for the <i>archaeologist</i> of
nature to derive from the surviving traces of its
oldest revolutions, according to all its mechanism
known or supposed by him, that great family of
creatures (for so we must represent them if the said
thoroughgoing relationship is to have any ground).
He can suppose the bosom of mother earth, as she
passed out of her chaotic state (like a great animal),
to have given birth in the beginning to creatures of
less purposive form, that these again gave birth to
others which formed themselves with greater adaptation
to their place of birth and their relations to each
other; until this womb becoming torpid and ossified,
limited its births to definite species not further
modifiable, and the manifoldness remained as it
was at the end of the operation of that fruitful
formative power.—Only he must still in the end
ascribe to this universal mother an organisation
purposive in respect of all these creatures; otherwise
it would not be possible to think the possibility of
the purposive form of the products of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_120" id="FNanchor_120">120</a> He has then only pushed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
further back the ground of explanation and cannot
pretend to have made the development of those two
kingdoms independent of the condition of final
causes.</p>
<p>Even as concerns the variation to which certain
individuals of organised genera are accidentally
subjected, if we find that the character so changed
is hereditary and is taken up into the generative
power, then we cannot pertinently judge the variation
to be anything else than an occasional development
of purposive capacities originally present in
the species with a view to the preservation of the
race. For in the complete inner purposiveness of
an organised being, the generation of its like is
closely bound up with the condition of taking
nothing up into the generative power which does
not belong, in such a system of purposes, to one of
its undeveloped original capacities. Indeed, if we
depart from this principle, we cannot know with
certainty whether several parts of the form which is
now apparent in a species have not a contingent and
unpurposive origin; and the principle of Teleology,
to judge nothing in an organised being as unpurposive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
which maintains it in its propagation, would
be very unreliable in its application and would be
valid solely for the original stock (of which we have
no further knowledge).</p>
<p><i>Hume</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_121" id="FNanchor_121">121</a> takes exception to those who find it requisite
to assume for all such natural purposes a teleological
principle of judgement, <i>i.e.</i> an architectonic
Understanding. He says that it may fairly be asked:
how is such an Understanding possible? How can
the manifold faculties and properties that constitute
the possibility of an Understanding, which has at the
same time executive force, be found so purposively
together in one Being? But this objection is without
weight. For the whole difficulty which surrounds
the question concerning the first production of a
thing containing in itself purposes and only comprehensible
by means of them, rests on the further
question as to the unity of the ground of the combination
in this product of the various elements [des
Mannichfaltigen] which are <i>external to one another</i>.
For if this ground be placed in the Understanding of
a producing cause as simple substance, the question,
so far as it is teleological, is sufficiently answered;
but if the cause be sought merely in matter as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
aggregate of many substances external to one
another, the unity of the principle is quite wanting
for the internally purposive form of its formation,
and the <i>autocracy</i> of matter in productions which
can only be conceived by our Understanding as
purposes is a word without meaning.</p>
<p>Hence it comes to pass that those who seek a
supreme ground of possibility for the objectively-purposive
forms of matter, without attributing to it
Understanding, either make the world-whole into
a single all-embracing substance (Pantheism), or
(which is only a more determinate explanation of
the former) into a complex of many determinations
inhering in a single <i>simple substance</i> (Spinozism);
merely in order to satisfy that condition of all
purposiveness—the <i>unity</i> of ground. Thus they do
justice indeed to <i>one</i> condition of the problem, viz.
the unity in the purposive combination, by means of
the mere ontological concept of a simple substance;
but they adduce nothing for the <i>other</i> condition,
viz. the relation of this substance to its result as
<i>purpose</i>, through which relation that ontological
ground is to be more closely determined in respect
of the question at issue. Hence they answer <i>the
whole</i> question in no way. It remains absolutely
unanswerable (for our Reason) if we do not represent
that original ground of things, as simple
<i>substance</i>; its property which has reference to the
specific constitution of the forms of nature grounded
thereon, viz. its purposive unity, as the property of
an intelligent substance; and the relation of these
forms to this intelligence (on account of the contingency
which we ascribe to everything that we think
possible only as a purpose) as that of <i>causality</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s81">§ 81. <i>Of the association of mechanism with the teleological
principle in the explanation of a natural
purpose as a natural product</i></h5>
<p>According to the preceding paragraphs the
mechanism of nature alone does not enable us to
think the possibility of an organised being; but (at
least according to the constitution of our cognitive
faculty) it must be originally subordinated to a
cause working designedly. But, just as little is the
mere teleological ground of such a being sufficient
for considering it and judging it as a product of
nature, if the mechanism of the latter be not associated
with the former, like the instrument of a cause
working designedly, to whose purposes nature is
subordinated in its mechanical laws. The possibility
of such a unification of two quite different
kinds of causality,—of nature in its universal conformity
to law with an Idea which limits it to a
particular form, for which it contains no ground in
itself—is not comprehended by our Reason. It lies
in the supersensible substrate of nature, of which we
can determine nothing positively, except that it is
the being in itself of which we merely know the
phenomenon. But the principle, “all that we assume
as belonging to this nature (<i>phenomenon</i>) and
as its product, must be thought as connected therewith
according to mechanical laws,” has none the
less force, because without this kind of causality
organised beings (as purposes of nature) would not
be natural products.</p>
<p>Now if the teleological principle of the production
of these beings be assumed (as is inevitable),
we can place at the basis of the cause of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
internally purposive form either <i>Occasionalism</i> or
<i>Pre-established Harmony</i>. According to the former
the Supreme Cause of the world would, conformably
to its Idea, furnish immediately the organic
formation on the occasion of every union of intermingling
materials. According to the latter it
would, in the original products of its wisdom, only
have supplied the capacity by means of which an
organic being produces another of like kind, and
the species perpetually maintains itself; whilst the
loss of individuals is continually replaced by that
nature which at the same time works towards their
destruction. If we assume the Occasionalism of the
production of organised beings, all nature is quite
lost, and with it all employment of Reason in judging
of the possibility of such products; hence we may
suppose that no one will adopt this system, who has
anything to do with philosophy.</p>
<p>[The theory of] <i>Pre-established Harmony</i> may
proceed in two different ways. It regards every
organised being as generated by one of like kind,
either as an <i>educt</i> or a <i>product</i>. The system which
regards generations as mere educts is called the
theory of <i>individual preformation</i> or the theory of
<i>evolution</i>: that which regards them as products is
entitled the system of <i>epigenesis</i>. This latter may
also be entitled the system of <i>generic preformation</i>,
because the productive faculty of the generator and
consequently the specific form would be <i>virtually</i>
performed according to the inner purposive capacities
which are part of its stock. In correspondence with
this the opposite theory of individual preformations
would be better entitled the <i>theory of involution</i>.</p>
<p>The advocates of the <i>theory of evolution</i>, who
remove every individual from the formative power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
of nature, in order to make it come immediately
from the hand of the Creator, would, however, not
venture to regard this as happening according to
the hypothesis of Occasionalism. For according to
this the copulation is a mere formality, <i>à propos</i> of
which a supreme intelligent Cause of the world has
concluded to form a fruit immediately by his hand,
and only to leave to the mother its development and
nourishment. They declare themselves for preformation;
as if it were not all the same, whether a
supernatural origin is assigned to these forms in the
beginning or in the course of the world. On the
contrary, a great number of supernatural arrangements
would be spared by occasional creation, which
would be requisite, in order that the embryo formed
in the beginning of the world might not be injured
throughout the long period of its development by the
destructive powers of nature, and might keep itself
unharmed; and there would also be requisite an incalculably
greater number of such preformed beings
than would ever be developed, and with them many
creations would be made without need and without
purpose. They would, however, be willing to leave
at least something to nature, so as not to fall into a
complete Hyperphysic which can dispense with all
natural explanations. It is true, they hold so fast
by their Hyperphysic that they find even in abortions
(which it is quite impossible to take for purposes of
nature) an admirable purposiveness; though it be
only directed to the fact that an anatomist would
take exception to it as a purposeless purposiveness,
and would feel a disheartened wonder thereat. But
the production of hybrids could absolutely not be
accommodated with the system of preformation;
and to the seeds of the male creature, to which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
had attributed nothing but the mechanical property
of serving as the first means of nourishment for the
embryo, they must attribute in addition a purposive
formative power, which in the case of the product of
two creatures of the same genus they would concede
to neither parent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even if we do not recognise
the great superiority which the theory of <i>Epigenesis</i>
has over the former as regards the empirical grounds
of its proof, still prior to proof Reason views this
way of explanation with peculiar favour. For in
respect of the things which we can only represent
as possible originally according to the causality of
purposes, at least as concerns their propagation, this
theory regards nature as self-producing, not merely
as self-evolving: and so with the least expenditure
of the supernatural leaves to nature all that follows
after the first beginning (though without determining
anything about this first beginning by which Physic
generally is thwarted, however it may essay its
explanation by a chain of causes).</p>
<p>As regards this theory of Epigenesis, no one has
contributed more either to its proof or to the establishment
of the legitimate principles of its application,—partly
by the limitation of a too presumptuous employment
of it,—than Herr Hofr. <i>Blumenbach</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_122" id="FNanchor_122">122</a> In
all physical explanations of these formations he
starts from organised matter. That crude matter
should have originally formed itself according to
mechanical laws, that life should have sprung from
the nature of what is lifeless, that matter should
have been able to dispose itself into the form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of a self-maintaining purposiveness—this he rightly
declares to be contradictory to Reason. But at the
same time he leaves to natural mechanism under
this to us indispensable <i>principle</i> of an original
<i>organisation</i>, an undeterminable but yet unmistakeable
element, in reference to which the faculty of
matter in an organised body is called by him a
<i>formative impulse</i> (in contrast to, and yet standing
under the higher guidance and direction of, that
merely mechanical <i>formative power</i> universally resident
in matter).</p>
<h5 id="s82">§ 82. <i>Of the teleological system in the external
relations of organised beings</i></h5>
<p>By external purposiveness I mean that by which
one thing of nature serves another as means to a
purpose. Now things which have no internal purposiveness
and which presuppose none for their
possibility, <i>e.g.</i> earth, air, water, etc., may at the same
time be very purposive externally, <i>i.e.</i> in relation to
other beings. But these latter must be organised
beings, <i>i.e.</i> natural purposes, for otherwise the former
could not be judged as means to them. Thus water,
air, and earth cannot be regarded as means to the
raising of mountains, because mountains contain
nothing in themselves that requires a ground of
their possibility according to purposes, in reference to
which therefore their cause can never be represented
under the predicate of a means (as useful therefor).</p>
<p>External purposiveness is a quite different concept
from that of internal purposiveness, which
is bound up with the possibility of an object irrespective
of its actuality being itself a purpose. We
can ask about an organised being the question:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
What is it for? But we cannot easily ask this
about things in which we recognise merely the
working of nature’s mechanism. For in the
former, as regards their internal possibility, we represent
a causality according to purposes, a creative
Understanding, and we refer this active faculty to
its determining ground, viz. design. There is only
one external purposiveness which is connected with
the internal purposiveness of organisation, and yet
serves in the external relation of a means to a
purpose, without the question necessarily arising, as
to what end this being so organised must have
existed for. This is the organisation of both sexes
in their mutual relation for the propagation of their
kind; since here we can always ask, as in the case
of an individual, why must such a pair exist? The
answer is: This pair first constitutes an <i>organising</i>
whole, though not an organised whole in a single
body.</p>
<p>If we now ask, wherefore anything is, the answer
is either: Its presence and its production have no
reference at all to a cause working according to
design, and so we always refer its origin to the
mechanism of nature, or: There is somewhere a designed
ground of its presence (as a contingent natural
being). This thought we can hardly separate from
the concept of an organised thing; for, since we
must place at the basis of its internal possibility a
causality of final causes and an Idea lying at the
ground of this, we cannot think the existence of this
product except as a purpose. For the represented
effect, the representation of which is at the same
time the determining ground of the intelligent cause
working towards its production, is called a <i>purpose</i>.
In this case therefore we can either say: The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
purpose of the existence of such a natural being
is in itself; <i>i.e.</i> it is not merely a purpose but a
<i>final purpose</i>, or: This is external to it in another
natural being, <i>i.e.</i> it exists purposively not as a
final purpose, but necessarily as a means.</p>
<p>But if we go through the whole of nature
we find in it, as nature, no being which could
make claim to the eminence of being the final
purpose of creation; and we can even prove <i>a priori</i>
that what might be for nature an <i>ultimate purpose</i>,
according to all the thinkable determinations and
properties wherewith one could endow it, could yet
as a natural thing never be a <i>final purpose</i>.</p>
<p>If we consider the vegetable kingdom we might
at first sight, on account of the immeasurable
fertility with which it spreads itself almost on every
soil, be led to take it for a mere product of that
mechanism which nature displays in the formations
of the mineral kingdom. But a more intimate
knowledge of its indescribably wise organisation
does not permit us to hold to this thought, but
prompts the question: What are these things
created for? If it is answered: For the animal
kingdom, which is thereby nourished and has thus
been able to spread over the earth in genera so
various, then the further question comes: What
are these plant-devouring animals for? The answer
would be something like this: For beasts of prey,
which can only be nourished by that which has life.
Finally we have the question: What are these last,
as well as the first-mentioned natural kingdoms,
good for? For man, in reference to the manifold
use which his Understanding teaches him to make
of all these creatures. He is the ultimate purpose
of creation here on earth, because he is the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
being upon it who can form a concept of purposes,
and who can by his Reason make out of an
aggregate of purposively formed things a system of
purposes.</p>
<p>We might also with the chevalier <i>Linnaeus</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_123" id="FNanchor_123">123</a> go
the apparently opposite way and say: The herbivorous
animals are there to moderate the luxurious
growth of the vegetable kingdom, by which many
of its species are choked. The carnivora are to set
bounds to the voracity of the herbivora. Finally
man, by his pursuit of these and his diminution
of their numbers, preserves a certain equilibrium
between the producing and the destructive powers
of nature. And so man, although in a certain
reference he might be esteemed a purpose, yet in
another has only the rank of a means.</p>
<p>If an objective purposiveness in the variety of
the genera of creatures and their external relations
to one another, as purposively constructed beings,
be made a principle, then it is conformable to Reason
to conceive in these relations a certain organisation
and a system of all natural kingdoms according
to final causes. Only here experience seems flatly
to contradict the maxims of Reason, especially as
concerns an ultimate purpose of nature, which is
indispensable for the possibility of such a system
and which we can put nowhere else but in man.
For regarding him as one of the many animal
genera, nature has not in the least excepted him
from its destructive or its productive powers, but
has subjected everything to a mechanism thereof
without any purpose.</p>
<p>The first thing that must be designedly prepared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
in an arrangement for a purposive complex of
natural beings on the earth would be their place
of habitation, the soil and the element on and in
which they are to thrive. But a more exact knowledge
of the constitution of this basis of all organic
production indicates no other causes than those
working quite undesignedly, causes which rather
destroy than favour production, order, and purposes.
Land and sea not only contain in themselves
memorials of ancient mighty desolations which have
confounded them and all creatures that are in them;
but their whole structure, the strata of the one
and the boundaries of the other, have quite the
appearance of being the product of the wild and
violent forces of a nature working in a state of chaos.
Although the figure, the structure, and the slope of
the land might seem to be purposively ordered
for the reception of water from the air, for the
welling up of streams between strata of different
kinds (for many kinds of products), and for the
course of rivers—yet a closer investigation shows
that they are merely the effects of volcanic eruptions
or of inundations of the ocean, as regards not only
the first production of this figure, but, above all, its
subsequent transformation, as well as the disappearance
of its first organic productions.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_124" id="FNanchor_124">124</a> Now if the
place of habitation of all these creatures, the soil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
(of the land) or the bosom (of the sea), indicates
nothing but a quite undesigned mechanism of its
production, how and with what right can we demand
and maintain a different origin for these latter
products? The closest examination, indeed (in
<i>Camper’s</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_125" id="FNanchor_125">125</a> judgement), of the remains of the aforesaid
devastations of nature seems to show that man was
not comprehended in these revolutions; but yet he
is so dependent on the remaining creatures that, if
a universally directing mechanism of nature be
admitted in the case of the others, he must also
be regarded as comprehended under it; even though
his Understanding (for the most part at least) has
been able to deliver him from these devastations.</p>
<p>But this argument seems to prove more than
was intended by it. It seems to prove not merely
that man cannot be the ultimate purpose of nature,
and that on the same grounds the aggregate of
the organised things of nature on the earth cannot
be a system of purposes; but also that the natural
products formerly held to be natural purposes have
no other origin than the mechanism of nature.</p>
<p>But in the solution given above of the Antinomy
of the principles of the mechanical and teleological
methods of production of organic beings of nature,
we have seen that they are merely principles of
the reflective Judgement in respect of nature as it
produces forms in accordance with particular laws
(for the systematic connexion of which we have no
key). They do not determine the origin of these
beings in themselves; but only say that we, by the
constitution of our Understanding and our Reason,
cannot conceive it in this kind of being except
according to final causes. The greatest possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
effort, even audacity, in the attempt to explain
them mechanically is not only permitted, but we
are invited to it by Reason; notwithstanding that
we know from the subjective grounds of the particular
species and limitations of our Understanding (not
<i>e.g.</i> because the mechanism of production would
contradict in itself an origin according to purposes)
that we can never attain thereto. Finally, the
compatibility of both ways of representing the
possibility of nature may lie in the supersensible
principle of nature (external to us, as well as in
us); whilst the method of representation according
to final causes may be only a subjective condition
of the use of our Reason, when it not merely wishes
to form a judgement upon objects as phenomena,
but desires to refer these phenomena together with
their principles to their supersensible substrate, in
order to find certain laws of their unity possible,
which it cannot represent to itself except through
purposes (of which the Reason also has such as
are supersensible).</p>
<h5 id="s83">§ 83. <i>Of the ultimate purpose of nature as a
teleological system</i></h5>
<p>We have shown in the preceding that, though
not for the determinant but for the reflective
Judgement, we have sufficient cause for judging
man to be, not merely like all organised beings
a <i>natural purpose</i>, but also the <i>ultimate purpose</i> of
nature here on earth; in reference to whom all
other natural things constitute a system of purposes
according to fundamental propositions of Reason.
If now that must be found in man himself, which
is to be furthered as a purpose by means of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
connexion with nature, this purpose must either
be of a kind that can be satisfied by nature in
its beneficence; or it is the aptitude and skill for
all kinds of purposes for which nature (external
and internal) can be used by him. The first
purpose of nature would be man’s <i>happiness</i>, the
second his <i>culture</i>.</p>
<p>The concept of happiness is not one that
man derives by abstraction from his instincts and
so deduces from his animal nature; but it is a
mere <i>Idea</i> of a state, that he wishes to make
adequate to the Idea under merely empirical
conditions (which is impossible). This Idea he
projects in such different ways on account of the
complication of his Understanding with Imagination
and Sense, and changes so often, that nature, even
if it were entirely subjected to his elective will,
could receive absolutely no determinate, universal
and fixed law, so as to harmonise with this vacillating
concept and thus with the purpose which each
man arbitrarily sets before himself. And even if
we reduce this to the true natural wants as to
which our race is thoroughly agreed, or on the
other hand, raise ever so high man’s skill to
accomplish his imagined purposes; yet, even thus,
what man understands by happiness, and what is
in fact his proper, ultimate, natural purpose (not
purpose of freedom), would never be attained by
him. For it is not his nature to rest and be
contented with the possession and enjoyment of
anything whatever. On the other side, too, there
is something wanting. Nature has not taken him
for her special darling and favoured him with
benefit above all animals. Rather, in her destructive
operations,—plague, hunger, perils of waters, frost,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
assaults of other animals great and small, etc.,—in
these things has she spared him as little as any
other animal. Further, the inconsistency of his
own <i>natural dispositions</i> drives him into self-devised
torments, and also reduces others of his own race to
misery, by the oppression of lordship, the barbarism
of war, and so forth; he, himself, as far as in him
lies, works for the destruction of his own race; so
that even with the most beneficent external nature,
its purpose, if it were directed to the happiness
of our species, would not be attained in an earthly
system, because our nature is not susceptible of it.
Man is then always only a link in the chain of
natural purposes; a principle certainly in respect
of many purposes, for which nature seems to have
destined him in her disposition, and towards which he
sets himself, but also a means for the maintenance
of purposiveness in the mechanism of the remaining
links. As the only being on earth which has an
Understanding and, consequently, a faculty of setting
arbitrary purposes before itself, he is certainly entitled
to be the lord of nature; and if it be regarded
as a teleological system he is, by his destination, the
ultimate purpose of nature. But this is subject to
the condition of his having an Understanding and
the Will to give to it and to himself such a reference
to purposes, as can be self-sufficient independently
of nature, and, consequently, can be a final purpose;
which, however, must not be sought in nature itself.</p>
<p>But in order to find out where in man we have
to place that <i>ultimate purpose</i> of nature, we must
seek out what nature can supply to prepare him
for what he must do himself in order to be a final
purpose, and we must separate it from all those
purposes whose possibility depends upon things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
that one can expect only from nature. Of the
latter kind is earthly happiness, by which is understood
the complex of all man’s purposes possible
through nature, whether external nature or man’s
nature; <i>i.e.</i> the matter of all his earthly purposes,
which, if he makes it his whole purpose, renders
him incapable of positing his own existence as a
final purpose, and being in harmony therewith.
There remains therefore of all his purposes in
nature only the formal subjective condition; viz.
the aptitude of setting purposes in general before
himself, and (independent of nature in his purposive
determination) of using nature, conformably to the
maxims of his free purposes in general, as a means.
This nature can do in regard to the final purpose
that lies outside it, and it therefore may be regarded
as its ultimate purpose. The production of the
aptitude of a rational being for arbitrary purposes
in general (consequently in his freedom) is <i>culture</i>.
Therefore, culture alone can be the ultimate purpose
which we have cause for ascribing to nature in
respect to the human race (not man’s earthly happiness
or the fact that he is the chief instrument
of instituting order and harmony in irrational nature
external to himself).</p>
<p>But all culture is not adequate to this ultimate
purpose of nature. The culture of <i>skill</i> is indeed the
chief subjective condition of aptitude for furthering
one’s purposes in general; but it is not adequate to
furthering the <i>will</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_126" id="FNanchor_126">126</a> in the determination and choice
of purposes, which yet essentially belongs to the
whole extent of an aptitude for purposes. The
latter condition of aptitude, which we might call
the culture of training (discipline), is negative, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
consists in the freeing of the will from the despotism
of desires. By these, tied as we are to certain
natural things, we are rendered incapable even of
choosing, while we allow those impulses to serve as
fetters, which Nature has given us as guiding
threads that we should not neglect or violate the
destination of our animal nature—we being all the
time free enough to strain or relax, to extend
or diminish them, according as the purposes of
Reason require.</p>
<p>Skill cannot be developed in the human race
except by means of inequality among men; for the
great majority provide the necessities of life, as it
were, mechanically, without requiring any art in
particular, for the convenience and leisure of others
who work at the less necessary elements of culture,
science and art. In an oppressed condition they
have hard work and little enjoyment, although
much of the culture of the higher classes gradually
spreads to them. Yet with the progress of this
culture (the height of which is called luxury, reached
when the propensity to what can be done without
begins to be injurious to what is indispensable),
their calamities increase equally in two directions,
on the one hand through violence from without, on
the other hand through internal discontent; but
still this splendid misery is bound up with the
development of the natural capacities of the human
race, and the purpose of nature itself, although not
our purpose, is thus attained. The formal condition
under which nature can alone attain this its final
design, is that arrangement of men’s relations to one
another, by which lawful authority in a whole, which
we call a <i>civil community</i>, is opposed to the abuse
of their conflicting freedoms; only in this can the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
greatest development of natural capacities take
place. For this also there would be requisite,—if
men were clever enough to find it out and wise
enough to submit themselves voluntarily to its
constraint,—a <i>cosmopolitan</i> whole, <i>i.e.</i> a system of
all states that are in danger of acting injuriously
upon each other.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_127" id="FNanchor_127">127</a> Failing this, and with the
obstacles which ambition, lust of dominion, and
avarice, especially in those who have the authority
in their hands, oppose even to the possibility of
such a scheme, there is, inevitably, <i>war</i> (by
which sometimes states subdivide and resolve
themselves into smaller states, sometimes a state
annexes other smaller states and strives to form a
greater whole). Though war is an undesigned
enterprise of men (stirred up by their unbridled
passions), yet is it [perhaps]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_128" id="FNanchor_128">128</a> a deep-hidden and
designed enterprise of supreme wisdom for preparing,
if not for establishing, conformity to law
amid the freedom of states, and with this a unity
of a morally grounded system of those states. In
spite of the dreadful afflictions with which it visits
the human race, and the perhaps greater afflictions
with which the constant preparation for it in time
of peace oppresses them, yet is it (although the
hope for a restful state of popular happiness is ever
further off) a motive for developing all talents serviceable
for culture, to the highest possible pitch.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_129" id="FNanchor_129">129</a></p>
<p>As concerns the discipline of the inclinations,—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>for
which our natural capacity in regard of our
destination as an animal race is quite purposive, but
which render the development of humanity very
difficult,—there is manifest in respect of this second
requirement for culture a purposive striving of
nature to a cultivation which makes us receptive of
higher purposes than nature itself can supply. We
cannot strive against the preponderance of evil,
which is poured out upon us by the refinement of
taste pushed to idealisation, and even by the luxury
of science as affording food for pride, through the
insatiable number of inclinations thus aroused. But
yet we cannot mistake the purpose of nature—ever
aiming to win us away from the rudeness and violence
of those inclinations (inclinations to enjoyment)
which belong rather to our animality, and for the
most part are opposed to the cultivation of our higher
destiny, and to make way for the development of
our humanity. The beautiful arts and the sciences
which, by their universally-communicable pleasure,
and by the polish and refinement of society, make
man more civilised, if not morally better, win us in
large measure from the tyranny of sense-propensions,
and thus prepare men for a lordship, in which
Reason alone shall have authority; whilst the evils
with which we are visited, partly by nature, partly
by the intolerant selfishness of men, summon,
strengthen, and harden the powers of the soul not
to submit to them, and so make us feel an
aptitude for higher purposes, which lies hidden
in us.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_130" id="FNanchor_130">130</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s84">§ 84. <i>Of the final purpose of the existence of a
world, i.e. of creation itself</i></h5>
<p>A <i>final purpose</i> is that purpose which needs no
other as condition of its possibility.</p>
<p>If the mere mechanism of nature be assumed as
the ground of explanation of its purposiveness, we
cannot ask: what are things in the world there for?
For according to such an idealistic system it is only
the physical possibility of things (to think which as
purposes would be mere subtlety without any Object)
that is under discussion; whether we refer this form
of things to chance or to blind necessity, in either
case the question would be vain. If, however, we
assume the purposive combination in the world to
be real and to be [brought about] by a particular kind
of causality, viz. that of a <i>designedly-working</i> cause,
we cannot stop at the question: why have things
of the world (organised beings) this or that form?
why are they placed by nature in this or that relation
to one another? But once an Understanding
is thought that must be regarded as the cause of
the possibility of such forms as are actually
found in things, it must be also asked on objective
grounds: Who could have determined this productive
Understanding to an operation of this kind?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
This being is then the final purpose in reference to
which such things are there.</p>
<p>I have said above that the final purpose is not a
purpose which nature would be competent to bring
about and to produce in conformity with its Idea,
because it is unconditioned. For there is nothing
in nature (regarded as a sensible being) for which
the determining ground present in itself would not
be always conditioned; and this holds not merely
of external (material) nature, but also of internal
(thinking) nature—it being of course understood
that I only am considering that in myself which is
nature. But a thing that is to exist necessarily,
on account of its objective constitution, as the final
purpose of an intelligent cause, must be of the kind
that in the order of purposes it is dependent on no
further condition than merely its Idea.</p>
<p>Now we have in the world only one kind of
beings whose causality is teleological, <i>i.e.</i> is directed
to purposes and is at the same time so constituted
that the law according to which they have to determine
purposes for themselves is represented as
unconditioned and independent of natural conditions,
and yet as in itself necessary. The being of this
kind is man, but man considered as noumenon; the
only natural being in which we can recognise, on the
side of its peculiar constitution, a supersensible
faculty (<i>freedom</i>) and also the law of causality,
together with its Object, which this faculty may
propose to itself as highest purpose (the highest
good in the world).</p>
<p>Now of man (and so of every rational creature
in the World) as a moral being it can no longer
be asked: why (<i>quem in finem</i>) he exists? His
existence involves the highest purpose to which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
as far as is in his power, he can subject the
whole of nature; contrary to which at least he
cannot regard himself as subject to any influence
of nature.—If now things of the world, as beings
dependent in their existence, need a supreme cause
acting according to purposes, man is the final purpose
of creation; since without him the chain of
mutually subordinated purposes would not be complete
as regards its ground. Only in man, and
only in him as subject of morality, do we meet
with unconditioned legislation in respect of purposes,
which therefore alone renders him capable of being
a final purpose, to which the whole of nature is
teleologically subordinated.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_131" id="FNanchor_131">131</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s85">§ 85. <i>Of Physico-theology</i></h5>
<p><i>Physico-theology</i> is the endeavour of Reason to
infer the Supreme Cause of nature and its properties
from the <i>purposes</i> of nature (which can only be empirically
known). <i>Moral theology</i> (ethico-theology)
would be the endeavour to infer that Cause and its
properties from the moral purpose of rational beings
in nature (which can be known <i>a priori</i>).</p>
<p>The former naturally precedes the latter. For if
we wish to infer a World Cause <i>teleologically</i> from
the things in the world, purposes of nature must
first be given, for which we afterwards have to seek
a final purpose, and for this the principle of the
causality of this Supreme Cause.</p>
<p>Many investigations of nature can and must be
conducted according to the teleological principle,
without our having cause to inquire into the ground
of the possibility of purposive working with which
we meet in various products of nature. But if we
wish to have a concept of this we have absolutely
no further insight into it than the maxim of the
reflective Judgement affords: viz. if only a single
organic product of nature were given to us, by the
constitution of our cognitive faculty we could think
no other ground for it than that of a cause of nature
itself (whether the whole of nature or only this bit
of it) which contains the causality for it through
Understanding. This principle of judging, though
it does not bring us any further in the explanation of
natural things and their origin, yet discloses to us an
outlook over nature, by which perhaps we may be
able to determine more closely the concept, otherwise
so unfruitful, of an Original Being.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Now I say that Physico-theology, however far it
may be pursued, can disclose to us nothing of a <i>final
purpose</i> of creation; for it does not even extend to
the question as to this. It can, it is true, justify the
concept of an intelligent World Cause, as a subjective
concept (only available for the constitution of
our cognitive faculty) of the possibility of things
that we can make intelligible to ourselves according
to purposes; but it cannot determine this concept
further, either in a theoretical or a practical point of
view. Its endeavour does not come up to its design
of being the basis of a Theology, but it always
remains only a physical Teleology; because the
purposive reference therein is and must be always
considered only as conditioned in nature, and it
consequently cannot inquire into the purpose for
which nature itself exists (for which the ground must
be sought outside nature),—notwithstanding that it
is upon the determinate Idea of this that the determinate
concept of that Supreme Intelligent World
Cause, and the consequent possibility of a Theology,
depend.</p>
<p>What the things in the world are mutually
useful for; what good the manifold in a thing does
for the thing; how we have ground to assume that
nothing in the world is in vain, but that everything
<i>in nature</i> is good for something,—the condition being
granted that certain things are to exist (as purposes),
whence our Reason has in its power for the Judgement
no other principle of the possibility of the
Object, which it inevitably judges teleologically,
than that of subordinating the mechanism of nature
to the Architectonic of an intelligent Author of the
world—all this the teleological consideration of the
world supplies us with excellently and to our extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
admiration. But because the data, and so the
principles, for <i>determining</i> that concept of an intelligent
World Cause (as highest artist) are merely
empirical, they do not enable us to infer any
of its properties beyond those which experience
reveals in its effects. Now experience, since it
can never embrace collective nature as a system,
must often (apparently) happen upon this concept
(and by mutually conflicting grounds of proof); but
it can never, even if we had the power of surveying
empirically the whole system as far as it concerns
mere nature, raise us above nature to the purpose of
its existence, and so to the determinate concept of
that supreme Intelligence.</p>
<p>If we lessen the problem with the solution of
which Physico-theology has to do, its solution appears
easy. If we reduce the concept of a <i>Deity</i> to that
of an intelligent being thought by us, of which there
may be one or more, which possesses many and very
great properties, but not all the properties which are
requisite for the foundation of a nature in harmony
with the greatest possible purpose; or if we do not
scruple in a theory to supply by arbitrary additions
what is deficient in the grounds of proof, and so,
where we have only ground for assuming <i>much</i>
perfection (and what is “much” for us?), consider
ourselves entitled to presuppose <i>all possible</i> perfection;
thus indeed physical Teleology may make
weighty claims to the distinction of being the basis
of a Theology. But if we are desired to point out
what impels and moreover authorises us to add these
supplements, then we shall seek in vain for a ground
of justification in the principles of the theoretical
use of Reason, which is ever desirous in the explanation
of an Object of experience to ascribe to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
it no more properties than those for which empirical
data of possibility are to be found. On closer examination
we should see that properly speaking an Idea
of a Supreme Being, which rests on a quite different
use of Reason (the practical use), lies in us fundamentally
<i>a priori</i>, impelling us to supplement, by the
concept of a Deity, the defective representation,
supplied by a physical Teleology, of the original
ground of the purposes in nature; and we should
not falsely imagine that we had worked out this
Idea, and with it a Theology by means of the
theoretical use of Reason in the physical cognition
of the world—much less that we had proved its
reality.</p>
<p>One cannot blame the ancients much, if they
thought of their gods as differing much from each
other both as regards their faculties and as regards
their designs and volitions, but yet thought of all
of them, the Supreme One not excepted, as always
limited after human fashion. For if they considered
the arrangement and the course of things in nature,
they certainly found ground enough for assuming
something more than mechanism as its cause, and
for conjecturing behind the machinery of this world
designs of certain higher causes, which they could
not think otherwise than superhuman. But because
they met with good and evil, the purposive and
the unpurposive, mingled together (at least as far
as our insight goes), and could not permit themselves
to assume nevertheless that wise and benevolent
purposes of which they saw no proof lay hidden
at bottom, on behalf of the arbitrary Idea of a
supremely perfect original Author, their judgement
upon the supreme World Cause could hardly have
been other than it was, so long as they proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
consistently according to maxims of the mere
theoretical use of Reason. Others, who wished
to be theologians as well as physicists, thought to
find contentment for the Reason by providing for
the absolute unity of the principle of natural things
which Reason demands, the Idea of a Being of
which as sole Substance the things would be
all only inherent determinations. This Substance
would not be Cause of the World by means of
intelligence, but in it all the intelligences of the
beings in the world would be comprised. This
Being consequently would produce nothing according
to purposes; but in it all things, on account
of the unity of the subject of which they are mere
determinations, must necessarily relate themselves
purposively to one another, though without purpose
and design. Thus they introduced the Idealism of
final causes, by changing the unity (so difficult to
explain) of a number of purposively combined
substances, from being the unity of causal dependence
<i>on one</i> Substance to be the unity of inherence
<i>in one</i>. This system—which in the sequel, considered
on the side of the inherent world beings,
becomes <i>Pantheism</i>, and (later) on the side of the
Subject subsisting by itself as Original Being,
becomes <i>Spinozism</i>,—does not so much resolve as
explain away into nothing the question of the first
ground of the purposiveness of nature; because this
latter concept, bereft of all reality, must be taken
for a mere misinterpretation of a universal ontological
concept of a thing in general.</p>
<p>Hence the concept of a Deity, which would
be adequate for our teleological judging of nature,
can never be derived from mere theoretical
principles of the use of Reason (on which Physico-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>theology
alone is based). For as one alternative
we may explain all Teleology as a mere deception
of the Judgement in its judging of the causal combination
of things, and fly to the sole principle of a
mere mechanism of nature, which merely seems to
us, on account of the unity of the Substance of
whose determinations nature is but the manifold,
to contain a universal reference to purposes. Or
if, instead of this Idealism of final causes, we
wish to remain attached to the principle of the
Realism of this particular kind of causality, we
may set beneath natural purposes many intelligent
original beings or only a single one. But so far
as we have for the basis of this concept [of Realism]
only empirical principles derived from the actual
purposive combination in the world, we cannot on
the one hand find any remedy for the discordance
that nature presents in many examples in respect
of unity of purpose; and on the other hand, as to
the concept of a single intelligent Cause, so far as
we are authorised by mere experience, we can
never draw it therefrom in a manner sufficiently
determined for any serviceable Theology whatever
(whether theoretical or practical).</p>
<p>Physical Teleology impels us, it is true, to seek
a Theology; but it cannot produce one, however
far we may investigate nature by means of experience
and, in reference to the purposive combination
apparent in it, call in Ideas of Reason (which must
be theoretical for physical problems). What is the
use, one might well complain, of placing at the basis
of all these arrangements a great Understanding
incommensurable by us, and supposing it to govern
the world according to design, if nature does not and
cannot tell us anything of the final design? For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>
without this we cannot refer all these natural purposes
to any common point, nor can we form any
teleological principle, sufficient either for cognising
the purposes collected in a system, or for forming
a concept of the Supreme Understanding, as Cause
of such a nature, that could serve as a standard
for our Judgement reflecting teleologically thereon.
I should thus have an <i>artistic Understanding</i> for
scattered purposes, but no <i>Wisdom</i> for a final purpose,
in which final purpose nevertheless must be
contained the determining ground of the said Understanding.
But in the absence of a final purpose
which pure Reason alone can supply (because all
purposes in the world are empirically conditioned,
and can contain nothing absolutely good but only
what is good for this or that regarded as a contingent
design), and which alone would teach me
what properties, what degree, and what relation of
the Supreme Cause to nature I have to think in
order to judge of nature as a teleological system;
how and with what right do I dare to extend at
pleasure my very limited concept of that original
Understanding (which I can base on my limited
knowledge of the world), of the Might of that
original Being in actualising its Ideas, and of its
Will to do so, and complete this into the Idea of
an Allwise, Infinite Being? If this is to be done
theoretically, it would presuppose omniscience in
me, in order to see into the purposes of nature in
their whole connexion, and in addition the power
of conceiving all possible plans, in comparison with
which the present plan would be judged on [sufficient]
grounds as the best. For without this complete
knowledge of the effect I can arrive at no determinate
concept of the Supreme Cause, which can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
only be found in the concept of an Intelligence
infinite in every respect, <i>i.e.</i> the concept of a Deity,
and so I can supply no foundation for Theology.</p>
<p>Hence, with every possible extension of physical
Teleology, according to the propositions above laid
down we may say: By the constitution and the
principles of our cognitive faculty we can think of
nature, in its purposive arrangements which have
become known to us, in no other way than as the
product of an Understanding to which it is subject.
But the theoretical investigation of nature can never
reveal to us whether this Understanding may not
also, with the whole of nature and its production,
have had a final design (which would not lie in the
nature of the sensible world). On the contrary,
with all our knowledge of nature it remains undecided
whether that Supreme Cause is its original
ground according to a final purpose, or not rather
by means of an Understanding determined by the
mere necessity of its nature to produce certain forms
(according to the analogy of what we call the art-instinct
in animals); without it being necessary to
ascribe to it even wisdom, much less the highest
wisdom combined with all other properties requisite
for the perfection of its product.</p>
<p>Hence Physico-theology is a misunderstood
physical Teleology, only serviceable as a preparation
(propaedeutic) for Theology; and it is only
adequate to this design by the aid of a foreign
principle on which it can rely, and not in itself,
as its name would intimate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s86">§ 86. <i>Of Ethico-theology</i></h5>
<p>The commonest Understanding, if it thinks over
the presence of things in the world, and the existence
of the world itself, cannot forbear from the judgement
that all the various creatures, no matter how great
the art displayed in their arrangement, and how
various their purposive mutual connexion,—even
the complex of their numerous systems (which we
incorrectly call worlds),—would be for nothing, if
there were not also men (rational beings in general).
Without men the whole creation would be a mere
waste, in vain, and without final purpose. But
it is not in reference to man’s cognitive faculty
(theoretical Reason) that the being of everything
else in the world gets its worth; he is not there
merely that there may be some one to <i>contemplate</i>
the world. For if the contemplation of the world
only afforded a representation of things without
any final purpose, no worth could accrue to its
being from the mere fact that it is known; we
must presuppose for it a final purpose, in reference
to which its contemplation itself has worth. Again
it is not in reference to the feeling of pleasure, or
to the sum of pleasures, that we think a final purpose
of creation as given; <i>i.e.</i> we do not estimate that
absolute worth by well-being or by enjoyment
(whether bodily or mental), or in a word, by happiness.
For the fact that man, if he exists, takes
this for his final design, gives us no concept as to
why in general he should exist, and as to what
worth he has in himself to make his existence
pleasant. He must, therefore, be supposed to be
the final purpose of creation, in order to have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>
rational ground for holding that nature must
harmonise with his happiness, if it is considered
as an absolute whole according to principles of
purposes.—Hence there remains only the
faculty of desire; not, however, that which makes
man dependent (through sensuous impulses) upon
nature, nor that in respect of which the worth
of his being depends upon what he receives and
enjoys. But the worth which he alone can give
to himself, and which consists in what he does,
how and according to what principles he acts,
and that not as a link in nature’s chain but in the
<i>freedom</i> of his faculty of desire—<i>i.e.</i> a good will—is
that whereby alone his being can have an absolute
worth, and in reference to which the being of the
world can have a <i>final purpose</i>.</p>
<p>The commonest judgement of healthy human
Reason completely accords with this, that it is
only as a moral being that man can be a final
purpose of creation; if we but direct men’s attention
to the question and incite them to investigate it.
What does it avail, one will say, that this man
has so much talent, that he is so active therewith,
and that he exerts thereby a useful influence over
the community, thus having a great worth both
in relation to his own happy condition and to the
benefit of others, if he does not possess a good
will? He is a contemptible Object considered in
respect of his inner self; and if the creation is
not to be without any final purpose at all, he, who
as man belongs to it, must, in a world under moral
laws, inasmuch as he is a bad man, forfeit his subjective
purpose (happiness). This is the only
condition under which his existence can accord with
the final purpose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>
If now we meet with purposive arrangements
in the world and, as Reason inevitably requires,
subordinate the purposes that are only conditioned
to an unconditioned, supreme, <i>i.e.</i> final, purpose;
then we easily see in the first place that we are
thus concerned not with a purpose of nature
(internal to itself), so far as it exists, but with
the purpose of its existence along with all its
ordinances, and, consequently, with the ultimate
<i>purpose of creation</i>, and specially with the supreme
condition under which can be posited a final purpose
(<i>i.e.</i> the ground which determines a supreme Understanding
to produce the beings of the world).</p>
<p>Since now it is only as a moral being that
we recognise man as the purpose of creation, we
have in the first place a ground (at least, the
chief condition) for regarding the world as a
whole connected according to purposes, and as
a <i>system</i> of final causes. And, more especially, as
regards the reference (necessary for us by the
constitution of our Reason) of natural purposes to
an intelligent World Cause, we have <i>one principle</i>
enabling us to think the nature and properties of
this First Cause as supreme ground in the kingdom
of purposes, and to determine its concept. This
physical Teleology could not do; it could only
lead to indeterminate concepts thereof, unserviceable
alike in theoretical and in practical use.</p>
<p>From the principle, thus determined, of the
causality of the Original Being we must not think
Him merely as Intelligence and as legislative for
nature, but also as legislating supremely in a moral
kingdom of purposes. In reference to the <i>highest
good</i>, alone possible under His sovereignty, viz. the
existence of rational beings under moral laws, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
shall think this Original Being as <i>all-knowing</i>: thus
our inmost dispositions (which constitute the proper
moral worth of the actions of rational beings of the
world) will not be hid from Him. We shall think
Him as <i>all-mighty</i>: thus He will be able to make
the whole of nature accord with this highest
purpose. We shall think Him as <i>all-good</i>, and at
the same time as <i>just</i>: because these two properties
(which when united constitute <i>Wisdom</i>) are the
conditions of the causality of a supreme Cause of
the world, as highest good, under moral laws. So
also all the other transcendental properties, such
as <i>Eternity</i>, <i>Omnipresence</i>, etc. [for goodness and
justice are moral properties<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_132" id="FNanchor_132">132</a>], which are presupposed
in reference to such a final purpose, must be thought
in Him.—In this way <i>moral Teleology</i> supplies the
deficiency in <i>physical Teleology</i>, and first establishes
a <i>Theology</i>; because the latter, if it did not borrow
from the former without being observed, but were
to proceed consistently, could only found a <i>Demonology</i>,
which is incapable of any definite concept.</p>
<p>But the principle of the reference of the world
to a supreme Cause, as Deity, on account of the
moral purposive destination of certain beings in
it, does not accomplish this by completing the
physico-teleological ground of proof and so taking
this necessarily as its basis. It is sufficient <i>in itself</i>
and directs attention to the purposes of nature and
the investigation of that incomprehensible great art
lying hidden behind its forms, in order to confirm
incidentally by means of natural purposes the Ideas
that pure practical Reason furnishes. For the
concept of beings of the world under moral laws
is a principle (<i>a priori</i>) according to which man must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span>
of necessity judge himself. Further, if there is
in general a World Cause acting designedly and
directed towards a purpose, this moral relation must
be just as necessarily the condition of the possibility
of a creation, as that in accordance with physical
laws (if, that is, this intelligent Cause has also a
final purpose). This is regarded <i>a priori</i> by
Reason as a necessary fundamental proposition for
it in its teleological judging of the existence of
things. It now only comes to this, whether we
have sufficient ground for Reason (either speculative
or practical) to ascribe to the supreme Cause,
acting in accordance with purposes, a <i>final purpose</i>.
For it may <i>a priori</i> be taken by us as certain
that this, by the subjective constitution of our
Reason and even of the Reason of other beings
as far as we can think it, can be nothing else than
<i>man under moral laws</i>: since otherwise the purposes
of nature in the physical order could not be
known <i>a priori</i>, especially as it can in no way
be seen that nature could not exist without such
purposes.</p>
<h6><i>Remark</i></h6>
<p>Suppose the case of a man at the moment when
his mind is disposed to a moral sensation. If surrounded
by the beauties of nature, he is in a state of
restful, serene enjoyment of his being, he feels a
want, viz. to be grateful for this to some being or
other. Or if another time he finds himself in the
same state of mind when pressed by duties that
he can and will only adequately discharge by a
voluntary sacrifice, he again feels in himself a want,
viz. to have thus executed a command and obeyed
a Supreme Lord. Or, again; if he has in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
heedless way transgressed his duty, but without
becoming answerable to men, his severe self-reproach
will speak to him with the voice of a judge
to whom he has to give account. In a word, he
needs a moral Intelligence, in order to have a Being
for the purpose of his existence, which may be,
conformably to this purpose, the cause of himself
and of the world. It is vain to assign motives
behind these feelings, for they are immediately
connected with the purest moral sentiment, because
<i>gratitude</i>, <i>obedience</i>, and <i>humiliation</i> (submission to
deserved chastisement) are mental dispositions that
make for duty; and the mind which is inclined
towards a widening of its moral sentiment here only
voluntarily conceives an object that is not in the
world in order where possible to render its duty
before such an one. It is therefore at least possible
and grounded too in our moral disposition to represent
a pure moral need of the existence of a Being,
by which our morality gains strength or even (at
least according to our representation) more scope,
viz. a new object for its exercise. That is, [there is
a need] to assume a morally-legislating Being outside
the world, without any reference to theoretical
proofs, still less to self-interest, from pure moral
grounds free from all foreign influence (and consequently
only subjective), on the mere recommendation
of a pure practical Reason legislating by itself
alone. And although such a mental disposition
might seldom occur or might not last long, but be
transient and without permanent effect, or might
even pass away without any meditation on the object
represented in such shadowy outline, or without care
to bring it under clear concepts—there is yet here
unmistakably the ground why our moral capacity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
as a subjective principle, should not be contented in
its contemplation of the world with its purposiveness
by means of natural causes, but should ascribe to
it a supreme Cause governing nature according to
moral principles.—In addition, we feel ourselves
constrained by the moral law to strive for a universal
highest purpose which yet we, in common
with the rest of nature, are incapable of attaining;
and it is only so far as we strive for it that we can
judge ourselves to be in harmony with the final
purpose of an intelligent World Cause (if such there
be). Thus is found a pure moral ground of practical
Reason for assuming this Cause (since it can be
done without contradiction), in order that we may
no more regard that effort of Reason as quite idle,
and so run the risk of abandoning it from weariness.</p>
<p>With all this, so much only is to be said, that
though <i>fear</i> first produces <i>gods</i> (demons), it is
<i>Reason</i> by means of its moral principles that can
first produce the concept of <i>God</i> (even when, as
commonly is the case, one is unskilled in the
Teleology of nature, or is very doubtful on account of
the difficulty of adjusting by a sufficiently established
principle its mutually contradictory phenomena).
Also, the inner <i>moral</i> purposive destination of man’s
being supplies that in which natural knowledge is
deficient, by directing us to think, for the final
purpose of the being of all things (for which no
other principle than an <i>ethical</i> one is satisfactory to
Reason), the supreme Cause [as endowed] with
properties, whereby it is able to subject the whole
of nature to that single design (for which nature is
merely the instrument),—<i>i.e.</i> to think it as a <i>Deity</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span></p>
<h5 id="s87">§ 87. <i>Of the moral proof of the Being of God</i></h5>
<p>There is a <i>physical Teleology</i>, which gives
sufficient ground of proof to our theoretical reflective
Judgement to assume the being of an
intelligent World-Cause. But we find also in ourselves
and still more in the concept of a rational
being in general endowed with freedom (of his
causality) a <i>moral Teleology</i>. However, as the
purposive reference, together with its law, is determined
<i>a priori</i> in ourselves and therefore can be
cognised as necessary, this internal conformity to
law requires no intelligent cause external to us;
any more than we need look to a highest Understanding
as the source of the purposiveness (for
every possible exercise of art) that we find in the
geometrical properties of figures. But this moral
Teleology concerns us as beings of the world, and
therefore as beings bound up with other things in
the world; upon which latter, whether as purposes
or as objects in respect of which we ourselves are
final purpose, the same moral laws require us to
pass judgement. This moral Teleology, then, has
to do with the reference of our own causality to
purposes and even to a final purpose that we must
aim at in the world, as well as with the reciprocal
reference of the world to that moral purpose, and
the external possibility of its accomplishment (to
which no physical Teleology can lead us). Hence
the question necessarily arises, whether it compels
our rational judgement to go beyond the world and
seek an intelligent supreme principle for that reference
of nature to the moral in us; in order to
represent nature as purposive even in reference to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>
our inner moral legislation and its possible accomplishment.
There is therefore certainly a moral
Teleology, which is connected on the one hand with
the <i>nomothetic</i> of freedom and on the other with that
of nature; just as necessarily as civil legislation is
connected with the question where the executive
authority is to be sought, and in general in every
case [with the question] wherein Reason is to
furnish a principle of the actuality of a certain
regular order of things only possible according to
Ideas.— We shall first set forth the progress of
Reason from that moral Teleology and its reference
to physical, to <i>Theology</i>; and then make some
observations upon the possibility and the validity of
this way of reasoning.</p>
<p>If we assume the being of certain things (or
even only certain forms of things) to be contingent
and so to be possible only through something else
which is their cause, we may seek for the unconditioned
ground of this causality of the supreme
(and so of the conditioned) either in the physical or
the teleological order (either according to the <i>nexus
effectivus</i> or the <i>nexus finalis</i>). That is, we may
either ask, what is the supreme productive cause of
these things; or what is their supreme (absolutely
unconditioned) purpose, <i>i.e.</i> the final purpose of that
cause in its production of this or all its products
generally? In the second case it is plainly presupposed
that this cause is capable of representing
purposes to itself, and consequently is an intelligent
Being; at least it must be thought as acting in
accordance with the laws of such a being.</p>
<p>If we follow the latter order, it is a <span class="smcap">Fundamental
Proposition</span> to which even the commonest
human Reason is compelled to give immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
assent, that if there is to be in general a <i>final purpose</i>
furnished <i>a priori</i> by Reason, this can be no
other than <i>man</i> (every rational being of the world)
<i>under moral laws</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_133" id="FNanchor_133">133</a> For (and so every one judges)
if the world consisted of mere lifeless, or even in
part of living but irrational, beings, its existence
would have no worth because in it there would be
no being who would have the least concept of
what worth is. Again, if there were intelligent
beings, whose Reason were only able to place the
worth of the existence of things in the relation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
nature to themselves (their well-being), but not to
furnish of itself an original worth (in freedom), then
there would certainly be (relative) purposes in the
world, but no (absolute) final purpose, because the
existence of such rational beings would be always
purposeless. But the moral laws have this peculiar
characteristic that they prescribe to Reason something
as a purpose without any condition, and
consequently exactly as the concept of a final purpose
requires. The existence of a Reason that can
be for itself the supreme law in the purposive reference,
in other words the existence of rational beings
under moral laws, can therefore alone be thought as
the final purpose of the being of a world. If on the
contrary this be not so, there would be either no
purpose at all in the cause of its being, or there
would be purposes, but no final purpose.</p>
<p>The moral law as the formal rational condition
of the use of our freedom obliges us by itself alone,
without depending on any purpose as material
condition; but it nevertheless determines for us,
and indeed <i>a priori</i>, a final purpose towards which
it obliges us to strive; and this purpose is the
<i>highest good in the world</i> possible through freedom.</p>
<p>The subjective condition under which man (and,
according to all our concepts, every rational finite
being) can set a final purpose before himself under
the above law is happiness. Consequently, the
highest physical good possible in the world, to be
furthered as a final purpose as far as in us lies, is
<i>happiness</i>, under the objective condition of the
harmony of man with the law of <i>morality</i> as worthiness
to be happy.</p>
<p>But it is impossible for us in accordance with
all our rational faculties to represent these two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>
requirements of the final purpose proposed to us
by the moral law, as <i>connected</i> by merely natural
causes, and yet as conformable to the Idea of that
final purpose. Hence the concept of the <i>practical
necessity</i> of such a purpose through the application
of our powers does not harmonise with the
theoretical concept of the <i>physical possibility</i> of
working it out, if we connect with our freedom no
other causality (as a means) than that of nature.</p>
<p>Consequently, we must assume a moral World-Cause
(an Author of the world), in order to set
before ourselves a final purpose consistently with
the moral law; and in so far as the latter is
necessary, so far (<i>i.e.</i> in the same degree and on the
same ground) the former also must be necessarily
assumed; <i>i.e.</i> we must admit that there is a God.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_134" id="FNanchor_134">134</a></p>
<p>This proof, to which we can easily give the form
of logical precision, does not say: it is as necessary
to assume the Being of God as to recognise the
validity of the moral law; and consequently he who
cannot convince himself of the first, can judge
himself free from the obligations of the second.
No! there must in such case only be given up the
<i>aiming at</i> the final purpose in the world, to be
brought about by the pursuit of the second (viz. a
happiness of rational beings in harmony with the
pursuit of moral laws, regarded as the highest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>
good). Every rational being would yet have to
cognise himself as straitly bound by the precepts
of morality, for its laws are formal and command
unconditionally without respect to purposes (as the
matter of volition). But the one requisite of the
final purpose, as practical Reason prescribes it to
beings of the world, is an irresistible purpose
imposed on them by their nature (as finite beings),
which Reason wishes to know as subject only to
the moral law as inviolable <i>condition</i>, or even as
universally set up in accordance with it. Thus
Reason takes for final purpose the furthering of
happiness in harmony with morality. To further
this so far as is in our power (<i>i.e.</i> in respect of
happiness) is commanded us by the moral law; be
the issue of this endeavour what it may. The
fulfilling of duty consists in the form of the earnest
will, not in the intermediate causes of success.</p>
<p>Suppose then that partly through the weakness
of all the speculative arguments so highly extolled,
and partly through many irregularities in nature and
the world of sense which come before him, a man
is persuaded of the proposition, There is no God;
he would nevertheless be contemptible in his own
eyes if on that account he were to imagine the
laws of duty as empty, invalid and inobligatory,
and wished to resolve to transgress them boldly.
Such an one, even if he could be convinced in the
sequel of that which he had doubted at the first,
would always be contemptible while having such a
disposition, although he should fulfil his duty as
regards its [external] effect as punctiliously as could
be desired, for [he would be acting] from fear or
from the aim at recompense, without the sentiment
of reverence for duty. If, conversely, as a believer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
[in God] he performs his duty according to his
conscience, uprightly and disinterestedly, and nevertheless
believes that he is free from all moral
obligation so soon as he is convinced that there
is no God, this could accord but badly with an
inner moral disposition.</p>
<p>We may then suppose the case of a righteous
man [<i>e.g. Spinoza</i>],<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_135" id="FNanchor_135">135</a> who holds himself firmly
persuaded that there is no God, and also (because
in respect of the Object of morality a similar
consequence results) no future life; how is he to
judge of his own inner purposive destination, by
means of the moral law, which he reveres in
practice? He desires no advantage to himself
from following it, either in this or another world;
he wishes, rather, disinterestedly to establish the
good to which that holy law directs all his powers.
But his effort is bounded; and from nature, although
he may expect here and there a contingent accordance,
he can never expect a regular harmony
agreeing according to constant rules (such as his
maxims are and must be, internally), with the purpose
that he yet feels himself obliged and impelled to
accomplish. Deceit, violence, and envy will always
surround him, although he himself be honest,
peaceable, and kindly; and the righteous men with
whom he meets will, notwithstanding all their
worthiness of happiness, be yet subjected by nature
which regards not this, to all the evils of want,
disease, and untimely death, just like the beasts of
the earth. So it will be until one wide grave
engulfs them together (honest or not, it makes no
difference), and throws them back—who were able
to believe themselves the final purpose of creation—into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
the abyss of the purposeless chaos of matter
from which they were drawn.— The purpose, then,
which this well-intentioned person had and ought to
have before him in his pursuit of moral laws, he
must certainly give up as impossible. Or else, if he
wishes to remain dependent upon the call of his
moral internal destination, and not to weaken the
respect with which the moral law immediately
inspires him, by assuming the nothingness of the
single, ideal, final purpose adequate to its high
demand (which cannot be brought about without
a violation of moral sentiment), he must, as he
well can—since there is at least no contradiction
from a practical point of view in forming a concept
of the possibility of a morally prescribed final purpose—assume
the being of a <i>moral</i> author of the
world, that is, a God.</p>
<h5 id="s88">§ 88. <i>Limitation of the validity of the moral proof</i></h5>
<p>Pure Reason, as a practical faculty, <i>i.e.</i> as
the faculty of determining the free use of our
causality by Ideas (pure rational concepts), not only
comprises in the moral law a regulative principle of
our actions, but supplies us at the same time with a
subjective constitutive principle in the concept of
an Object which Reason alone can think, and which
is to be actualised by our actions in the world
according to that law. The Idea of a final purpose
in the employment of freedom according to moral
laws has therefore subjective <i>practical</i> reality. We
are <i>a priori</i> determined by Reason to promote with
all our powers the <i>summum bonum</i> [Weltbeste]
which consists in the combination of the greatest
welfare of rational beings with the highest condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
of the good in itself, <i>i.e.</i> in universal happiness
conjoined with morality most accordant to law.
In this final purpose the possibility of one part,
happiness, is empirically conditioned, <i>i.e.</i> dependent
on the constitution of nature (which may or may
not agree with this purpose) and is in a theoretical
aspect problematical; whilst the other part, morality,
in respect of which we are free from the effects of
nature, stands fast <i>a priori</i> as to its possibility, and
is dogmatically certain. It is then requisite for the
objective theoretical reality of the concept of the
final purpose of rational beings, that we should not
only have <i>a priori</i> presupposed a final purpose for
ourselves, but also that the creation, <i>i.e.</i> the world
itself, should have as regards its existence a final
purpose, which if it could be proved <i>a priori</i> would
add objectivity to the subjective reality of the final
purpose [of rational beings]. For if the creation has
on the whole a final purpose, we cannot think it
otherwise than as harmonising with the moral purpose
(which alone makes the concept of a purpose
possible). Now we find without doubt purposes in
the world, and physical Teleology exhibits them in
such abundance, that if we judge in accordance with
Reason, we have ground for assuming as a principle
in the investigation of nature that nothing in nature
is without a purpose; but the final purpose of nature
we seek there in vain. This can and must therefore,
as its Idea only lies in Reason, be sought as regards
its objective possibility only in rational beings. And
the practical Reason of these latter not only supplies
this final purpose; it also determines this concept in
respect of the conditions under which alone a final
purpose of creation can be thought by us.</p>
<p>The question is now, whether the objective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
reality of the concept of a final purpose of creation
cannot be exhibited adequately to the theoretical
requirements of pure Reason—if not apodictically
for the determinant Judgement yet adequately for
the maxims of the theoretical reflective Judgement?
This is the least one could expect from theoretical
philosophy, which undertakes to combine the moral
purpose with natural purposes by means of the Idea
of one single purpose; but yet this little is far more
than it can accomplish.</p>
<p>According to the principle of the theoretical reflective
Judgement we should say: if we have ground
for assuming for the purposive products of nature a
supreme Cause of nature—whose causality in respect
of the actuality of creation is of a different kind from
that required for the mechanism of nature, <i>i.e.</i> must
be thought as the causality of an Understanding—we
have also sufficient ground for thinking in this
original Being not merely the purposes everywhere
in nature but also a final purpose. This is not
indeed a final purpose by which we can explain the
presence of such a Being, but one of which we
may at least convince ourselves (as was the case in
physical Teleology) that we can make the possibility
of such a world conceivable, not merely according to
purposes, but only through the fact that we ascribe
to its existence a final purpose.</p>
<p>But a final purpose is merely a concept of our
practical Reason, and can be inferred from no data
of experience for the theoretical judging of nature,
nor can it be applied to the cognition of nature.
No use of this concept is possible except its use for
practical Reason according to moral laws; and the
final purpose of creation is that constitution of the
world which harmonises with that which alone we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
can put forward definitely according to laws, viz. the
final purpose of our pure practical Reason, in so far
as it is to be practical.— Now we have in the moral
law, which enjoins on us in a practical point of view
the application of our powers to the accomplishment
of this final purpose, a ground for assuming its
possibility and practicability, and consequently too
(because without the concurrence of nature with
a condition not in our power, its accomplishment
would be impossible) a nature of things harmonious
with it. Hence we have a moral ground for thinking
in a world also a final purpose of creation.</p>
<p>We have not yet advanced from moral Teleology
to a Theology, <i>i.e.</i> to the being of a moral Author
of the world, but only to a final purpose of creation
which is determined in this way. But in order to
account for this creation, <i>i.e.</i> the existence of things,
in accordance with a <i>final purpose</i>, we must assume
not only first an intelligent Being (for the possibility
of things of nature which we are compelled to judge
of as <i>purposes</i>), but also a <i>moral</i> Being, as author of
the world, <i>i.e.</i> a <i>God</i>. This second conclusion is of
such a character that we see it holds merely for
the Judgement according to concepts of practical
Reason, and as such for the reflective and not the
determinant Judgement. It is true that in us morally
practical Reason is essentially different in its principles
from technically practical Reason. But we
cannot assume that it must be so likewise in the
supreme World-Cause, regarded as Intelligence,
and that a peculiar mode of its causality is requisite
for the final purpose, different from that which is
requisite merely for purposes of nature. We cannot
therefore assume that in our final purpose we have
not merely a <i>moral ground</i> for admitting a final<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>
purpose of creation (as an effect), but also for admitting
a <i>moral Being</i> as the original ground of creation.
But we may well say, that, <i>according to the constitution
of our rational faculty</i>, we cannot comprehend
the possibility of such a purposiveness <i>in respect of
the moral law</i>, and its Object, as there is in this final
purpose, apart from an Author and Governor of the
world, who is at the same time its moral Lawgiver.</p>
<p>The actuality of a highest morally-legislating
Author is therefore sufficiently established merely
<i>for the practical use</i> of our Reason, without determining
anything theoretically as regards its being.
For Reason requires, in respect of the possibility of
its purpose, which is given to us independently by
its own legislation, an Idea through which the
inability to follow up this purpose, according to
the mere natural concepts of the world, is removed
(sufficiently for the reflective Judgement). Thus
this Idea gains practical reality, although all means
of creating such for it in a theoretical point of view,
for the explanation of nature and determination of the
supreme Cause, are entirely wanting for speculative
cognition. For the theoretical reflective Judgement
physical Teleology sufficiently proves from the purposes
of nature an intelligent World-Cause; for the
practical Judgement moral Teleology establishes it
by the concept of a final purpose, which it is forced
to ascribe to creation in a practical point of view.
The objective reality of the Idea of God, as moral
Author of the world, cannot, it is true, be established
by physical purposes <i>alone</i>. But nevertheless, if the
cognition of these purposes is combined with that
of the moral purpose, they are, by virtue of the
maxim of pure Reason which bids us seek unity
of principles so far as is possible, of great importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>
for the practical reality of that Idea, by bringing
in the reality which it has for the Judgement in a
theoretical point of view.</p>
<p>To prevent a misunderstanding which may easily
arise, it is in the highest degree needful to remark
that, in the first place, we can <i>think</i> these properties
of the highest Being only according to analogy.
How indeed could we explore the nature of that,
to which experience can show us nothing similar?
Secondly, in this way we only think the supreme
Being; we cannot thereby <i>cognise</i> Him and ascribe
anything theoretically to Him. It would be needful
for the determinant Judgement in the speculative
aspect of our Reason, to consider what the supreme
World-Cause is in Himself. But here we are only
concerned with the question what concept we can
form of Him, according to the constitution of our
cognitive faculties; and whether we have to assume
His existence in order merely to furnish practical
reality to a purpose, which pure Reason without
any such presupposition enjoins upon us <i>a priori</i>
to bring about with all our powers, <i>i.e.</i> in order
to be able to think as possible a designed effect.
Although that concept may be transcendent for
the speculative Reason, and the properties which
we ascribe to the Being thereby thought may,
objectively used, conceal an anthropomorphism in
themselves; yet the design of its use is not to
determine the nature of that Being which is unattainable
by us, but to determine ourselves and our
will accordingly. We may call a cause after the
concept which we have of its effect (though only in
reference to this relation), without thereby meaning
to determine internally its inner constitution, by
means of the properties which can be made known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
to us solely by similar causes and must be given in
experience. For example, amongst other properties
we ascribe to the soul a <i>vis locomotiva</i> because
bodily movements actually arise whose cause lies in
the representation of them; without therefore meaning
to ascribe to it the only mode [of action] that we
know in moving forces (viz. by attraction, pressure,
impulse, and consequently motion, which always
presuppose an extended being). Just so we must
assume <i>something</i>, which contains the ground of the
possibility and practical reality, <i>i.e.</i> the practicability,
of a necessary moral final purpose; but we can think
of this, in accordance with the character of the effect
expected of it, as a wise Being governing the world
according to moral laws, and, conformably to the
constitution of our cognitive faculties, as a cause of
things distinct from nature, only in order to express
the <i>relation</i> of this Being (which transcends all our
cognitive faculties) to the Objects of <i>our</i> practical
Reason. We do not pretend thus to ascribe to it
theoretically the only causality of this kind known to
us, viz. an Understanding and a Will: we do not
even pretend to distinguish objectively the causality
thought in this Being, as regards what is <i>for us</i>
final purpose, from the causality thought in it as
regards nature (and its purposive determinations in
general). We can only assume this distinction as
subjectively necessary by the constitution of our
cognitive faculties, and as valid for the reflective, not
for the objectively determinant Judgement. But if we
come to practice, then such a <i>regulative</i> principle (of
prudence or wisdom) [commanding us] to act conformably
to that as purpose, which by the constitution
of our cognitive faculties can only be thought as
possible in a certain way, is at the same <i>constitutive</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i> practically determinant. Nevertheless, as a
principle for judging of the objective possibility of
things, it is no way theoretically determinant (<i>i.e.</i> it
does not say that the only kind of possibility which
belongs to the Object is that which belongs to our
thinking faculty), but is a mere <i>regulative</i> principle
for the reflective Judgement.</p>
<h6><i>Remark</i></h6>
<p>This moral proof is not one newly discovered,
although perhaps its basis is newly set forth; since
it has lain in man’s rational faculty from its earliest
germ, and is only continually developed with its
advancing cultivation. So soon as men begin to
reflect upon right and wrong—at a time when, quite
indifferent as to the purposiveness of nature, they
avail themselves of it without thinking anything
more of it than that it is the accustomed course of
nature—this judgement is inevitable, viz. that the
issue cannot be the same, whether a man has
behaved candidly or falsely, fairly or violently,
even though up to his life’s end, as far as can be
seen, he has met with no happiness for his virtues,
no punishment for his vices. It is as if they perceived
a voice within [saying] that the issue must
be different. And so there must lie hidden in
them a representation, however obscure, of something
after which they feel themselves bound to
strive; with which such a result would not agree,—with
which, if they looked upon the course of the
world as the only order of things, they could not
harmonise that inner purposive determination of
their minds. Now they might represent in various
rude fashions the way in which such an irregularity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
could be adjusted (an irregularity which must be
far more revolting to the human mind than the
blind chance that we are sometimes willing to use as
a principle for judging of nature). But they could
never think any other principle of the possibility of
the unification of nature with its inner ethical laws,
than a supreme Cause governing the world according
to moral laws; because a final purpose in them
proposed as duty, and a nature without any final
purpose beyond them in which that purpose might
be actualised, would involve a contradiction. As to
the [inner]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_136" id="FNanchor_136">136</a> constitution of that World-Cause they
could contrive much nonsense. But that moral
relation in the government of the world would
remain always the same, which by the uncultivated
Reason, considered as practical, is universally
comprehensible, but with which the speculative
Reason can make far from the like advance.—And
in all probability attention would be directed
first by this moral interest to the beauty and the
purposes in nature, which would serve excellently
to strengthen this Idea though they could not be
the foundation of it. Still less could that moral
interest be dispensed with, because it is only in
reference to the final purpose that the investigation
of the purposes of nature acquires that immediate
interest which displays itself in such a
great degree in the admiration of them without any
reference to the advantage to be derived from them.</p>
<h5 id="s89">§ 89. <i>Of the use of the moral argument</i></h5>
<p>The limitation of Reason in respect of all our
Ideas of the supersensible to the conditions of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>
practical employment has, as far as the Idea of God
is concerned, undeniable uses. For it prevents
<i>Theology</i> from rising into <span class="smcap">Theosophy</span> (into transcendent
concepts which confound Reason), or from
sinking into <span class="smcap">Demonology</span> (an anthropomorphic way
of representing the highest Being). And it also
prevents <i>Religion</i> from turning into <i>Theurgy</i> (a
fanatical belief that we can have a feeling of other
supersensible beings and can reciprocally influence
them), or into <i>Idolatry</i> (a superstitious belief that
we can please the Supreme Being by other means
than by a moral sentiment).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_137" id="FNanchor_137">137</a></p>
<p>For if we permit the vanity or the presumption
of sophistry to determine the least thing theoretically
(in a way that extends our knowledge) in respect
of what lies beyond the world of sense, or if we
allow any pretence to be made of insight into the
being and constitution of the nature of God, of
His Understanding and Will, of the laws of both
and of His properties which thus affect the world,
I should like to know where and at what point
we will bound these assumptions of Reason. For
wherever such insight can be derived, there may
yet more be expected (if we only strain our reflection,
as we have a mind to do). Bounds must then be
put to such claims according to a certain principle,
and not merely because we find that all attempts
of the sort have hitherto failed, for that proves
nothing against the possibility of a better result.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>
But here no principle is possible, except either to
assume that in respect of the supersensible absolutely
nothing can be theoretically determined (except
mere negations); or else that our Reason contains
in itself a yet unused mine of cognitions, reaching
no one knows how far, stored up for ourselves and
our posterity.—But as concerns Religion, <i>i.e.</i>
morals in reference to God as legislator, if the
theoretical cognition of Him is to come first, morals
must be adjusted in accordance with Theology;
and not only is an external arbitrary legislation
of a Supreme Being introduced in place of an
internal necessary legislation of Reason, but also
whatever is defective in our insight into the nature
of this Being must extend to ethical precepts, and
thus make Religion immoral and perverted.</p>
<p>As regards the hope of a future life, if instead of
the final purpose we have to accomplish in conformity
with the precept of the moral law, we ask
of our theoretical faculty of cognition a clue for the
judgement of Reason upon our destination (which
clue is only considered as necessary or worthy of
acceptance in a practical reference), then in this
aspect Psychology, like Theology, gives no more
than a negative concept of our thinking being.
That is, none of its actions or of the phenomena
of the internal sense can be explained materialistically;
and hence of its separate nature and of the
continuance or non-continuance of its personality
after death absolutely no ampliative determinant
judgement is possible on speculative grounds by
means of our whole theoretical cognitive faculty.
Here then everything is handed over to the
teleological judging of our existence in a practically
necessary aspect, and to the assumption of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
continuance as a condition requisite for the final
purpose absolutely furnished by Reason. And so
this advantage (which indeed at first glance seems
to be a loss) is apparent; that, as Theology for
us can never be Theosophy, or rational <i>Psychology</i>
become <i>Pneumatology</i>—an ampliative science—so
on the other hand this latter is assured of never
falling into <i>Materialism</i>. Psychology, rather, is a
mere anthropology of the internal sense, <i>i.e.</i> is the
knowledge of our thinking self <i>in life</i>; and, as
theoretical cognition, remains merely empirical.
On the other hand, rational Psychology, as far as
it is concerned with questions as to our eternal
existence, is not a theoretical science at all, but
rests on a single conclusion of moral Teleology;
as also its whole use is necessary merely on account
of the latter, <i>i.e.</i> on account of our practical
destination.</p>
<h5 id="s90">§ 90. <i>Of the kind of belief in a teleological proof
of the Being of God</i></h5>
<p>The first requisite for every proof, whether it
be derived from the immediate empirical presentation
(as in the proof from observation of the object
or from experiment) of that which is to be proved,
or by Reason <i>a priori</i> from principles, is this. It
should not <i>persuade</i>, but <i>convince</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_138" id="FNanchor_138">138</a> or at least should
tend to conviction. <i>I.e.</i> the ground of proof or
the conclusion should not be merely a subjective
(aesthetical) determining ground of assent (mere
illusion), but objectively valid and a logical ground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
of cognition; for otherwise the Understanding is
ensnared, but not convinced. Such an illusory
proof is that which, perhaps with good intent but
yet with wilful concealment of its weaknesses, is
adduced in Natural Theology. In this we bring
in the great number of indications of the origin
of natural things according to the principle of
purposes, and take advantage of the merely
subjective basis of human Reason, viz. its special
propensity to think only one principle instead of
several, whenever this can be done without contradiction;
and, when in this principle only one
or more requisites for determining a concept are
furnished, to add in our thought these additional
[features] so as to complete the concept of the
thing by arbitrarily supplementing it. For, in truth,
when we meet with so many products in nature
which are to us marks of an intelligent cause, why
should we not think One cause rather than many;
and in this One, not merely great intelligence,
power, etc., but rather Omniscience, and Omnipotence—in
a word, think it as a Cause that contains
the sufficient ground of such properties in
all possible things? Further, why should we not
ascribe to this unique, all-powerful, original Being
not only intelligence for natural laws and products,
but also, as to a moral Cause of the world, supreme,
ethical, practical Reason? For by this completion
of the concept a sufficient principle is furnished
both for insight into nature and for moral wisdom;
and no objection grounded in any way can be made
against the possibility of such an Idea. If now
at the same time the moral motives of the mind are
aroused, and a lively interest in the latter is added
by the force of eloquence (of which they are indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>
very worthy), then there arises therefrom a persuasion
of the objective adequacy of the proof; and
also (in most cases of its use) a wholesome illusion
which quite dispenses with all examination of its
logical strictness, and even on the contrary regards
this with abhorrence and dislike as if an impious
doubt lay at its basis.—Now against this there
is indeed nothing to say, so long as we only
have regard to its popular usefulness. But then
the division of the proof into the two dissimilar
parts involved in the argument—belonging to
physical and moral Teleology respectively—cannot
and must not be prevented. For the blending
of these makes it impossible to discern where the
proper force of the proof lies, and in what part
and how it must be elaborated in order that its
validity may be able to stand the strictest examination
(even if we should be compelled to
admit in one part the weakness of our rational
insight). Thus it is the duty of the philosopher
(supposing even that he counts as nothing the claims
of sincerity) to expose the above illusion, however
wholesome it is, which such a confusion can produce;
and to distinguish what merely belongs to persuasion
from that which leads to conviction (for these are
determinations of assent which differ not merely
in degree but in kind), in order to present plainly
the state of the mind in this proof in its whole
clearness, and to be able to subject it frankly to
the closest examination.</p>
<p>But a proof which is intended to convince, can
again be of two kinds; either deciding what the
object is <i>in itself</i>, or what it is <i>for us</i> (for men in
general) according to our necessary rational principles
of judgement (proof <span lang="grc">κατ’ ἀλήθειαν</span> or <span lang="grc">κατ’ ἄνθρωπον</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
the last word being taken in its universal signification
of man in general). In the first case it is based
on adequate principles for the determinant Judgement,
in the second for the reflective Judgement. In
the latter case it can never, when resting on merely
theoretical principles, tend to conviction; but if
a practical principle of Reason (which is therefore
universally and necessarily valid) lies at its basis,
it may certainly lay claim to conviction adequate
in a pure practical point of view, <i>i.e.</i> to moral
conviction. But a proof <i>tends to conviction</i>, though
without convincing, if it is [merely]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_139" id="FNanchor_139">139</a> brought on the
way thereto; <i>i.e.</i> if it contains in itself only objective
grounds, which although not attaining to certainty are
yet of such a kind that they do not serve merely for
persuasion as subjective grounds of the judgement.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_140" id="FNanchor_140">140</a></p>
<p>All theoretical grounds of proof resolve themselves
either into: (1) Proofs by logically strict
<i>Syllogisms of Reason</i>; or where this is not the case,
(2) <i>Conclusions</i> according to <i>analogy</i>; or where this
also has no place, (3) <i>Probable opinion</i>; or finally,
which has the least weight, (4) Assumption of a
merely possible ground of explanation, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Hypothesis</i>.—Now
I say that all grounds of proof in
general, which aim at theoretical conviction, can
bring about no belief of this kind from the highest
to the lowest degree, if there is to be proved the
proposition of the <i>existence</i> of an original Being, as
a God, in the signification adequate to the whole
content of this concept; viz. a <i>moral</i> Author of the
world, by whom the final purpose of creation is at
the same time supplied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>
(1.) As to the <i>logically accurate</i> proof proceeding
from universal to particular, we have sufficiently established
in the Critique the following: Since no intuition
possible for us corresponds to the concept of
a Being that is to be sought beyond nature—whose
concept therefore, so far as it is to be theoretically
determined by synthetical predicates, remains always
problematical for us—there is absolutely no cognition
of it to be had (by which the extent of our theoretical
knowledge is in the least enlarged). The particular
concept of a supersensible Being cannot be subsumed
under the universal principles of the nature of things,
in order to conclude from them to it, because those
principles are valid simply for nature, as an object
of sense.</p>
<p>(2.) We can indeed <i>think</i> one of two dissimilar
things, even in the very point of their dissimilarity,
in accordance with the <i>analogy</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_141" id="FNanchor_141">141</a> of the other; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>
we cannot, from that wherein they are dissimilar,
<i>conclude</i> from the one to the other by analogy, <i>i.e.</i>
transfer from the one to the other this sign of
specific distinction. Thus I can, according to the
analogy of the law of the equality of action and
reaction in the mutual attraction and repulsion of
bodies, also conceive of the association of the
members of a commonwealth according to rules of
right; but I cannot transfer to it those specific
determinations (material attraction or repulsion), and
ascribe them to the citizens in order to constitute a
system called a state.—Just so we can indeed
conceive of the causality of the original Being in
respect of the things of the world, as natural
purposes, according to the analogy of an Understanding,
as ground of the forms of certain products
which we call works of art (for this only takes place
on behalf of the theoretical or practical use that
we have to make by our cognitive faculty of this
concept in respect of the natural things in the world
according to a certain principle). But we can in
no way conclude according to analogy, because in
the case of beings of the world Understanding must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>
be ascribed to the cause of an effect which is judged
artificial, that in respect of nature the same causality
which we perceive in men attaches also to the Being
which is quite distinct from nature. For this concerns
the very point of dissimilarity which is thought
between a cause sensibly conditioned in respect of
its effects and the supersensible original Being itself
in our concept of it, and which therefore cannot be
transferred from one to the other.— In the very
fact that I must conceive the divine causality only
according to the analogy of an Understanding (which
faculty we know in no other being than in sensibly-conditioned
man) lies the prohibition to ascribe to
it this Understanding in its peculiar signification.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_142" id="FNanchor_142">142</a></p>
<p>(3.) <i>Opinion</i> finds in <i>a priori</i> judgements no
place whatever, for by them we either cognise
something as quite certain or else cognise nothing
at all. But if the given grounds of proof from
which we start (as here from the purposes in the
world) are empirical, then we cannot even with
their aid form any opinion as to anything beyond
the world of sense, nor can we concede to such
venturesome judgements the smallest claim to
probability. For probability is part of a certainty
possible in a certain series of grounds (its grounds
compare with the sufficient ground as parts with
a whole), the insufficient ground of which must be
susceptible of completion. But since, as determining
grounds of one and the same judgement, they
must be of the same kind, for otherwise they would
not together constitute a whole (such as certainty
is), one part of them cannot lie within the bounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
of possible experience and another outside all
possible experience. Consequently, since merely
empirical grounds of proof lead to nothing supersensible,
and since what is lacking in the series of
them cannot in any way be completed, we do not
approach in the least nearer in our attempt to attain
by their means to the supersensible and to a
cognition thereof. Thus in any judgement about
the latter by means of arguments derived from
experience, probability has no place.</p>
<p>(4.) If an <i>hypothesis</i> is to serve for the explanation
of the possibility of a given phenomenon, at
least its possibility must be completely certain.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_143" id="FNanchor_143">143</a> It
is sufficient that in an hypothesis I disclaim any
cognition of actuality (which is claimed in an
opinion given out as probable); more than this I
cannot give up. The possibility of that which I
place at the basis of my explanation, must at least
be exposed to no doubt; otherwise there would be
no end of empty chimeras. But to assume the
possibility of a supersensible Being determined
according to certain concepts would be a completely
groundless supposition. For here none of the conditions
requisite for cognition, as regards that in it
which rests upon intuition, is given, and so the sole
criterion of possibility remaining is the mere principle
of Contradiction (which can only prove the possibility
of the thought, not of the object thought).</p>
<p>The result then is this. For the existence
[Dasein] of the original Being, as a Godhead, or of
the soul as an immortal spirit, absolutely no proof
in a theoretical point of view is possible for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>
human Reason, which can bring about even the
least degree of belief. The ground of this is quite
easy to comprehend. For determining our Ideas
of the supersensible we have no material whatever,
and we must derive this latter from things in the
world of sense, which is absolutely inadequate for
such an Object. Thus, in the absence of all determination
of it, nothing remains but the concept of
a non-sensible something which contains the ultimate
ground of the world of sense, but which does not
furnish any knowledge (any amplification of the
concept) of its inner constitution.</p>

<p>If we look merely to the way in which anything
can be <i>for us</i> (according to the subjective constitution
of our representative powers) an Object of
knowledge (<i>res cognoscibilis</i>), then our concepts will
not cohere with Objects, but merely with our cognitive
faculties and the use which they can make of
a given representation (in a theoretical or practical
point of view). Thus the question whether anything
is or is not a cognisable being is not a question
concerning the possibility of things but of our
knowledge of them.</p>
<p><i>Cognisable</i> things are of three kinds: <i>things of
opinion</i> (<i>opinabile</i>); <i>things of fact</i> (<i>scibile</i>); and <i>things
of faith</i> (<i>mere credibile</i>).</p>
<p>(1.) Objects of mere rational Ideas, which for
theoretical knowledge cannot be presented in any
possible experience, are so far not <i>cognisable</i> things,
and consequently in respect of them we can form no
<i>opinion</i>; for to form an opinion <i>a priori</i> is absurd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>
in itself and the straight road to mere chimeras.
Either then our proposition is certain <i>a priori</i> or it
contains nothing for belief. Therefore <i>things of
opinion</i> are always Objects of an empirical cognition
at least possible in itself (objects of the world of
sense); but, which, on account merely of the [low]
degree of this faculty that we possess, is <i>for us</i>
impossible. Thus the ether of the new physicists,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_144" id="FNanchor_144">144</a>
an elastic fluid pervading all other matter (mingled
intimately with it) is a mere thing of opinion, yet is
such that, if our external senses were sharpened to
the highest degree, it could be perceived; though it
can never be presented in any observation or experiment.
To assume [the existence of] rational
inhabitants of other planets is a thing of opinion;
for if we could come closer to them, which is in
itself possible, we should decide by experience
whether they did or did not exist; but as we shall
never come so near, it remains in the region of
opinion. But to hold the opinion that there are in
the material universe pure thinking spirits without
bodies (viz. if we dismiss as unworthy of our notice
certain phenomena which have been published as
actual<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_145" id="FNanchor_145">145</a>) is to be called poetic fiction. This is no
thing of opinion, but a mere Idea which remains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>
over, when we remove from a thinking being everything
material, and only leave thought to it.
Whether then the latter (which we know only in
man, that is, in combination with a body) does
survive, we cannot decide. Such a thing is a
<i>sophistical being</i> (<i>ens rationis ratiocinantis</i>), not a
<i>rational being</i> (<i>ens rationis ratiocinatae</i>)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_146" id="FNanchor_146">146</a>; of which
latter it is possible to show conclusively, the
objective reality of its concept; at least for the
practical use of Reason, because this which has its
peculiar and apodictically certain principles <i>a priori</i>,
demands (postulates) it.</p>
<p>(2.) Objects for concepts, whose objective reality
can be proved (whether through pure Reason or
through experience, and, in the first case, from its
theoretical or practical data, in all cases by means of
a corresponding intuition) are <i>things of fact</i> (<i>res
facti</i>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_147" id="FNanchor_147">147</a> Of this kind are the mathematical properties
of magnitudes (in geometry), because they are susceptible
of a <i>presentation a priori</i> for the theoretical
use of Reason. Further, things or their characteristics,
which can be exhibited in experience
(either our own or that of others through the
medium of testimony) are likewise things of fact.—And,
what is very remarkable, there is one rational
Idea (susceptible in itself of no presentation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>
in intuition, and consequently, of no theoretical
proof of its possibility) which also comes under
things of fact. This is the Idea of <i>freedom</i>, whose
reality, regarded as that of a particular kind of
causality (of which the concept, theoretically considered,
would be transcendent), may be exhibited
by means of practical laws of pure Reason, and
conformably to this, in actual actions, and, consequently,
in experience.—This is the only one
of all the Ideas of pure Reason, whose object is a
thing of fact, and to be reckoned under the <i>scibilia</i>.</p>
<p>(3.) Objects, which in reference to the use of
pure practical Reason that is in conformity with
duty must be thought <i>a priori</i> (whether as consequences
or as grounds), but which are transcendent
for its theoretical use, are mere <i>things of faith</i>. Of
this kind is the <i>highest good</i> in the world, to be
brought about by freedom.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_148" id="FNanchor_148">148</a> The concept of this
cannot be established as regards its objective reality
in any experience possible for us and thus adequately
for the theoretical use of Reason; but its use is
commanded by practical pure Reason [in reference
to the best possible working out of that purpose],<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_149" id="FNanchor_149">149</a>
and it consequently must be assumed possible. This
commanded effect, <i>together with the only conditions
of its possibility thinkable by us</i>, viz. the Being of
God and the immortality of the soul, are <i>things of
faith</i> (<i>res fidei</i>), and of all objects are the only ones
which can be so called.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_150" id="FNanchor_150">150</a> For though what we learn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>
by <i>testimony</i> from the experience of others must be
believed by us, yet it is not therefore a thing of
faith; for it was the proper experience of some <i>one</i>
witness and so a thing of fact, or is presupposed as
such. Again it must be possible by this path (that
of historical faith) to arrive at knowledge; and the
Objects of history and geography, like everything
in general which it is at least possible to know by
the constitution of our cognitive faculties, belong
not to things of faith but to things of fact. It is
only objects of pure Reason which can be things of
faith at all, though not as objects of the mere pure
speculative Reason: for then they could not be
reckoned with certainty among things, <i>i.e.</i> Objects
of that cognition which is possible for us. They are
Ideas, <i>i.e.</i> concepts of the objective reality of which
we cannot theoretically be certain. On the other
hand, the highest final purpose to be worked out by
us, by which alone we can become worthy of being
ourselves the final purpose of creation, is an Idea
which has in a practical reference objective reality
for us, and is also a thing. But because we cannot
furnish such reality to this concept in a theoretical
point of view, it is a mere thing of faith of the pure
Reason, along with God and Immortality, as the
conditions under which alone we, in accordance with
the constitution of our (human) Reason, can conceive
the possibility of that effect of the use of our freedom
in conformity with law. But belief in things of faith
is a belief in a pure practical point of view, <i>i.e.</i> a
moral faith, which proves nothing for theoretical pure
rational cognition, but only for that which is practical
and directed to the fulfilment of its duties; it in no
way extends speculation or the practical rules of
prudence in accordance with the principle of self-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>love.
If the supreme principle of all moral laws is
a postulate, so is also the possibility of its highest
Object; and consequently, too, the condition under
which we can think this possibility is postulated
along with it and by it. Thus the cognition of
the latter is neither knowledge nor opinion of the
being and character of these conditions, regarded as
theoretical cognition; but is a mere assumption in
a reference which is practical and commanded for
the moral use of our Reason.</p>
<p>If we were able also plausibly to base upon the
purposes of nature, which physical Teleology presents
to us in such rich abundance, a <i>determinate</i>
concept of an intelligent World-Cause, then the
existence [Dasein] of this Being would not be
a thing of faith. For since this would not be
assumed on behalf of the performance of my duty,
but only in reference to the explanation of nature,
it would be merely the opinion and hypothesis most
conformable to our Reason. Now such Teleology
leads in no way to a determinate concept of God;
on the contrary, this can only be found in the concept
of a moral Author of the World, because this
alone furnishes the final purpose to which we can
only reckon ourselves [as attached] if we behave conformably
to what the moral law prescribes as final
purpose and consequently obliges us [to do]. Hence
it is only by its reference to the Object of our duty, as
the condition of the possibility of attaining the final
purpose of the same, that the concept of God attains
the privilege of counting as a thing of faith, in our
belief; but on the other hand, this same concept
cannot make its Object valid as a thing of fact.
For, although the necessity of duty is very plain
for practical Reason, yet the attainment of its final<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
purpose, so far as it is not altogether in our own
power, is only assumed on behalf of the practical
use of Reason, and therefore is not so practically
necessary as duty itself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_151" id="FNanchor_151">151</a></p>
<p><i>Faith</i> (as <i>habitus</i>, not as <i>actus</i>) is the moral
attitude of Reason as to belief in that which is unattainable
by theoretical cognition. It is therefore
the constant principle of the mind, to assume as true,
on account of the obligation in reference to it, that
which it is necessary to presuppose as condition of
the possibility of the highest moral final purpose<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_152" id="FNanchor_152">152</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
although its possibility or impossibility be alike
impossible for us to see into. Faith (absolutely so
called) is trust in the attainment of a design, the
promotion of which is a duty, but the possibility of
the fulfilment of which (and consequently also that
of the only conditions of it thinkable by us) is not to
be <i>comprehended</i> by us. Faith, then, that refers to
particular objects, which are not objects of possible
knowledge or opinion (in which latter case it ought
to be called, especially in historical matters, credulity
and not faith), is quite moral. It is a free belief, not
in that for which dogmatical proofs for the theoretically
determinant Judgement are to be found, or in
that to which we hold ourselves bound, but in that
which we assume on behalf of a design in accordance
with laws of freedom. This, however, is not,
like opinion, without any adequate ground; but, is
grounded as in Reason (although only in respect of
its practical employment), and <i>adequately for its
design</i>. For without this, the moral attitude of
thought in its repudiation of the claim of the theoretical
Reason for proofs (of the possibility of the
Objects of morality) has no permanence; but
wavers between practical commands and theoretical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
doubts. To be <i>incredulous</i> means to cling to
maxims, and not to believe testimony in general;
but he is <i>unbelieving</i>, who denies all validity to
rational Ideas, because there is wanting a <i>theoretical</i>
ground of their reality.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_154" id="FNanchor_154">154</a> He judges therefore dogmatically.
A dogmatical <i>unbelief</i> cannot subsist
together with a moral maxim dominant in the
mental attitude (for Reason cannot command one to
follow a purpose, which is cognised as nothing more
than a chimera); but a <i>doubtful faith</i> can. To this
the absence of conviction by grounds of speculative
Reason is only a hindrance, the influence of which
upon conduct a critical insight into the limits of
this faculty can remove, while it substitutes by way
of compensation a paramount practical belief.</p>
<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>
<p>If, in place of certain mistaken attempts, we
wish to introduce a different principle into philosophy
and to promote its influence, it makes us
highly contented to see how and why those attempts
must have disappointed us.</p>
<p><i>God</i>, <i>freedom</i>, and <i>immortality</i>, are the problems
at the solution of which all the equipments of Metaphysic
aim, as their ultimate and unique purpose.
Now it was believed that the doctrine of freedom is
needed for practical philosophy only as its negative
condition; but that on the other hand the doctrine
of God and of the constitution of the soul, as belonging
to theoretical philosophy, must be established for
themselves and separately, in order afterwards to
unite both with that which the moral law (possible
only under the condition of freedom) commands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>
and so to constitute a religion. But we can easily
see that these attempts must fail. For from mere
ontological concepts of things in general, or of the
existence of a necessary Being, it is possible to
form absolutely no determinate concept of an
original Being by means of predicates which can
be given in experience and can therefore serve for
cognition. Again a concept based on experience
of the physical purposiveness of nature could furnish
no adequate proof for morality, or consequently for
cognition of a Deity. Just as little could the cognition
of the soul by means of experience (which we
only apply in this life) supply us with a concept of
its spiritual immortal nature, a concept which would
be adequate for morality. <i>Theology</i> and <i>Pneumatology</i>,
regarded as problems of the sciences of a
speculative Reason, can be established by no
empirical data and predicates, because the concept
of them is transcendent for our whole cognitive
faculty.—The determination of both concepts,
God and the soul (in respect of its immortality)
alike, can only take place by means of predicates,
which, although they are only possible from a supersensible
ground, must yet prove their reality in
experience; for thus alone can they make possible
a cognition of a quite supersensible Being.—The
only concept of this kind to be met with in human
Reason is that of the freedom of men under moral
laws, along with the final purpose which Reason
prescribes by these laws. Of these two [the moral
laws and the final purpose] the first are useful for
ascribing to the Author of Nature, the second for
ascribing to man, those properties which contain the
necessary condition of the possibility of both [God
and the soul]; so that from this Idea a conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
can be drawn as to the existence and constitution
of these beings which are otherwise quite hidden
from us.</p>
<p>Thus the ground of the failure of the attempt
to prove God and immortality by the merely
theoretical path lies in this, that no cognition
whatever is possible of the supersensible in this
way (of natural concepts). The ground of its
success by the moral way (of the concept of
freedom) is as follows. Here the supersensible
(freedom), which in this case is fundamental, by
a determinate law of causality that springs from
it, not only supplies material for cognition of other
supersensibles (the moral final purpose and the
conditions of its attainability), but also establishes
its reality in actions as a fact; though at the same
time it can furnish a valid ground of proof in no
other than a practical point of view (the only one,
however, of which Religion has need).</p>
<p>It is thus very remarkable that of the three pure
rational Ideas, <i>God</i>, <i>freedom</i>, and <i>immortality</i>, that
of freedom is the only concept of the supersensible
which (by means of the causality that is thought in
it) proves its objective reality in nature by means of
the effects it can produce there; and thus renders
possible the connexion of both the others with
nature, and of all three together with Religion.
We have therefore in us a principle capable of
determining the Idea of the supersensible within
us, and thus also that of the supersensible without
us, for knowledge, although only in a practical
point of view; a principle this of which mere
speculative philosophy (which could give a merely
negative concept of freedom) must despair. Consequently
the concept of freedom (as fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>
concept of all unconditioned practical laws) can
extend Reason beyond those bounds, within which
every natural (theoretical) concept must remain
hopelessly limited.</p>
<h4 id="remark_3"> <i>General remark on Teleology</i></h4>
<p>If the question is, what rank the moral argument,
which proves the Being of God only as a thing of
faith for the practical pure Reason, maintains among
the other arguments in philosophy, it is easy to set
aside the whole achievement of this last; by which
it appears that there is no choice, but that our
theoretical faculty must give up all its pretensions
before an impartial criticism.</p>
<p>All belief must in the first place be grounded
upon facts, if it is not to be completely groundless;
and therefore the only distinction in proofs that
there can be is that belief in the consequence derived
therefrom can either be grounded on this fact as
<i>knowledge</i> for theoretical cognition, or merely as
<i>faith</i> for practical. All facts belong either to the
<i>natural concept</i> which proves its reality in the
objects of sense, given (or which may possibly be
given) before all natural concepts; or to the <i>concept
of freedom</i>, which sufficiently establishes its reality
through the causality of Reason in regard of certain
effects in the world of sense, possible through it,
which it incontrovertibly postulates in the moral law.
The natural concept (merely belonging to theoretical
cognition) is now either metaphysical and thinkable
completely <i>a priori</i>, or physical, <i>i.e.</i> thinkable <i>a
posteriori</i> and as necessary only through determinate
experience. The metaphysical natural concept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
(which presupposes no determinate experience) is
therefore ontological.</p>
<p>The <i>ontological</i> proof of the being of God from
the concept of an original Being is either that
which from ontological predicates, by which alone it
can be thought as completely determined, infers
absolutely necessary being; or that which, from the
absolute necessity of the being somewhere of some
thing, whatever it be, infers the predicates of the
original Being. For there belongs to the concept
of an original Being, inasmuch as it is not derived
from anything, the unconditioned necessity of its
presence, and (in order to represent this) its complete
determination by its [mere]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_155" id="FNanchor_155">155</a> concept. It was
believed that both requirements were found in the
concept of the ontological Idea of a <i>Being the most
real of all</i>; and thus two metaphysical proofs
originated.</p>
<p>The proof (properly called ontological) resting
upon a merely metaphysical natural concept concludes
from the concept of the Being the most real
of all, its absolutely necessary existence; for (it is
said), if it did not exist, a reality would be wanting
to it, viz. existence.—The other (which is also
called the metaphysico-<i>cosmological</i> proof) concludes
from the necessity of the existence somewhere of a
thing (which must be conceded, for a being is
given to us in self-consciousness), its complete
determination as that of a Being the most real of
all; for everything existing must be completely
determined, but the absolutely necessary (<i>i.e.</i> that
which <i>we</i> ought to cognise as such and consequently
<i>a priori</i>) must be completely determined <i>by
means of its own concept</i>. But this is only the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>
with the concept of a thing the most real of all.
It is not needful to expose here the sophistry in
both arguments, which has been already done elsewhere;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_156" id="FNanchor_156">156</a>
it is only needful to remark that neither
proof, even if they could be defended by all
manner of dialectical subtlety, could ever pass from
the schools into the world, or have the slightest
influence on the mere sound Understanding.</p>
<p>The proof, which rests on a natural concept
that can only be empirical and yet is to lead us
beyond the bounds of nature regarded as the
complex of the objects of sense, can be no other
than that derived from the <i>purposes</i> of nature. The
concept of these cannot, it is true, be given <i>a priori</i>
but only through experience; but yet it promises
such a concept of the original ground of nature as
alone, among all those which we can conceive, is
suited to the supersensible, viz. that of a highest
Understanding as Cause of the world. This, in fact,
it completely performs in accordance with principles
of the reflective Judgement, <i>i.e.</i> in accordance with
the constitution of our (human) faculty of cognition.—But
whether or not it is in a position to
supply from the same data this concept of a <i>supreme</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> independent intelligent Being, in short of a God
or Author of a world under moral laws, and consequently
as sufficiently determined for the Idea of a
final purpose of the being of the world—this is the
question upon which everything depends, whether
we desire a theoretically adequate concept of the
Original Being on behalf of our whole knowledge of
nature, or a practical concept for religion.</p>
<p>This argument derived from physical Teleology
is worthy of respect. It produces a similar effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
in the way of conviction upon the common Understanding
as upon the subtlest thinker; and a
<i>Reimarus</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_157" id="FNanchor_157">157</a> has acquired immortal honour in his
work (not yet superseded), in which he abundantly
develops this ground of proof with his peculiar
thoroughness and lucidity.—But how does this
proof acquire such mighty influence upon the mind?
How does a judgement by cold reason (for we
might refer to persuasion the emotion and elevation
of reason produced by the wonders of nature) issue
thus in a calm and unreserved assent? It is not the
physical purposes, which all indicate in the World
Cause an unfathomable intelligence; these are inadequate
thereto, because they do not satisfy the
need of the inquiring Reason. For, wherefore (it
asks) are all those natural things that exhibit art?
Wherefore is man himself, whom we must regard as
the ultimate purpose of nature thinkable by us?
Wherefore is this collective Nature here, and what
is the final purpose of such great and manifold art?
Reason cannot be contented with enjoyment or with
contemplation, observation, and admiration (which, if
it stops there, is only enjoyment of a particular kind)
as the ultimate final purpose for the creation of the
world and of man himself; for this presupposes a
personal worth, which man alone can give himself,
as the condition under which alone he and his being
can be the final purpose. Failing this (which alone
is susceptible of a definite concept), the purposes of
nature do not satisfactorily answer our questions;
especially because they cannot furnish any <i>determinate</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>
concept of the highest Being as an all-sufficient
(and therefore unique and so properly
called <i>highest</i>) being, and of the laws according to
which an Understanding is Cause of the world.</p>
<p>Hence that the physico-teleological proof convinces,
just as if it were a theological proof, does
not arise from our availing ourselves of the Ideas of
purposes of nature as so many empirical grounds of
proof of a <i>highest</i> Understanding. But it mingles
itself unnoticed with that moral ground of proof,
which dwells in every man and influences him
secretly, in the conclusion by which we ascribe to
the Being, which manifests itself with such incomprehensible
art in the purposes of nature, a final
purpose and consequently wisdom (without however
being justified in doing so by the perception of the
former); and by which therefore we arbitrarily fill
up the lacunas of the [design] argument. In fact it
is only the moral ground of proof which produces
conviction, and that only in a moral reference with
which every man feels inwardly his agreement.
But the physico-teleological proof has only the
merit of leading the mind, in its consideration of the
world, by the way of purposes and through them to
an <i>intelligent</i> Author of the world. The moral
reference to purposes and the Idea of a moral legislator
and Author of the world, as a theological
concept, seem to be developed of themselves out of
that ground of proof, although they are in truth pure
additions.</p>
<p>Henceforward we may allow the customary
statement to stand. For it is generally difficult (if
the distinction requires much reflection) for ordinary
sound Understanding to distinguish from one
another as heterogeneous the different principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>
which it confuses, and from one of which alone it
actually draws conclusions with correctness. The
moral ground of proof of the Being of God, properly
speaking, does not merely <i>complete</i> and render
perfect the physico-teleological proof; but it is a
special proof that <i>supplies</i> the conviction which is
wanting in the latter. This latter in fact can do
nothing more than guide Reason, in its judgements
upon the ground of nature and that contingent but
admirable order of nature only known to us by
experience, to the causality of a Cause containing
the ground of the same in accordance with purposes
(which we by the constitution of our cognitive
faculties must think as an intelligent cause); and
thus by arresting the attention of Reason it makes
it more susceptible of the moral proof. For what
is requisite to the latter concept is so essentially
different from everything which natural concepts
contain and can teach, that there is need of a
particular ground of proof quite independent of
the former, in order to supply the concept of the
original Being adequately for Theology and to
infer its existence.—The moral proof (which it
is true only proves the Being of God in a practical
though indispensable aspect of Reason) would preserve
all its force, if we found in the world no
material, or only that which is doubtful, for physical
Teleology. It is possible to conceive rational beings
surrounded by a nature which displayed no clear
trace of organisation but only the effects of a mere
mechanism of crude matter; on behalf of which and
amid the changeability of some merely contingent
purposive forms and relations there would appear
to be no ground for inferring an intelligent Author.
In such case there would be no occasion for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
physical Teleology; and yet Reason, which here
gets no guidance from natural concepts, would
find in the concept of freedom and in the moral
Ideas founded thereon a practically sufficient ground
for postulating the concept of the original Being
in conformity with these, <i>i.e.</i> as a Deity, and for
postulating nature (even the nature of our own
being) as a final purpose in accordance with freedom
and its laws—and all this in reference to the indispensable
command of practical Reason.—However
the fact that there is in the actual world for
the rational beings in it abundant material for
physical Teleology (even though this is not necessary)
serves as a desirable confirmation of the
moral argument, as far as nature can exhibit anything
analogous to the (moral) rational Ideas. For
the concept of a supreme Cause possessing intelligence
(though not reaching far enough for a
Theology) thus acquires sufficient reality for the
reflective Judgement, but it is not required as the
basis of the moral proof; nor does this latter serve
to complete as a proof the former, which does not
by itself point to morality at all, by means of an
argument developed according to a single principle.
Two such heterogeneous principles as nature and
freedom can only furnish two different kinds of
proof; and the attempt to derive one from the
other is found unavailing as regards that which is
to be proved.</p>
<p>If the physico-teleological ground of proof
sufficed for the proof which is sought, it would
be very satisfactory for the speculative Reason;
for it would furnish the hope of founding a Theosophy
(for so we must call the theoretical cognition
of the divine nature and its existence which would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span>
suffice at once for the explanation of the constitution
of the world and for the determination of moral laws).
In the same way if Psychology enabled us to arrive
at a cognition of the immortality of the soul it would
make Pneumatology possible, which would be just
as welcome to the speculative Reason. But neither,
agreeable as they would be to the arrogance of our
curiosity, would satisfy the wish of Reason in respect
of a theory which must be based on a cognition of
the nature of things. Whether the first, as Theology,
and the second, as Anthropology, when founded on
the moral principle, <i>i.e.</i> the principle of freedom, and
consequently in accordance with the practical use [of
Reason] do not better fulfil their objective final design,
is another question which we need not here pursue.</p>
<p>The physico-teleological ground of proof does
not reach to Theology, because it does not and
cannot give any determinate concept, sufficient
for this design, of the original Being; but we must
derive this from quite another quarter, or must
supply its lacuna by an arbitrary addition. You
infer, from the great purposiveness of natural forms
and their relations, a world-cause endowed with
Understanding; but what is the degree of this
Understanding? Without doubt you cannot assume
that it is the highest possible Understanding; because
for that it would be requisite that you should
see that a greater Understanding than that of which
you perceive proofs in the world, is not thinkable;
and this would be to ascribe Omniscience to yourself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_158" id="FNanchor_158">158</a>
In the same way, if you infer from the magnitude
of the world the very great might of its Author,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>
you must be content with this having only a comparative
significance for your faculty of comprehension;
for since you do not know all that is possible,
so as to compare it with the magnitude of the world
as far as you know it, you cannot infer the Almightiness
of its Author from so small a standard, and so on.
Now you arrive in this way at no definite concept
of an original Being available for a Theology; for
this can only be found in the concept of the totality
of perfections compatible with intelligence, and you
cannot help yourself to this by merely <i>empirical</i> data.
But without such a definite concept you cannot infer
a <i>unique</i> intelligent original Being; you can only
assume it (with whatever motive).—Now it may
certainly be conceded that you should arbitrarily
add (for Reason has nothing fundamental to say
to the contrary): Where so much perfection is
found, we may well assume that all perfection is
united in a unique Cause of the world, because
Reason succeeds better both theoretically and practically
with a principle thus definite. But then
you cannot regard this concept of the original Being
as proved by you, for you have only assumed it on
behalf of a better employment of Reason. Hence
all lamentation or impotent anger on account of
the alleged mischief of rendering doubtful the
coherency of your chain of reasoning, is vain pretentiousness,
which would fain have us believe that
the doubt here freely expressed as to your argument
is a doubting of sacred truth, in order that under
this cover the shallowness of your argument may
pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>Moral Teleology, on the other hand, which is
not less firmly based than physical,—which, indeed,
rather deserves the preference because it rests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>
<i>a priori</i> on principles inseparable from our Reason—leads
to that which is requisite for the possibility
of a Theology, viz. to a determinate <i>concept</i> of the
supreme Cause, as Cause of the world according
to moral laws, and, consequently, to the concept
of such a cause as satisfies our moral final purpose.
For this are required, as natural properties belonging
to it, nothing less than Omniscience, Omnipotence,
Omnipresence, and the like, which must be
thought as bound up with the moral final purpose
which is infinite and thus as adequate to it. Hence
moral Teleology alone can furnish the concept of
a <i>unique</i> Author of the world, which is available
for a Theology.</p>
<p>In this way Theology leads immediately to
<i>Religion</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>the recognition of our duties as divine
commands</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_159" id="FNanchor_159">159</a>; because it is only the recognition of
our duty and of the final purpose enjoined upon
us by Reason which brings out with definiteness
the concept of God. This concept, therefore, is
inseparable in its origin from obligation to that
Being. On the other hand, even if the concept
of the original Being could be also found determinately
by the merely theoretical path (viz. the
concept of it as mere Cause of nature), it would
afterwards be very difficult—perhaps impossible
without arbitrary interpolation [of elements]—to
ascribe to this Being by well-grounded proofs
a causality in accordance with moral laws; and
yet without this that quasi-theological concept
could furnish no foundation for religion. Even if
a religion could be established by this theoretical
path, it would actually, as regards sentiment
(wherein its essence lies) be different from that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>
which the concept of God and the (practical)
conviction of His Being originate from the fundamental
Ideas of morality. For if we must suppose
the Omnipotence, Omniscience, etc., of an Author
of the world as concepts given to us from another
quarter, in order afterwards only to apply our
concepts of duties to our relation to Him, then
these latter concepts must bear very markedly the
appearance of compulsion and forced submission.
If, instead of this, the respect for the moral law,
quite freely, in virtue of the precept of our own
Reason, represents to us the final purpose of our
destination, we admit among our moral views a
Cause harmonising with this and with its accomplishment,
with the sincerest reverence, which is quite
distinct from pathological fear; and we willingly
submit ourselves thereto.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_160" id="FNanchor_160">160</a></p>
<p>If it be asked why it is incumbent upon us to
have any Theology at all, it appears clear that
it is not needed for the extension or correction of
our cognition of nature or in general for any theory,
but simply in a subjective point of view for Religion,
<i>i.e.</i> the practical or moral use of our Reason. If
it is found that the only argument which leads to
a definite concept of the object of Theology is itself
moral, it is not only not strange, but we miss
nothing in respect of its final purpose as regards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span>
the sufficiency of belief from this ground of proof,
provided that it be admitted that such an argument
only establishes the Being of God sufficiently for
our moral destination, <i>i.e.</i> in a practical point of
view, and that here speculation neither shows its
strength in any way, nor extends by means of it
the sphere of its domain. Our surprise and the
alleged contradiction between the possibility of a
Theology asserted here and that which the Critique
of speculative Reason said of the Categories—viz.
that they can only produce knowledge when applied
to objects of sense, but in no way when applied
to the supersensible—vanish, if we see that they
are here used for a cognition of God not in a
theoretical point of view (in accordance with what
His own nature, inscrutable to us, may be) but
simply in a practical.—In order then at this
opportunity to make an end of the misinterpretation
of that very necessary doctrine of the Critique,
which, to the chagrin of the blind dogmatist, refers
Reason to its bounds, I add here the following
elucidation.</p>
<p>If I ascribe to a body <i>motive force</i> and thus
think it by means of the category of <i>causality</i>,
then I at the same time <i>cognise</i> it by that [category];
<i>i.e.</i> I determine the concept of it, as of an Object in
general, by means of what belongs to it by itself
(as the condition of the possibility of that relation)
as an object of sense. If the motive force ascribed
to it is repulsive, then there belongs to it (although
I do not place near it any other body upon which
it may exert force) a place in space, and moreover
extension, <i>i.e.</i> space in itself, besides the filling
up of this by means of the repulsive forces of
its parts. In addition there is the law of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
filling up (that the ground of the repulsion of the
parts must decrease in the same proportion as the
extension of the body increases, and as the space,
which it fills with the same parts by means of this
force, is augmented).—On the contrary, if I think
a supersensible Being as the first <i>mover</i>, and thus
by the category of causality as regards its determination
of the world (motion of matter), I must
not think it as existing in any place in space nor
as extended; I must not even think it as existing
in time or simultaneously with other beings. Hence
I have no determinations whatever, which could
make intelligible to me the condition of the possibility
of motion by means of this Being as its
ground. Consequently, I do not in the very least
cognise it by means of the predicate of Cause (as
first mover), for itself; but I have only the representation
of a something containing the ground
of the motions in the world; and the relation of
the latter to it as their cause, since it does not
besides furnish me with anything belonging to the
constitution of the thing which is cause, leaves its
concept quite empty. The reason of this is, that
by predicates which only find their Object in the
world of sense I can indeed proceed to the being of
something which must contain their ground, but not
to the determination of its concept as a supersensible
being, which excludes all these predicates. By
the category of causality, then, if I determine it
by the concept of a <i>first mover</i>, I do not in the
very least cognise what God is. Perhaps, however,
I shall have better success if I start from the
order of the world, not merely to <i>think</i> its causality
as that of a supreme <i>Understanding</i>, but to <i>cognise</i>
it by means of this determination of the said concept;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
because here the troublesome condition of
space and of extension disappears.—At all events
the great purposiveness in the world compels us
to <i>think</i> a supreme cause of it, and to <i>think</i> its
causality as that of an Understanding; but we are
not therefore entitled to <i>ascribe</i> this to it. (<i>E.g.</i>
we think of the eternity of God as presence in
all time, because we can form no other concept
of mere being as a quantum, <i>i.e.</i> as duration;
or we think of the divine Omnipresence as presence
in all places in order to make comprehensible to
ourselves His immediate presence in things which
are external to one another; without daring to ascribe
to God any of these determinations, as something
cognised in Him.) If I determine the causality of
a man, in respect of certain products which are
only explicable by designed purposiveness, by thinking
it as that of Understanding, I need not stop
here, but I can ascribe to him this predicate as a
well-known property and cognise him accordingly.
For I know that intuitions are given to the senses
of men and are brought by the Understanding
under a concept and thus under a rule; that this
concept only contains the common characteristic
(with omission of the particular ones) and is thus
discursive; and that the rules for bringing given
representations under a consciousness in general
are given by Understanding before those intuitions,
etc. I therefore ascribe this property to man as a
property by means of which I <i>cognise</i> him. However,
if I wish to <i>think</i> a supersensible Being (God)
as an intelligence, this is not only permissible in a
certain aspect of my employment of Reason—it is
unavoidable; but to ascribe to Him Understanding
and to flatter ourselves that we can <i>cognise</i> Him by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>
means of it as a property of His, is in no way permissible.
For I must omit all those conditions
under which alone I know an Understanding, and
thus the predicate which only serves for determining
man cannot be applied at all to a supersensible
Object; and therefore by a causality thus determined,
I cannot cognise what God is. And so it is
with all Categories, which can have no significance
for cognition in a theoretical aspect, if they are not
applied to objects of possible experience.—However,
according to the analogy of an Understanding
I can in a certain other aspect think a supersensible
being, without at the same time meaning thereby to
cognise it theoretically; viz. if this determination of
its causality concerns an effect in the world, which
contains a design morally necessary but unattainable
by a sensible being. For then a cognition of God
and of His Being (Theology) is possible by means
of properties and determinations of His causality
merely thought in Him according to analogy, which
has all requisite reality in a practical reference
though <i>only in respect of this</i> (as moral).—An
Ethical Theology is therefore possible; for though
morality can subsist without theology as regards its
rule, it cannot do so as regards the final design
which this proposes, unless Reason in respect of
it is to be renounced. But a Theological Ethic
(of pure Reason) is impossible; for laws which
Reason itself does not give and whose observance it
does not bring about as a pure practical faculty,
can not be moral. In the same way a Theological
Physic would be a nonentity, for it would propose no
laws of nature but ordinances of a Highest Will;
while on the other hand a physical (properly speaking
a physico-teleological) Theology can serve at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
least as a propaedeutic to Theology proper, by giving
occasion for the Idea of a final purpose which
nature cannot present by the observation of natural
purposes of which it offers abundant material. It
thus makes felt the need of a Theology which shall
determine the concept of God adequately for the
highest practical use of Reason, but it cannot develop
this and base it satisfactorily on its proofs.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="fn1"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_9" id="Footnote_9">9</a> If we have cause for supposing that concepts which we use as
empirical principles stand in relationship with the pure cognitive
faculty <i>a priori</i>, it is profitable, because of this reference, to seek for
them a transcendental definition; <i>i.e.</i> a definition through pure categories,
so far as these by themselves adequately furnish the distinction
of the concept in question from others. We here follow the example
of the mathematician who leaves undetermined the empirical data of
his problem, and only brings their relation in their pure synthesis
under the concepts of pure Arithmetic, and thus generalises the solution.
Objection has been brought against a similar procedure of
mine (cf. the Preface to the Critique of Practical Reason, <i>Abbott’s Translation</i>,
p. 94), and my definition of the faculty of desire has been
found fault with, viz. that it is [the being’s] <i>faculty of becoming by
means of its representations the cause of the actuality of the objects of
these representations</i>; for the desires might be mere <i>cravings</i>, and by
means of these alone every one is convinced the Object cannot be
produced.—But this proves nothing more than that there are desires
in man, by which he is in contradiction with himself. For here
he strives for the production of the Object by means of the representation
<i>alone</i>, from which he can expect no result, because he is conscious
that his mechanical powers (if I may so call those which are
not psychological) which must be determined by that representation to
bring about the Object (mediately) are either not competent, or even
tend towards what is impossible; e.g. to reverse the past (<i>O mihi
praeteritos</i> ... etc.), or to annihilate in the impatience of expectation
the interval before the wished for moment.—Although in such
fantastic desires we are conscious of the inadequacy (or even the
unsuitability) of our representations for being <i>causes</i> of their objects,
yet their reference as causes, and consequently the representation of
their <i>causality</i>, is contained in every <i>wish</i>; and this is specially
evident if the wish is an affection or <i>longing</i>. For these [longings]
by their dilatation and contraction of the heart and consequent exhaustion
of its powers, prove that these powers are continually kept on
the stretch by representations, but that they perpetually let the mind,
having regard to the impossibility [of the desire], fall back in exhaustion.
Even prayers for the aversion of great and (as far as one
can see) unavoidable evils, and many superstitious means for attaining
in a natural way impossible purposes, point to the causal reference
of representations to their Objects; a reference which cannot at all be
checked by the consciousness of the inadequacy of the effort to produce
the effect.—As to why there should be in our nature this propensity
to desires which are consciously vain, that is an anthropologico-teleological
problem. It seems that if we were not determined to the
application of our powers before we were assured of the adequacy of
our faculties to produce an Object, these powers would remain in great
part unused. For we commonly learn to know our powers only by
first making trial of them. This deception in the case of vain wishes
is then only the consequence of a benevolent ordinance in our nature.
[This note was added by Kant in the Second Edition.]</p></div>
<div class="footnote">
<p class="fn2"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_10" id="Footnote_10">10</a> One of the various pretended contradictions in this whole
distinction of the causality of nature from that of freedom is this.
It is objected that if I speak of <i>obstacles</i> which nature opposes to
causality according to (moral) laws of freedom or of the <i>assistance</i> it
affords, I am admitting an <i>influence</i> of the former upon the latter.
But if we try to understand what has been said, this misinterpretation
is very easy to avoid. The opposition or assistance is not
between nature and freedom, but between the former as phenomenon
and the <i>effects</i> of the latter as phenomena in the world of sense.
The causality of freedom itself (of pure and practical Reason) is the
causality of a natural cause subordinated to freedom (<i>i.e.</i> of the
subject considered as man and therefore as phenomenon). The
intelligible, which is thought under freedom, contains the ground of
the <i>determination</i> of this [natural cause] in a way not explicable any
further (just as that intelligible does which constitutes the supersensible
substrate of nature).</p></div>
<div class="footnote">
<p class="fn2"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_11" id="Footnote_11">11</a> It has been thought a doubtful point that my divisions in pure
Philosophy should always be threefold. But that lies in the nature
of the thing. If there is to be an <i>a priori</i> division it must be either
<i>analytical</i>, according to the law of contradiction, which is always
twofold (<i>quodlibet ens est aut A aut non A</i>); or it is <i>synthetical</i>.
And if in this latter case it is to be derived from <i>a priori concepts</i>
(not as in Mathematic from the intuition corresponding to the
concept), the division must necessarily be trichotomy. For according
to what is requisite for synthetical unity in general there must be
(1) a condition, (2) a conditioned, and (3) the concept which arises
from the union of the conditioned with its condition.</p></div>

regard a thing as a work of art, that is enough to make us admit
that its shape has reference to some design and definite purpose.
And hence there is no immediate satisfaction in the contemplation

strange. But since it actually takes its forms from nature (trees,

no concept of the object and its purpose (as in Architecture) conditioning

disapprobation of a treacherous art, which means to move men in
important matters like machines to a judgement that must lose all
weight for them on quiet reflection. Readiness and accuracy in
speaking (which taken together constitute Rhetoric) belong to
beautiful art; but the art of the orator (<i>ars oratoria</i>), the art of
availing oneself of the weaknesses of men for one’s own designs

be willing to enter upon life anew under the same conditions? who
would do so even according to a new, self-chosen plan (yet in conformity

We have shown above what value life has in virtue of what it
contains in itself, when lived in accordance with the purpose that
nature has along with us, and which consists in what we do (not
merely what we enjoy), in which, however, we are always but means
towards an undetermined final purpose. There remains then

<p class="fn3"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_131" id="Footnote_131">131</a> It would be possible that the happiness of rational beings in

its <i>ultimate</i> purpose. At least we cannot see <i>a priori</i> why nature
should not be so ordered, because by means of its mechanism this
effect would be certainly possible, at least so far as we see. But
morality, with a causality according to purposes subordinated thereto,
is absolutely impossible by means of natural causes; for the principle
by which it determines to action is supersensible, and is therefore
the only possible principle in the order of purposes that in respect of
nature is absolutely unconditioned. Its subject consequently alone
is qualified to be the <i>final purpose</i> of creation to which the whole of
nature is subordinated.—<i>Happiness</i>, on the contrary, as has been
shown in the preceding paragraphs by the testimony of experience,
is not even a <i>purpose of nature</i> in respect of man in preference to
other creatures; much less a <i>final purpose of creation</i>. Men may
of course make it their ultimate subjective purpose. But if I ask,
in reference to the final purpose of creation, why must men exist?
then we are speaking of an objective supreme purpose, such as the
highest Reason would require for creation. If we answer: These
beings exist to afford objects for the benevolence of that Supreme
Cause; then we contradict the condition to which the Reason of man
subjects even his inmost wish for happiness (viz. the harmony with
his own internal moral legislation). This proves that happiness can
only be a conditioned purpose, and that it is only as a moral being
that man can be the final purpose of creation; but that as concerns
his state happiness is only connected with it as a consequence,
according to the measure of his harmony with that purpose regarded
as the purpose of his being.</p></div>

accordance with</i> moral laws, <i>i.e.</i> a being who behaves himself in
conformity with them, who is the final purpose of creation. For by
using the latter expression we should be asserting more than we
know; viz. that it is in the power of an Author of the world to
cause man always to behave himself in accordance with moral
laws. But this presupposes a concept of freedom and of nature (of
which latter we can only think an external author), which would
imply an insight into the supersensible substrate of nature and its
identity with that which causality through freedom makes possible
in the world. And this far surpasses the insight of our Reason.
Only of <i>man under moral laws</i> can we say, without transgressing
the limits of our insight: his being constitutes the final purpose of
the world. This harmonises completely with the judgement of
human Reason reflecting morally upon the course of the world.
We believe that we perceive in the case of the wicked the traces of a
wise purposive reference, if we only see that the wanton criminal does
not die before he has undergone the deserved punishment of his
misdeeds. According to our concepts of free causality, our good
or bad behaviour depends on ourselves; we regard it the highest
wisdom in the government of the world to ordain for the first,
opportunity, and for both, their consequence, in accordance with moral
laws. In the latter properly consists the glory of God, which is
hence not unsuitably described by theologians as the ultimate
purpose of creation.— It is further to be remarked that when we
use the word creation, we understand nothing more than we have
said here, viz. the cause of the <i>being</i> of the world or of the things
in it (substances). This is what the concept properly belonging to
this word involves (<i>actuatio substantiae est creatio</i>); and consequently
there is not implied in it the supposition of a freely

Reason.— We should therefore not say: it is necessary <i>for morals</i>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="fn3"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_141" id="Footnote_141">141</a> <i>Analogy</i> (in a qualitative signification) is the identity of the
relation between reasons and consequences (causes and effects), so
far as it is to be found, notwithstanding the specific difference of the
things or those properties in them which contain the reason for like
consequences (<i>i.e.</i> considered apart from this relation). Thus we
conceive of the artificial constructions of beasts by comparing them
with those of men; by comparing the ground of those effects brought
about by the former, which we do not know, with the ground of
similar effects brought about by men (reason), which we do know;
<i>i.e.</i> we regard the ground of the former as an analogon of reason.
We then try at the same time to show that the ground of the artisan
faculty of beasts, which we call instinct, specifically different as it
is in fact from reason, has yet a similar relation to its effect (the
buildings of the beaver as compared with those of men).—But then
I cannot therefore conclude that because man uses <i>reason</i> for
his building, the beaver must have the like, and call this a
<i>conclusion</i> according to analogy. But from the similarity of the
mode of operation of beasts (of which we cannot immediately
perceive the ground) to that of men (of which we are immediately
conscious), we can quite rightly conclude <i>according to analogy</i>, that
beasts too act in accordance with <i>representations</i> (not as <i>Descartes</i>
has it, that they are machines), and that despite their specific
distinction they are yet (as living beings) of the same genus as
man. The principle of our right so to conclude consists in the
sameness of the ground for reckoning beasts in respect of the said
determination in the same genus with men, regarded as men, so far
as we can externally compare them with one another in accordance
with their actions. There is <i>par ratio</i>. Just so I can conceive,
according to the analogy of an Understanding, the causality of the
supreme World-Cause, by comparing its purposive products in the
world with the artificial works of men; but I cannot conclude
according to analogy to those properties in it [which are in man],
because here the principle of the possibility of such a method of
reasoning entirely fails, viz. the <i>paritas rationis</i> for counting the
Supreme Being in one and the same genus with man (in respect of
the causality of both). The causality of the beings of the world,
which is always sensibly conditioned (as is causality through Understanding)
cannot be transferred to a Being which has in common
with them no generic concept save that of Thing in general.</p></div>
<div class="footnote">
<p class="fn3"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_142" id="Footnote_142">142</a> We thus miss nothing in the representation of the relations of
this Being to the world, as far as the consequences, theoretical or
practical, of this concept are concerned. To wish to investigate
what it is in itself, is a curiosity as purposeless as it is vain.</p></div>

strange fascination for Kant. He says of two reported cases of
Swedenborg’s clairvoyance that he knows not how to disprove them

Swedenborgianism as folly. So in an early essay, <i>Dreams of a
Visionary explained by Dreams of Metaphysics</i>, he avows his
scepticism as to the value of the information which “psychical
research” can supply about the spirit-world, though he is careful not
to commit himself to any dogmatic statement on the subject of
ghosts. In the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (when discussing the
Postulates of Empirical Thought) he gives, as an instance of a
concept inconsistent with the canons of possibility, “a power of
being in a community of thought with other men, however distant
from us.”]</p></div>

not needful, not even feasible, to limit this expression merely to
actual experience, if we are talking of the relation of things to our

understand by the latter things of faith to the <i>confession</i> of which
(internal or external) we can be bound. Natural theology contains
nothing like this. For since they, as things of faith (like things
of fact) cannot be based on theoretical proofs, [they are accepted
by] a belief which is free and which only as such is compatible with
the morality of the subject.</p></div>
<div class="footnote">
<p class="fn3"><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#FNanchor_151" id="Footnote_151">151</a> The final purpose which the moral law enjoins upon us to
further, is not the ground of duty; since this lies in the moral law,
which, as formal practical principle, leads categorically, independently
of the Objects of the faculty of desire (the material of the will) and
consequently of any purpose whatever. This formal characteristic
of my actions (their subordination under the principle of universal
validity), wherein alone consists their inner moral worth, is quite in
our power; and I can quite well abstract from the possibility or the
unattainableness of purposes which I am obliged to promote in conformity
with that law (because in them consists only the external
worth of my actions) as something which is never completely in my
power, in order only to look to that which is of my doing. But then
the design of promoting the final purpose of all rational beings
(happiness so far as it is possible for it to be accordant with duty)
is even yet prescribed by the law of duty. The speculative Reason,
however, does not see at all the attainableness of this (neither on the
side of our own physical faculty nor on that of the co-operation of
nature). It must rather, so far as we can judge in a rational way,
hold the derivation, by the aid of such causes, of such a consequence
of our good conduct from mere nature (internal and external) without
God and immortality, to be an ungrounded and vain, though well-meant,
expectation; and if it could have complete certainty of this
judgement, it would regard the moral law itself as the mere deception
of our Reason in a practical aspect. But since the speculative Reason
fully convinces itself that the latter can never take place, but that on
the other hand those Ideas whose object lies outside nature can be
thought without contradiction, it must for its own practical law and the
problem prescribed thereby, and therefore in a moral aspect, recognise
those Ideas as real in order not to come into contradiction with itself.</p></div>

such as is contained in it, but such as I put into it and that on
morally adequate grounds.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_153" id="FNanchor_153">153</a> For a final purpose cannot be commanded
by any law of Reason without this latter at the same time
promising, however uncertainly, its attainableness; and thus justifying
our belief in the special conditions under which alone our Reason
can think it as attainable. The word <i>fides</i> expresses this; and it can
only appear doubtful, how this expression and this particular Idea
came into moral philosophy, since it first was introduced with
Christianity, and the adoption of it perhaps might seem to be only a
flattering imitation of Christian terminology. But this is not the only
case in which this wonderful religion with its great simplicity of statement
has enriched philosophy with far more definite and purer concepts
of morality, than it had been able to furnish before; but which,
once they are there, are <i>freely</i> assented to by Reason and are assumed
as concepts to which it could well have come of itself and which it
could and should have introduced.]</p></div>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
