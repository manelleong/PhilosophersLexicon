</div>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span>
translation of Kant’s essay on <i>Perpetual Peace</i> was undertaken by
Miss Mary Campbell Smith at the suggestion of the late Professor
Ritchie of St. Andrews, who had promised to write for it a preface,
indicating the value of Kant’s work in relation to recent discussions
regarding the possibility of “making wars to cease.” In view of the
general interest which these discussions have aroused and of the
vague thinking and aspiration which have too often characterised
them, it seemed to Professor Ritchie that a translation of this
wise and sagacious essay would be both opportune and valuable.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a> His
untimely death has prevented the fulfilment of his promise, and I
have been asked, in his stead, to introduce the translator’s work.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the only complete translation into English of
Kant’s essay, including all the notes as well as the text, and the
translator has added a full historical Introduction, along with
numerous notes of her own, so as (in Professor Ritchie’s words) “to
meet the needs (1) of the student of Political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span> Science who wishes to understand the
relation of Kant’s theories to those of Grotius, Hobbes, Locke,
Rousseau etc., and (2) of the general reader who wishes to understand
the significance of Kant’s proposals in connection with the ideals of
Peace Congresses, and with the development of International Law from
the end of the Middle Ages to the Hague Conference.”</p>
<p>Although it is more than 100 years since Kant’s essay was written,
its substantial value is practically unimpaired. Anyone who is
acquainted with the general character of the mind of Kant will
expect to find in him sound common-sense, clear recognition of the
essential facts of the case and a remarkable power of analytically
exhibiting the conditions on which the facts necessarily depend.
These characteristics are manifest in the essay on <i>Perpetual
Peace</i>. Kant is not pessimist enough to believe that a perpetual
peace is an unrealisable dream or a consummation devoutly to be
feared, nor is he optimist enough to fancy that it is an ideal which
could easily be realised if men would but turn their hearts to one
another. For Kant perpetual peace is an ideal, not merely as a
speculative Utopian idea, with which in fancy we may play, but as a
moral principle, which ought to be, and therefore can be, realised.
Yet he makes it perfectly clear that we cannot hope to approach the
realisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span> of
it unless we honestly face political facts and get a firm grasp of
the indispensable conditions of a lasting peace. To strive after the
ideal in contempt or in ignorance of these conditions is a labour
that must inevitably be either fruitless or destructive of its own
ends. Thus Kant demonstrates the hopelessness of any attempt to
secure perpetual peace between independent nations. Such nations may
make treaties; but these are binding only for so long as it is not
to the interest of either party to denounce them. To enforce them
is impossible while the nations remain independent. “There is,” as
Professor Ritchie put it (<i>Studies in Political and Social Ethics</i>,
p. 169), “only one way in which war between independent nations can
be prevented; and that is by the nations ceasing to be independent.”
But this does not necessarily mean the establishment of a despotism,
whether autocratic or democratic. On the other hand, Kant maintains
that just as peace between individuals within a state can only be
permanently secured by the institution of a “republican” (that is
to say, a representative) government, so the only real guarantee
of a permanent peace between nations is the establishment of a
federation of free “republican” states. Such a federation he regards
as practically possible. “For if Fortune ordains that a powerful
and enlightened people should form a republic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[p. viii]</span>—which by its very nature is inclined
to perpetual peace—this would serve as a centre of federal union for
other states wishing to join, and thus secure conditions of freedom
among the states in accordance with the idea of the law of nations.
Gradually, through different unions of this kind, the federation
would extend further and further.”</p>
<p>Readers who are acquainted with the general philosophy of Kant
will find many traces of its influence in the essay on <i>Perpetual
Peace</i>. Those who have no knowledge of his philosophy may find some
of his forms of statement rather difficult to understand, and it
may therefore not be out of place for me to indicate very briefly
the meaning of some terms which he frequently uses, especially in
the Supplements and Appendices. Thus at the beginning of the First
Supplement, Kant draws a distinction between the mechanical and the
teleological view of things, between “nature” and “Providence”, which
depends upon his main philosophical position. According to Kant, pure
reason has two aspects, theoretical and practical. As concerning
knowledge, strictly so called, the <i>a priori</i> principles of reason
(<i>e.g.</i> substance and attribute, cause and effect etc.) are valid
only within the realm of possible sense-experience. Such ideas, for
instance, cannot be extended to God, since He is not a possible
object of sense-experience. They are limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[p. ix]</span> to the world of phenomena. This world of
phenomena (“nature” or the world of sense-experience) is a purely
mechanical system. But in order to understand fully the phenomenal
world, the pure theoretical reason must postulate certain ideas
(the ideas of the soul, the world and God), the objects of which
transcend sense-experience. These ideas are not theoretically valid,
but their validity is practically established by the pure practical
reason, which does not yield speculative truth, but prescribes its
principles “dogmatically” in the form of imperatives to the will. The
will is itself practical reason, and thus it imposes its imperatives
upon itself. The fundamental imperative of the practical reason is
stated by Kant in Appendix I. (p. 175):—“Act so that thou canst will
that thy maxim should be a universal law, be the end of thy action
what it will.” If the end of perpetual peace is a duty, it must be
necessarily deduced from this general law. And Kant does regard it as
a duty. “We must desire perpetual peace not only as a material good,
but also as a state of things resulting from our recognition of the
precepts of duty” (<i>loc. cit.</i>). This is further expressed in the
maxim (p. 177):—“Seek ye first the kingdom of pure practical reason
and its righteousness, and the object of your endeavour, the blessing
of perpetual peace, will be added unto you.” The distinction between
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[p. x]</span> moral politician
and the political moralist, which is developed in Appendix I., is an
application of the general distinction between duty and expediency,
which is a prominent feature of the Kantian ethics. Methods of
expediency, omitting all reference to the pure practical reason, can
only bring about re-arrangements of circumstances in the mechanical
course of nature. They can never guarantee the attainment of their
end: they can never make it more than a speculative ideal, which may
or may not be practicable. But if the end can be shown to be a duty,
we have, from Kant’s point of view, the only reasonable ground for a
conviction that it is realisable. We cannot, indeed, theoretically
<i>know</i> that it is realisable. “Reason is not sufficiently enlightened
to survey the series of predetermining causes which would make it
possible for us to predict with certainty the good or bad results
of human action, as they follow from the mechanical laws of nature;
although we may hope that things will turn out as we should desire”
(p. 163). On the other hand, since the idea of perpetual peace
is a moral ideal, an “idea of duty”, we are entitled to believe
that it is practicable. “Nature guarantees the coming of perpetual
peace, through the natural course of human propensities; not indeed
with sufficient certainty to enable us to prophesy the future of
this ideal theoretically, but yet clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[p. xi]</span> enough for practical purposes” (p. 157).
One might extend this discussion indefinitely; but what has been said
may suffice for general guidance.</p>
<p>The “wise and sagacious” thought of Kant is not expressed in
a simple style, and the translation has consequently been a very
difficult piece of work. But the translator has shown great skill in
manipulating the involutions, parentheses and prodigious sentences
of the original. In this she has had the valuable help of Mr. David
Morrison, M.A., who revised the whole translation with the greatest
care and to whom she owes the solution of a number of difficulties.
Her work will have its fitting reward if it succeeds in familiarising
the English-speaking student of politics with a political essay of
enduring value, written by one of the master thinkers of modern
times.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TRANSLATOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span>
is an age of unions. Not merely in the economic sphere, in
the working world of unworthy ends and few ideals do we find
great practical organizations; but law, medicine, science, art,
trade, commerce, politics and political economy—we might add
philanthropy—standing institutions, mighty forces in our social
and intellectual life, all have helped to swell the number of our
nineteenth century Conferences and Congresses. It is an age of
Peace Movements and Peace Societies, of peace-loving monarchs and
peace-seeking diplomats. This is not to say that we are preparing
for the millennium. Men are working together, there is a newborn
solidarity of interest, but rivalries between nation and nation,
the bitternesses and hatreds inseparable from competition are
not less keen; prejudice and misunderstanding not less frequent;
subordinate conflicting interests are not fewer, are perhaps, in view
of changing political conditions and an ever-growing international
commerce, multiplying with every year. The talisman is, perhaps,
self-interest, but, none the less, the spirit of union is there;
it is impossible to ignore a clearly marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span> tendency towards international federation,
towards political peace. This slow movement was not born with Peace
Societies; its consummation lies perhaps far off in the ages to come.
History at best moves slowly. But something of its past progress
we shall do well to know. No political idea seems to have so great
a future before it as this idea of a federation of the world. It
is bound to realise itself some day; let us consider what are the
chances that this day come quickly, what that it be long delayed.
What obstacles lie in the way, and how may they be removed? What
historical grounds have we for hoping that they may ever be removed?
What, in a word, is the origin and history of the idea of a perpetual
peace between nations, and what would be the advantage, what is the
prospect of realising it?</p>
<p>The international relations of states find their expression, we
are told, in war and peace. What has been the part played by these
great counteracting forces in the history of nations? What has it
been in prehistoric times, in the life of man in what is called
the “state of nature”? “It is no easy enterprise,” says Rousseau,
in more than usually careful language, “to disentangle that which
is original from that which is artificial in the actual state of
man, and to make ourselves well acquainted with a state which no
longer exists, which perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p.
3]</span> never has existed and which probably never will exist in
the future.” (Preface to the <i>Discourse on the Causes of Inequality</i>,
1753, publ. 1754.) This is a difficulty which Rousseau surmounts
only too easily. A knowledge of history, a scientific spirit may
fail him: an imagination ever ready to pour forth detail never
does. Man lived, says he, “without industry, without speech,
without habitation, without war, without connection of any kind,
without any need of his fellows or without any desire to harm them
... sufficing to himself.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2">[2]</a> (<i>Discourse on the Sciences and Arts</i>,
1750.) Nothing, we are now certain, is less probable. We cannot
paint the life of man at this stage of his development with any
definiteness, but the conclusion is forced upon us that our
race had no golden age,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3" id="FNanchor_3">[3]</a> no peaceful beginning, that this early state
was indeed, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> Hobbes
held, a state of war, of incessant war between individuals, families
and, finally, tribes.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Early Conditions of Society.</i></p>
<p>For the barbarian, war is the rule; peace the exception. His
gods, like those of Greece, are warlike gods; his spirit, at death,
flees to some Valhalla. For him life is one long battle; his arms go
with him even to the grave. Food and the means of existence he seeks
through plunder and violence. Here right is with might; the battle is
to the strong. Nature has given all an equal claim to all things, but
not everyone can have them. This state of fearful insecurity is bound
to come to an end. “Government,” says Locke, (<i>On Civil Government</i>,
Chap. VIII., § 105) “is hardly to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> avoided amongst men that live together.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4" id="FNanchor_4">[4]</a> A
constant dread of attack and a growing consciousness of the necessity
of presenting a united front against it result in the choice of some
leader—the head of a family perhaps—who acts, it may be, only as
captain of the hosts, as did Joshua in Israel, or who may discharge
the simple duties of a primitive governor or king.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5" id="FNanchor_5">[5]</a> Peace within is found
to be strength without. The civil state is established, so that
“if there needs must be war, it may not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span> be against all men, nor yet without some
helps.” (Hobbes: <i>On Liberty</i>, Chap. I., § 13.) This foundation
of the state is the first establishment in history of a peace
institution. It changes the character of warfare, it gives it method
and system; but it does not bring peace in its train. We have now,
indeed, no longer a wholesale war of all against all, a constant
irregular raid and plunder of one individual by another; but we
have the systematic, deliberate war of community against community,
of nation against nation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6" id="FNanchor_6">[6]</a></p>
<p class="heading"><i>War in Classical Times.</i></p>
<p>In early times, there were no friendly neighbouring nations:
beyond the boundaries of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p.
7]</span> nation’s territory, lay the land of a deadly foe. This
was the way of thinking, even of so highly cultured a people as the
Greeks, who believed that a law of nature had made every outsider,
every barbarian their inferior and their enemy.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7" id="FNanchor_7">[7]</a> Their treaties of peace,
at the time of the Persian War, were frankly of the kind denounced
by Kant, mere armistices concluded for the purpose of renewing
their fighting strength. The ancient world is a world of perpetual
war in which defeat meant annihilation. In the East no right was
recognised in the enemy; and even in Greece and Rome the fate of the
unarmed was death or slavery.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8" id="FNanchor_8">[8]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p.
8]</span> barbaric or non-Grecian states had, according to Plato
and Aristotle, no claim upon humanity, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> rights in fact of any kind. Among the
Romans things were little better. According to Mr. T. J. Lawrence—see
his <i>Principles of International Law</i>, III., §§ 21, 22—they were
worse. For Rome stood alone in the world: she was bound by ties of
kinship to no other state. She was, in other words, free from a
sense of obligation to other races. War, according to Roman ideas,
was made by the gods, apart altogether from the quarrels of rulers
or races. To disobey the sacred command, expressed in signs and
auguries would have been to hold in disrespect the law and religion
of the land. When, in the hour of victory, the Romans refrained from
pressing their rights against the conquered—rights recognised by all
Roman jurists—it was from no spirit of leniency, but in the pursuit
of a prudent and far-sighted policy, aiming at the growth of Roman
supremacy and the establishment of a world-embracing empire, shutting
out all war as it blotted out natural boundaries, reducing all rights
to the one right of imperial citizenship. There was no real <i>jus
belli</i>, even here in the cradle of international law; the only limits
to the fury of war were of a religious character.</p>
<p>The treatment of a defeated enemy among the Jews rested upon
a similar religious foundation. In the East, we find a special
cruelty in the conduct of war. The wars of the Jews and Assyrians
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> wars of
extermination. The whole of the <i>Old Testament</i>, it has been said,
resounds with the clash of arms.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9" id="FNanchor_9">[9]</a> “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!”
was the command of Jehovah to his chosen people. Vengeance was
bound up in their very idea of the Creator. The Jews, unlike the
followers of Mahomet, attempted, and were commanded to attempt
no violent conversion<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10" id="FNanchor_10">[10]</a>; they were then too weak a nation; but they
fought, and fought with success against the heathen of neighbouring
lands, the Lord of Hosts leading them forth to battle. The God
of Israel stood to his chosen people in a unique and peculiarly
logical relation. He had made a covenant with them; and, in return
for their obedience and allegiance, cared for their interests and
advanced their national prosperity. The blood of this elect people
could not be suffered to intermix with that of idolaters. Canaan
must be cleared of the heathen, on the coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span> of the children of Israel to their
promised land; and mercy to the conquered enemy, even to women,
children or animals was held by the Hebrew prophets to be treachery
to Jehovah. (<i>Sam.</i> XV.; <i>Josh.</i> VI. 21.)</p>
<p>Hence the attitude of the Jews to neighbouring nations<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11" id="FNanchor_11">[11]</a>
was still more hostile than that of the Greeks. The cause of this
difference is bound up with the transition from polytheism to
monotheism. The most devout worshipper of the national gods of
ancient times could endure to see other gods than his worshipped
in the next town or by a neighbouring nation. There was no reason
why all should not exist side by side. Religious conflicts in
polytheistic countries, when they arose, were due not to the rivalry
of conflicting faiths, but to an occasional attempt to put one god
above the others in importance. There could be no interest here in
the propagation of belief through the sword. But, under the Jews,
these relations were entirely altered. Jehovah, their Creator, became
the one invisible God. Such an one can suffer no others near him;
their existence is a continual insult to him. Monotheism is, in its
very nature, a religion of intolerance. Its spirit among the Jews
was warlike: it commanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p.
12]</span> the subjugation of other nations, but its instrument was
rather extermination than conversion.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Attitude of Christianity and the Early Church
to War.</i></p>
<p>From the standpoint of the peace of nations, we may say that
the Christian faith, compared with other prominent monotheistic
religious systems, occupies an intermediate position between two
extremes—the fanaticism of Islam, and to a less extent of Judaism,
and the relatively passive attitude of the Buddhist who thought
himself bound to propagate his religion, but held himself justified
only in the employment of peaceful means. Christianity, on the other
hand, contains no warlike principles: it can in no sense be called
a religion of the sword, but circumstances gave the history of the
Church, after the first few centuries of its existence, a character
which cannot be called peace-loving.</p>
<p>This apparent contradiction between the spirit of the new religion
and its practical attitude to war has led to some difference of
opinion as to the actual teaching of Christ. The <i>New Testament</i>
seems, at a superficial glance, to furnish support as readily to the
champions of war as to its denouncers. The Messiah is the Prince of
Peace (<i>Is.</i> IX. 6, 7; <i>Heb.</i> VI.), and here lies the way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span> righteousness (<i>Rom.</i>
III. 19): but Christ came not to bring peace, but a sword (<i>Matth.</i>
X. 34). Such statements may be given the meaning which we wish them
to bear—the quoting of Scripture is ever an unsatisfactory form of
evidence; but there is no direct statement in the <i>New Testament</i> in
favour of war, no saying of Christ which, fairly interpreted, could
be understood too regard this proof of human imperfection as less
condemnable than any other.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12" id="FNanchor_12">[12]</a> When men shall be without sin, nation shall
rise up against nation no more. But man the individual can attain
peace only when he has overcome the world, when, in the struggle
with his lower self, he has come forth victorious. This is the
spiritual sword which Christ brought into the world—strife, not with
the unbeliever, but with the lower self: meekness and the spirit of
the Word of God are the weapons with which man must fight for the
Faith.</p>
<p>An elect people there was no longer: Israel had rejected its
Messiah. Instead there was a complete brotherhood of all men, the
bond and the free, as children of one God. The aim of the Church
was a world-empire, bound together by a universal religion. In
this sense, as sowing the first seeds of a universal peace, we
may speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> of
Christianity as a re-establishment of peace among mankind.</p>
<p>The later attitude of Christians to war, however, by no means
corresponds to the earliest tenets of the Church. Without doubt,
certain sects, from the beginning of our era and through the ages
up to the present time, held, like the Mennonites and Quakers in
our day, that the divine command, “Love your enemies,” could not be
reconciled with the profession of a soldier. The early Christians
were reproached under the Roman Emperors, before the time of
Constantine, with avoiding the citizen’s duty of military service.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13" id="FNanchor_13">[13]</a> “To
those enemies of our faith,” wrote Origen (<i>Contra Celsum</i>, VIII.,
Ch. LXXIII., Anti-Nicene Christian Library), “who require us to
bear arms for the commonwealth, and to slay men, we can reply:
‘Do not those who are priests at certain shrines, and those who
attend on certain gods, as you account them, keep their hands free
from blood, that they may with hands unstained and free from human
blood offer the appointed sacrifices to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span> gods; and even when war is upon you, you
never enlist the priests in the army. If that, then, is a laudable
custom, how much more so, that while others are engaged in battle,
these too should engage as the priests and ministers of God, keeping
their hands pure, and wrestling in prayers to God on behalf of those
who are fighting in a righteous cause, and for the king who reigns
righteously, that whatever is opposed to those who act righteously
may be destroyed!’ ... And we do take our part in public affairs,
when along with righteous prayers we join self-denying exercises and
meditations, which teach us to despise pleasures, and not to be led
away by them. And none fight better for the king than we do. We do
not indeed fight under him, although he require it; but we fight on
his behalf, forming a special army—an army of piety—by offering our
prayers to God.” The Fathers of the Church, Justin Martyr, Clement
of Alexandria, Tertullian, Ambrose and the rest gave the same
testimony against war. The pagan rites connected with the taking of
the military oath had no doubt some influence in determining the
feeling of the pious with regard to this life of bloodshed; but the
reasons lay deeper. “Shall it be held lawful,” asked Tertullian,
(<i>De Corona</i>, p. 347) “to make an occupation of the sword, when
the Lord proclaims that he who uses the sword shall perish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> by the sword? And shall
the son of peace take part in the battle when it does not become him
even to sue at law? And shall he apply the chain, and the prison, and
the torture, and the punishment, who is not the avenger even of his
own wrongs?”</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Church developed early in the opposite
direction. It was its fighting spirit and not a love of peace that
made Christianity a state religion under Constantine. Nor was
Augustine the first of the Church Fathers to regard military service
as permissible. To come to a later time, this change of attitude has
been ascribed partly to the rise of Mahometan power and the wave of
fanaticism which broke over Europe. To destroy these unbelievers
with fire and sword was regarded as a deed of piety pleasing to
God. Hence the wars of the Crusades against the infidel were holy
wars, and appear as a new element in the history of civilisation.
The nations of ancient times had known only civil and foreign war.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14" id="FNanchor_14">[14]</a>
They had rebelled at home, and they had fought mainly for material
interests abroad. In the Middle Ages there were, besides, religious
wars and, with the rise of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p.
17]</span> Feudalism, private war:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15" id="FNanchor_15">[15]</a> among all the powers
of the Dark Ages and for centuries later, none was more aggressive
than the Catholic Church, nor a more active and untiring defender of
its rights and claims, spiritual or temporal. It was in some respects
a more warlike institution than the states of Greece and Rome. It
struggled through centuries with the Emperor:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16" id="FNanchor_16">[16]</a> it pronounced its
ban against disobedient states and disloyal cities: it pursued
with its vengeance each heretical or rebellious prince: unmindful
of its early traditions about peace, it showed in every crisis a
fiercely military spirit.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17" id="FNanchor_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>For more than a thousand years the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span> counted fighting clergy<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18" id="FNanchor_18">[18]</a> among
its most active supporters. This strange anomaly was, it must be
said, at first rather suffered in deference to public opinion than
encouraged by ecclesiastical canons and councils, but it gave rise to
great discontent at the time of the Reformation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19" id="FNanchor_19">[19]</a> The whole question of
the lawfulness of military service for Christians was then raised
again. “If there be anything in the affairs of mortals,” wrote
Erasmus at this time (<i>Opera</i>, II., <i>Prov.</i>, 951 C) “which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> becomes us deliberately
to attack, which we ought indeed to shun by every possible means,
to avert and to abolish, it is certainly war, than which there is
nothing more wicked, more mischievous or more widely destructive
in its effects, nothing harder to be rid of, or more horrible and,
in a word, more unworthy of a man, not to say of a Christian.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20" id="FNanchor_20">[20]</a>
The mediæval Church indeed succeeded, by the establishment of
such institutions as the Truce of God, in setting some limits
to the fury of the soldier: but its endeavours (and it made
several to promote peace)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21" id="FNanchor_21">[21]</a> were only to a trifling extent successful.
Perhaps custom and public opinion in feudal Europe were too strong,
perhaps the Church showed a certain apathy in denouncing the evils of
a military society: no doubt the theoretical tenets of its doctrine
did less to hinder war than its own strongly military tendency,
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> lust for power
and the force of its example did to encourage it.</p>
<p>Hence, in spite of Christianity and its early vision of a
brotherhood of men, the history of the Middle Ages came nearer to a
realization of the idea of perpetual war than was possible in ancient
times. The tendency of the growth of Roman supremacy was to diminish
the number of wars, along with the number of possible causes of
racial friction. It united many nations in one great whole, and gave
them, to a certain extent, a common culture and common interests;
even, when this seemed prudent, a common right of citizenship. The
fewer the number of boundaries, the less the likelihood of war. The
establishment of great empires is of necessity a force, and a great
and permanent force working on the side of peace. With the fall of
Rome this guarantee was removed.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Development of the New Science of
International Law.</i></p>
<p>Out of the ruins of the old feudal system arose the modern
state as a free independent unity. Private war between
individuals or classes of society was now branded as a breach
of the peace: it became the exclusive right of kings to appeal
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> force.
War, wrote Gentilis<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22" id="FNanchor_22">[22]</a> towards the end of sixteenth century,
is the just or unjust conflict between states. Peace was now
regarded as the normal condition of society. As a result of these
great developments in which the name “state” acquired new meaning,
jurisprudence freed itself from the trammelling conditions of
mediæval Scholasticism. Men began to consider the problem of the
rightfulness or wrongfulness of war, to question even the possibility
of a war on rightful grounds. Out of theses new ideas—partly
too as one of the fruits of the Reformation,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23" id="FNanchor_23">[23]</a>—arose the first
consciously formulated principles of the science of international
law, whose fuller, but not yet complete, development belongs to
modern times.</p>
<p>From the beginning of history every age, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span> people has something
to show here, be it only a rudimentary sense of justice in their
dealings with one another. We may instance the Amphictyonic League
in Greece which, while it had a merely Hellenic basis and was mainly
a religious survival, shows the germ of some attempt at arbitration
between Greek states. Among the Romans we have the <i>jus feciale</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24" id="FNanchor_24">[24]</a>
and the <i>jus gentium</i>, as distinguished from the civil law of
Rome, and certain military regulations about the taking of booty
in war. Ambassadors were held inviolate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> in both countries; the formal declaration
of war was never omitted. Many Roman writers held the necessity of
a just cause for war. But nowhere do these considerations form the
subject matter of a special science.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages the development of these ideas received
little encouragement. All laws are silent in the time of war,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25" id="FNanchor_25">[25]</a> and
this was a period of war, both bloody and constant. There was no time
to think of the right or wrong of anything. Moreover, the Church
emphasised the lack of rights in unbelievers, and gave her blessing
on their annihilation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26" id="FNanchor_26">[26]</a> The whole Christian world was filled with
the idea of a spiritual universal monarchy. Not such as that in
the minds of Greek and Jew and Roman who had been able to picture
international peace only under the form of a great national and
exclusive empire. In this great Christian state there were to be no
distinctions between nations; its sphere was bounded by the universe.
But, here, there was no room or recognition for independent national
states with equal and personal rights. This recognition, opposed by
the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span> Church,
is the real basis of international law. The Reformation was the means
by which the personality of the peoples, the unity and independence
of the state were first openly admitted. On this foundation, mainly
at first in Protestant countries, the new science developed rapidly.
Like the civil state and the Christian religion, international law
may be called a peace institution.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>Grotius, Puffendorf and Vattel.</i></p>
<p>In the beginning of the seventeenth century, Grotius laid the
foundations of a code of universal law (<i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i>,
1625) independent of differences of religion, in the hope that its
recognition might simplify the intercourse between the newly formed
nations. The primary object of this great work, written during the
misery and horrors of the Thirty Years’ war, was expressly to draw
attention to these evils and suggest some methods by which the
severity of warfare might be mitigated. Grotius originally meant to
explain only one chapter of the law of nations:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27" id="FNanchor_27">[27]</a> his book was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span> be called <i>De Jure
Belli</i>, but there is scarcely any subject of international law which
he leaves untouched. He obtained, moreover, a general recognition
for the doctrine of the Law of Nature which exerted so strong an
influence upon succeeding centuries; indeed, between these two
sciences, as between international law and ethics, he draws no very
sharp line of demarcation, although, on the whole, in spite of an
unscientific, scholastic use of quotation from authorities, his
treatment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>
new field is clear and comprehensive. Grotius made the attempt to
set up an ethical principle of right, in the stead of such doctrines
of self-interest as had been held by many of the ancient writers.
There was a law, he held, established in each state purely with a
view to the interests of that state, but, besides this, there was
another higher law in the interest of the whole society of nations.
Its origin was divine; the reason of man commanded his obedience.
This was what we call international law.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28" id="FNanchor_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Grotius distinctly holds, like Kant and Rousseau, and unlike
Hobbes, that the state can never be regarded as a unity or
institution separable from the people; the terms <i>civitas</i>,
<i>communitas</i>, <i>coetus</i>, <i>populus</i>, he uses indiscriminately. But
these nations, these independent units of society cannot live
together side by side just as they like; they must recognise
one another as members of a European society of states.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29" id="FNanchor_29">[29]</a> Law,
he said, stands above force even in war, “which may only be begun
to pursue the right;” and the beginning and manner of conduct of
war rests on fixed laws and can be justified only in certain cases.
War is not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>
done away with: Grotius accepts it as fact,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30" id="FNanchor_30">[30]</a> (as Hobbes did later)
as the natural method for settling the disputes which were bound
constantly to arise between so many independent and sovereign
nations. A terrible scourge it must ever remain, but as the only
available form of legal procedure, it is sanctioned by the practice
of states and not less by the law of nature and of nations. Grotius
did not advance beyond this position. Every violation of the law
of nations can be settled but in one way—by war, the force of the
stronger.</p>
<p>The necessary distinction between law and ethics was
drawn by Puffendorf,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31" id="FNanchor_31">[31]</a> a successor of Grotius who gave an
outwardly systematic form to the doctrine of the great jurist,
without adding to it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p.
28]</span> either strength or completeness. His views, when they
were not based upon the system of Grotius, were strongly influenced
by the speculation of Hobbes, his chronological predecessor, to whom
we shall have later occasion to refer. In the works of Vattel,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32" id="FNanchor_32">[32]</a> who
was, next to Rousseau, the most celebrated of Swiss publicists, we
find the theory of the customs and practice in war widely developed,
and the necessity for humanising its methods and limiting its
destructive effects upon neutral countries strongly emphasised.
Grotius and Puffendorf, while they recommend acts of mercy, hold that
there is legally no right which requires that a conquered enemy shall
be spared. This is a matter of humanity alone. It is to the praise
of Vattel that he did much to popularise among the highest and most
powerful classes of society, ideas of humanity in warfare, and of
the rights and obligations of nations. He is, moreover, the first to
make a clear separation between this science and the Law of Nature.
What, he asks, is international law as distinguished from the Law
of Nature? What are the powers of a state and the duties of nations
to one another? What are the causes of quarrel among nations, and
what the means by which they can be settled without any sacrifice of
dignity?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span></p>
<p>They are, in the first place, a friendly conciliatory attitude;
and secondly, such means of settlement as mediation, arbitration and
Peace Congresses. These are the refuges of a peace-loving nation, in
cases where vital interests are not at stake. “Nature gives us no
right to use force, except where mild and conciliatory measures are
useless.” (<i>Law of Nations</i>, II. Ch. xviii. § 331.) “Every power owes
it in this matter to the happiness of human society to show itself
ready for every means of reconciliation, in cases where the interests
at stake are neither vital nor important.” (<i>ibid.</i> § 332.) At the
same time, it is never advisable that a nation should forgive an
insult which it has not the power to resent.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Dream of a Perpetual Peace.</i></p>
<p>But side by side with this development and gradual popularisation
of the new science of International Law, ideas of a less practical,
but not less fruitful kind had been steadily making their way
and obtaining a strong hold upon the popular mind. The Decree of
Eternal Pacification of 1495 had abolished private war, one of the
heavy curses of the Middle Ages. Why should it not be extended
to banish warfare between states as well? Gradually one proposal
after another was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p.
30]</span> to attain this end, or, at least, to smooth the way for
its future realisation. The first of these in point of time is to
be found in a somewhat bare, vague form in Sully’s <i>Memoirs</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33" id="FNanchor_33">[33]</a> said
to have been published in 1634. Half a century later the Quaker
William Penn suggested an international tribunal of arbitration
in the interests of peace.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34" id="FNanchor_34">[34]</a> But it was by the French Abbé St. Pierre
that the problem of perpetual peace was fairly introduced into
political literature: and this, in an age of cabinet and dynastic
wars, while the dreary cost of the war of the Spanish succession was
yet unpaid. St. Pierre was the first who really clearly realised and
endeavoured to prove that the establishment of a permanent state of
peace is not only in the interest of the weaker, but is required
by the European society of nations and by the reason of man. From
the beginning of the history of humanity, poets and prophets had
cherished the “sweet dream” of a peaceful civilisation: it is in the
form of a practical project that this idea is new.</p>
<p>The ancient world actually represented a state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> of what was almost
perpetual war. This was the reality which confronted man, his
inevitable doom, it seemed, as it had been pronounced to the fallen
sinners of Eden. Peace was something which man had enjoyed once, but
forfeited. The myth- and poetry-loving Greeks, and, later, the poets
of Rome delighted to paint a state of eternal peace, not as something
to whose coming they could look forward in the future, but as a
golden age of purity whose records lay buried in the past, a paradise
which had been, but which was no more. Voices, more scientific, were
raised even in Greece in attempts, such as Aristotle’s, to show
that the evolution of man had been not a course of degeneration
from perfection, but of continual progress upwards from barbarism
to civilisation and culture. But the change in popular thinking on
this matter was due less to the arguments of philosophy than to a
practical experience of the causes which operate in the interests
of peace. The foundation of a universal empire under Alexander the
Great gave temporary rest to nations heretofore incessantly at war.
Here was a proof that the Divine Will had not decreed that man was
to work out his punishment under unchanging conditions of perpetual
warfare. This idea of a universal empire became the Greek ideal of a
perpetual peace. Such an empire was, in the language of the Stoics,
a world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>-state in
which all men had rights of citizenship, in which all other nations
were absorbed.</p>
<p>Parallel to this ideal among the Greeks, we find the hope in
Israel of a Messiah whose coming was to bring peace, not only to
the Jewish race, but to all the nations of the earth. This idea
stands out in the sharpest contrast to the early nationalism of the
Hebrew people, who regarded every stranger as an idolater and an
enemy. The prophecies of Judaism, combined with the cosmopolitan
ideas of Greece, were the source of the idea, which is expressed in
the teaching of Christ, of a spiritual world-empire, an empire held
together solely by the tie of a common religion.</p>
<p>This hope of peace did not actually die during the first thousand
years of our era, nor even under the morally stagnating influences
of the Middle Ages. When feudalism and private war were abolished
in Europe, it wakened to a new life. Not merely in the mouths of
poets and religious enthusiasts was the cry raised against war, but
by scholars like Thomas More and Erasmus, jurists like Gentilis
and Grotius, men high in the state and in the eyes of Europe like
Henry IV. of France and the Duc de Sully or the Abbé de St. Pierre
whose <i>Projet de Paix Perpétuelle</i> (1713)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35" id="FNanchor_35">[35]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span> obtained immediate popularity and
wide-spread fame. The first half of the eighteenth century was
already prepared to receive and mature a plan of this kind.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>Henry IV. and St. Pierre.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Grand Dessein</i> of Henry IV. is supposed to have been formed
by that monarch and reproduced in Sully’s <i>Memoirs</i>, written in 1634
and discovered nearly a century later by St. Pierre. The story goes
that the Abbé found the book buried in an old garden. It has been
shewn, however, that there is little likelihood that this project
actually originated with the king, who probably corresponded fairly
well to Voltaire’s picture of him as war hero of the <i>Henriade</i>. The
plan was more likely conceived by Sully, and ascribed to the popular
king for the sake of the better hearing and greater influence it
might in this way be likely to have, and also because, thereby, it
might be less likely to create offence in political circles. St.
Pierre himself may or may not have been acquainted with the facts.</p>
<p>The so-called <i>Grand Dessein</i> of Henry IV. was, shortly,
as follows.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36" id="FNanchor_36">[36]</a> It proposed to divide Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> between fifteen Powers,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37" id="FNanchor_37">[37]</a> in
such a manner that the balance of power should be established and
preserved. These were to form a Christian republic on the basis
of the freedom and equality of its members, the armed forces of
the federation being supported by fixed contribution. A general
council, consisting of representatives from the fifteen states,
was to make all laws necessary for cementing the union thus formed
and for maintaining the order once established. It would also be
the business of this senate to “deliberate on questions that might
arise, to occupy themselves with discussing different interests, to
settle quarrels amicably, to throw light upon and arrange all the
civil, political and religious affairs of Europe, whether internal or
foreign.” (<i>Mémoires</i>, vol. VI., p. 129 <i>seq.</i>)</p>
<p>This scheme of the king or his minister was expanded with great
thoroughness and clear-sightedness by the Abbé St. Pierre: none of
the many later plans for a perpetual peace has been so perfect in
details. He proposes that there should be a permanent and perpetual
union between, if possible, all Christian sovereigns—of whom he
suggests nineteen, excluding the Czar—“to preserve unbroken peace
in Europe,” and that a permanent Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span> or senate should be formed by deputies
of the federated states. The union should protect weak sovereigns,
minors during a regency, and so on, and should banish civil as well
as international war—it should “render prompt and adequate assistance
to rulers and chief magistrates against seditious persons and
rebels.” All warfare henceforth is to be waged between the troops
of the federation—each nation contributing an equal number—and
the enemies of European security, whether outsiders or rebellious
members of the union. Otherwise, where it is possible, all disputes
occurring within the union are to be settled by the arbitration of
the senate, and the combined military force of the federation is
to be applied to drive the Turks out of Europe. There is to be a
rational rearrangement of boundaries, but after this no change is to
be permitted in the map of Europe. The union should bind itself to
tolerate the different forms of faith.</p>
<p>The objections to St. Pierre’s scheme are, many of them, obvious.
He himself produces sixty-two arguments likely to be raised against
his plan, and he examines these in turn with acuteness and eloquence.
But there are other criticisms which he was less likely to be able
to forestall. Of the nineteen states he names as a basis of the
federation, some have disappeared and the governments of others
have completely changed. Indeed St. Pierre’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span> scheme did not look far beyond the
present. But it has besides a too strongly political character.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38" id="FNanchor_38">[38]</a>
From this point of view, the Abbé’s plan amounts practically to
a European coalition against the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, we
notice with a smile that the French statesman and patriot is not
lost in the cosmopolitan political reformer. “The kingdom of Spain
shall not go out of the House of Bourbon!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39" id="FNanchor_39">[39]</a> France is to enjoy more
than the privileges of honour; she is to reap distinct material and
political advantages from the union. Humanity is to be a brotherhood,
but, in the federation of nations, France is to stand first.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40" id="FNanchor_40">[40]</a>
We see that these “rêves d’un homme de bien,” as Cardinal Dubois
called them, are not without their practical element. But the
great mistake of St. Pierre is this: he actually thought that
his plan could be put into execution in the near future, that an
ideal of this kind was realisable at once.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41" id="FNanchor_41">[41]</a> “I, myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> form’d it,” he says in
the preface, “in full expectation to see it one Day executed.” As
Hobbes, says, “there can be nothing so absurd, but may be found in
the books of philosophers.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42" id="FNanchor_42">[42]</a> St. Pierre was not content to make his
influence felt on the statesmen of his time and prepare the way for
the abolition of all arbitrary forms of government. This was the flaw
which drew down upon the good Abbé Voltaire’s sneering epigram<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43" id="FNanchor_43">[43]</a>
and the irony of Leibniz.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44" id="FNanchor_44">[44]</a> Here, above all, in this unpractical
enthusiasm his scheme differs from that of Kant.</p>
<p class="heading"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p.
38]</span><i>Rousseau’s Criticism of St. Pierre.</i></p>
<p>Rousseau took St. Pierre’s project<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45" id="FNanchor_45">[45]</a> much more seriously
than either Leibniz or Voltaire. But sovereigns, he thought, are deaf
to the voice of justice; the absolutism of princely power would never
allow a king to submit to a tribunal of nations. Moreover war was,
according to Rousseau’s experience, a matter not between nations, but
between princes and cabinets. It was one of the ordinary pleasures
of royal existence and one not likely to be voluntarily given up.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46" id="FNanchor_46">[46]</a> We
know that history has not supported Rousseau’s contention. Dynastic
wars are now no more. The Great Powers have shown themselves able
to impose their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>
own conditions, where the welfare and security of Europe have seemed
to demand it. Such a development seemed impossible enough in the
eighteenth century. In the military organisation of the nations of
Europe and in the necessity of making their internal development
subordinate to the care for their external security, Rousseau saw the
cause of all the defects in their administration.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47" id="FNanchor_47">[47]</a> The formation of
unions on the model of the Swiss Confederation or the German <i>Bund</i>
would, he thought, be in the interest of all rulers. But great
obstacles seemed to him to lie in the way of the realisation of such
a project as that of St. Pierre. “Without doubt,” says Rousseau in
conclusion, “the proposal of a perpetual peace is at present an
absurd one.... It can only be put into effect by methods which are
violent in themselves and dangerous to humanity. One cannot conceive
of the possibility of a federative union being established, except
by a revolution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>
And, that granted, who among us would venture to say whether this
European federation is to be desired or to be feared? It would work,
perhaps, more harm in a moment than it would prevent in the course of
centuries.” (<i>Jugement sur la Paix Perpétuelle.</i>)</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Position of Hobbes.</i></p>
<p>The most profound and searching analysis of this problem comes
from Immanuel Kant, whose indebtedness in the sphere of politics
to Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau it is difficult to
overestimate. Kant’s doctrine of the sovereignty of the people comes
to him from Locke through Rousseau. His explanation of the origin
of society is practically that of Hobbes. The direct influence on
politics of this philosopher, apart from his share in moulding the
Kantian theory of the state, is one we cannot afford to neglect. His
was a great influence on the new science just thrown on the world by
Grotius, and his the first clear and systematic statement we have of
the nature of society and the establishment of the state. The natural
state of man, says Hobbes, is a state of war,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48" id="FNanchor_48">[48]</a> a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span> <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>, where all
struggle for honour and for preferment and the prizes to which every
individual is by natural right equally entitled, but which can of
necessity fall only to the few, the foremost in the race. Men hate
and fear the society of their kind, but through this desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> to excel are forced to
seek it: only where there are many can there be a first. This state
of things, this apparent sociability which is brought about by and
coupled with the least sociable of instincts, becomes unendurable.
“It is necessary to peace,” writes Hobbes (<i>On Dominion</i>, Ch. VI.
3) “that a man be so far forth protected against the violence of
others, that he may live securely; that is, that he may have no just
cause to fear others, so long as he doth them no injury. Indeed, to
make men altogether safe from mutual harms, so as they cannot be
hurt or injuriously killed, is impossible; and, therefore, comes not
within deliberation.” But to protect them so far as is possible the
state is formed. Hobbes has no great faith in human contracts or
promises. Man’s nature is malicious and untrustworthy. A coercive
power is necessary to guarantee this long-desired security within the
community. “We must therefore,” he adds, “provide for our security,
not by compacts, but by punishments; and there is then sufficient
provision made, when there are so great punishments appointed for
every injury, as apparently it prove a greater evil to have done it,
than not to have done it. For all men, by a necessity of nature,
choose that which to them appears to be the less evil.” (<i>Op. cit.</i>,
Ch. VI. 4.)</p>
<p>These precautions secure that relative peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> within the state which is one of the
conditions of the safety of the people. But it is, besides, the duty
of a sovereign to guarantee an adequate protection to his subjects
against foreign enemies. A state of defence as complete and perfect
as possible is not only a national duty, but an absolute necessity.
The following statement of the relation of the state to other states
shows how closely Hobbes has been followed by Kant. “There are
two things necessary,” says Hobbes, (<i>On Dominion</i>, Ch. XIII. 7)
“for the people’s defence; to be warned and to be forearmed. <i>For
the state of commonwealths considered in themselves, is natural,
that is to say, hostile.</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49" id="FNanchor_49">[49]</a> Neither, if they cease from fighting, is it
therefore to be called peace; but rather a breathing time, in which
one enemy observing the motion and countenance of the other, values
his security not according to pacts, but the forces and counsels of
his adversary.”</p>
<p>Hobbes is a practical philosopher: no man was less a dreamer, a
follower after ideals than he. He is, moreover, a pessimist, and his
doctrine of the state is a political absolutism,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50" id="FNanchor_50">[50]</a> the form of
govern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span>ment which
above all has been, and is, favourable to war. He would no doubt have
ridiculed the idea of a perpetual peace between nations, had such
a project as that of St. Pierre—a practical project, counting upon
a realisation in the near future—been brought before him. He might
not even have accepted it in the very much modified form which Kant
adopts, that of an ideal—an unattainable ideal—towards which humanity
could not do better than work. He expected the worst possible from
man the individual. <i>Homo homini lupus.</i> The strictest absolutism,
amounting almost to despotism, was required to keep the vicious
propensities of the human animal in check. States he looked upon as
units of the same kind, members also of a society. They had, and
openly exhibited, the same faults as individual men. They too might
be driven with a strong enough coercive force behind them, but not
without it; and such a coercive force as this did not exist in a
society of nations. Federation and federal troops are terms which
represent ideas of comparatively recent origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span> Without something of this kind, any
enduring peace was not to be counted upon. International relations
were and must remain at least potentially warlike in character. Under
no circumstances could ideal conditions be possible either between
the members of a state or between the states themselves. Human nature
could form no satisfactory basis for a counsel of perfection.</p>
<p>Hence Hobbes never thought of questioning the necessity of war.
It was in his eyes the natural condition of European society; but
certain rules were necessary both for its conduct and, where this
was compatible with a nation’s dignity and prosperity, for its
prevention. He held that international law was only a part of the
Law of Nature, and that this Law of Nature laid certain obligations
upon nations and their kings. Mediation must be employed between
disputants as much as possible, the person of the mediators of
peace being held inviolate; an umpire ought to be chosen to decide
a controversy, to whose judgment the parties in dispute agree to
submit themselves; such an arbiter must be impartial. These are all
what Hobbes calls precepts of the Law of Nature. And he appeals to
the Scriptures in confirmation of his assertion that peace is the
way of righteousness and that the laws of nature of which these
are a few are also laws of the heavenly kingdom. But peace is like
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> straight path
of Christian endeavour, difficult to find and difficult to keep.
We must seek after it where it may be found; but, having done this
and sought in vain, we have no alternative but to fall back upon
war. Reason requires “that every man ought to endeavour peace,”
(<i>Lev.</i> I. Ch. XIV.) “as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and
when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps,
and advantages of war.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51" id="FNanchor_51">[51]</a> This, says Hobbes elsewhere, (<i>On Liberty</i>,
Ch. I. 15) is the dictate of right reason, the first and fundamental
law of nature.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>Kant’s Idea of a Perpetual Peace.</i></p>
<p>With regard to the problems of international law, Kant is of
course a hundred and fifty years ahead of Hobbes. But he starts from
the same point: his theory of the beginning of society is practically
identical with that of the older philosopher. Men are by nature
imperfect creatures, unsociable and untrustworthy, cursed by a love
of glory, of possession, and of power, passions which make happiness
something for ever unattainable by them. Hobbes is content to leave
them here with their imperfections, and let a strong government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span> help them out as it may.
But not so Kant. He looks beyond man the individual, developing
slowly by stages scarcely measurable, progressing at one moment,
and the next, as it seems, falling behind: he looks beyond the
individual, struggling and never attaining, to the race. Here Kant
is no pessimist. The capacities implanted in man by nature are not
all for evil: they are, he says, “destined to unfold themselves
completely in the course of time, and in accordance with the end
to which they are adapted.” (<i>Idea of a Universal History from a
Cosmopolitan Point of View</i>, 1784. Prop. 1.) This end of humanity is
the evolution of man from the stage of mere self-satisfied animalism
to a high state of civilisation. Through his own reason man is to
attain a perfect culture, intellectual and moral. In this long period
of struggle, the potential faculties which nature or Providence has
bestowed upon him reach their full development. The process in which
this evolution takes place is what we call history.</p>
<p>To man nature has given none of the perfect animal equipments
for self-preservation and self-defence which she has bestowed
on others of her creatures. But she has given to him reason and
freedom of will, and has determined that through these faculties
and without the aid of instinct he shall win for himself a complete
development of his capacities and natural endowments. It is,
says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> Kant, no happy
life that nature has marked out for man. He is filled with desires
which he can never satisfy. His life is one of endeavour and not of
attainment: not even the consciousness of the well-fought battle is
his, for the struggle is more or less an unconscious one, the end
unseen. Only in the race, and not in the individual, can the natural
capacities of the human species reach full development. Reason, says
Kant, (Prop. 2, <i>op. cit.</i>) “does not itself work by instinct, but
requires experiments, exercise and instruction in order to advance
gradually from one stage of insight to another. Hence each individual
man would necessarily have to live an enormous length of time, in
order to learn by himself how to make a complete use of all his
natural endowments. Or, if nature should have given him but a short
lease of life, as is actually the case, reason would then require an
almost interminable series of generations, the one handing down its
enlightenment to the other, in order that the seeds she has sown in
our species may be brought at last to a stage of development which
is in perfect accordance with her design.” Man the individual shall
travel towards the land of promise and fight for its possession,
but not he, nor his children, nor his children’s children shall
inherit the land. “Only the latest comers can have the good fortune
of inhabiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>
the dwelling which the long series of their predecessors have
toiled—though,” adds Kant, “without any conscious intent—to build up
without even the possibility of participating in the happiness which
they were preparing.” (Proposition 3.)</p>
<p>The means which nature employs to bring about this development of
all the capacities implanted in men is their mutual antagonism in
society—what Kant calls the “unsocial sociableness of men, that is to
say, their inclination to enter into society, an inclination which
yet is bound up at every point with a resistance which threatens
continually to break up the society so formed.” (Proposition 4.) Man
hates society, and yet there alone he can develop his capacities; he
cannot live there peaceably, and yet cannot live without it. It is
the resistance which others offer to his inclinations and will—which
he, on his part, shows likewise to the desires of others—that awakens
all the latent powers of his nature and the determination to conquer
his natural propensity to indolence and love of material comfort
and to struggle for the first place among his fellow-creatures, to
satisfy, in outstripping them, his love of glory and possession and
power. “Without those, in themselves by no means lovely, qualities
which set man in social opposition to man, so that each finds his
selfish claims resisted by the selfishness of all the others, men
would have lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span>
on in an Arcadian shepherd life, in perfect harmony, contentment,
and mutual love; but all their talents would forever have remained
hidden and undeveloped. Thus, kindly as the sheep they tended, they
would scarcely have given to their existence a greater value than
that of their cattle. And the place among the ends of creation which
was left for the development of rational beings would not have been
filled. Thanks be to nature for the unsociableness, for the spiteful
competition of vanity, for the insatiate desires of gain and power!
Without these, all the excellent natural capacities of humanity
would have slumbered undeveloped. Man’s will is for harmony; but
nature knows better what is good for his species: her will is for
dissension. He would like a life of comfort and satisfaction, but
nature wills that he should be dragged out of idleness and inactive
content and plunged into labour and trouble, in order that he may be
made to seek in his own prudence for the means of again delivering
himself from them. The natural impulses which prompt this effort,—the
causes of unsociableness and mutual conflict, out of which so many
evils spring,—are also in turn the spurs which drive him to the
development of his powers. Thus, they really betray the providence
of a wise Creator, and not the interference of some evil spirit
which has meddled with the world which God has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span> nobly planned, and enviously overturned
its order.” (Proposition 4: Caird’s translation in <i>The Critical
Philosophy of Kant</i>, Vol. II., pp. 550, 551.)</p>
<p>The problem now arises, How shall men live together, each free to
work out his own development, without at the same time interfering
with a like liberty on the part of his neighbour? The solution
of this problem is the state. Here the liberty of each member is
guaranteed and its limits strictly defined. A perfectly just civil
constitution, administered according to the principles of right,
would be that under which the greatest possible amount of liberty
was left to each citizen within these limits. This is the ideal
of Kant, and here lies the greatest practical problem which has
presented itself to humanity. An ideal of this kind is difficult of
realisation. But nature imposes no such duty upon us. “Out of such
crooked material as man is made,” says Kant, “nothing can be hammered
quite straight.” (Proposition 6.) We must make our constitution as
good as we can and, with that, rest content.</p>
<p>The direct cause of this transition from a state of nature
and conditions of unlimited freedom to civil society with its
coercive and restraining forces is found in the evils of that
state of nature as they are painted by Hobbes. A wild lawless
freedom becomes impossible for man: he is compelled to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span> seek the protection
of a civil society. He lives in uncertainty and insecurity: his
liberty is so far worthless that he cannot peacefully enjoy
it. For this peace he voluntarily yields up some part of his
independence. The establishment of the state is in the interest of
his development to a higher civilisation. It is more—the guarantee
of his existence and self-preservation. This is the sense, says
Professor Paulsen, in which Kant like Hobbes regards the state as
“resting on a contract,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52" id="FNanchor_52">[52]</a> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p.
53]</span> is to say, on the free will of all.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53" id="FNanchor_53">[53]</a> <i>Volenti non fit
injuria.</i> Only, adds Paulsen, we must remember that this contract
is not a historical fact, as it seemed to some writers of the
eighteenth century, but an “idea of reason”: we are speaking here not
of the history of the establishment of the state, but of the reason
of its existence. (Paulsen’s <i>Kant</i>, p. 354.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54" id="FNanchor_54">[54]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span></p>
<p>In this civil union, self-sought, yet sought reluctantly, man is
able to turn his most unlovable qualities to a profitable use. They
bind this society together. They are the instrument by which he wins
for himself self-culture. It is here with men, says Kant, as it is
with the trees in a forest: “just because each one strives to deprive
the other of air and sun, they compel each other to seek both above,
and thus they grow beautiful and straight. Whereas those that, in
freedom and isolation from one another, shoot out their branches at
will, grow stunted and crooked and awry.” (Proposition 5, <i>op. cit.</i>)
Culture, art, and all that is best in the social order are the fruits
of that self-loving unsociableness in man.</p>
<p>The problem of the establishment of a perfect civil constitution
cannot be solved, says this treatise (<i>Idea for a Universal
History</i>), until the external relations of states are regulated
in accordance with principles of right. For, even if the ideal
internal constitution were attained, what end would it serve in the
evolution of humanity, if commonwealths themselves were to remain
like individuals in a state of nature, each existing in uncontrolled
freedom, a law unto himself? This condition of things again cannot
be permanent. Nature uses the same means as before to bring about
a state of law and order. War, present or near at hand, the
strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span> of constant
preparation for a possible future campaign or the heavy burden of
debt and devastation left by the last,—these are the evils which must
drive states to leave a lawless, savage state of nature, hostile to
man’s inward development, and seek in union the end of nature, peace.
All wars are the attempts nature makes to bring about new political
relations between nations, relations which, in their very nature,
cannot be, and are not desired to be, permanent. These combinations
will go on succeeding each other, until at last a federation of all
powers is formed for the establishment of perpetual peace. This is
the end of humanity, demanded by reason. Justice will reign, not only
in the state, but in the whole human race when perpetual peace exists
between the nations of the world.</p>
<p>This is the point of view of the <i>Idea for a Universal History</i>.
But equally, we may say, law and justice will reign between
nations, when a legally and morally perfect constitution adorns the
state. External perpetual peace presupposes internal peace—peace
civil, social, economic, religious. Now, when men are perfect—and
what would this be but perfection—how can there be war? Cardinal
Fleury’s only objection—no light one—to St. Pierre’s project was
that, as even the most peace-loving could not avoid war, all men
must first be men of noble character. This seems to be what is
required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span> in the
treatise on <i>Perpetual Peace</i>. Kant demands, to a certain extent,
the moral regeneration of man. There must be perfect honesty in
international dealings, good faith in the interpretation and
fulfilment of treaties and so on (Art. 1)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55" id="FNanchor_55">[55]</a>: and again, every
state must have a republican constitution—a term by which Kant
understands a constitution as nearly as possible in accordance with
the spirit of right. (Art. 1.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56" id="FNanchor_56">[56]</a> This is to say that we have to start with
our reformation at home, look first to the culture and education
and morals of our citizens, then to our foreign relations. This is
a question of self-interest as well as of ethics. On the civil and
religious liberty of a state depends its commercial success. Kant
saw the day coming, when industrial superiority was to be identified
with political pre-eminence. The state which does not look to the
enlightenment and liberty of its subjects must fail in the race. But
the advantages of a high state of civilisation are not all negative.
The more highly developed the individuals who form a state, the more
highly developed is its consciousness of its obligations to other
nations. In the ignorance and barbarism of races lies the great
obstacle to a reign of law among states. Uncivilised states cannot be
conceived as members of a federation of Europe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> First, the perfect civil constitution
according to right: then the federation of these law-abiding Powers.
This is the path which reason marks out. The treatise on <i>Perpetual
Peace</i> seems to be in this respect more practical than the <i>Idea
for a Universal History</i>. But it matters little which way we take
it. The point of view is the same in both cases: the end remains
the development of man towards good, the order of his steps in this
direction is indifferent.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Political and Social Conditions of Kant’s
Time.</i></p>
<p>The history of the human race, viewed as a whole, Kant regards
as the realisation of a hidden plan of nature to bring about a
political constitution internally and externally perfect—the only
condition under which the faculties of man can be fully developed.
Does experience support this theory? Kant thought that, to a certain
degree, it did. This conviction was not, however, a fruit of his
experience of citizenship in Prussia, an absolute dynastic state,
a military monarchy waging perpetual dynastic wars of the kind he
most hotly condemned. Kant had no feeling of love to Prussia,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57" id="FNanchor_57">[57]</a>
and little of a citizen’s patriotic pride, or even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>terest, in its political
achievements. This was partly because of his sympathy with republican
doctrines: partly due to his love of justice and peculiar hatred of
war,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58" id="FNanchor_58">[58]</a>
a hatred based, no doubt, not less on principle than on a close
personal experience of the wretchedness it brings with it. It was
not the political and social conditions in which he lived which
fostered Kant’s love of liberty and gave him inspiration, unless
in the sense in which the mind reacts upon surrounding influences.
Looking beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>
Prussia to America, in whose struggle for independence he took a keen
interest, and looking to France where the old dynastic monarchy had
been succeeded by a republican state, Kant seemed to see the signs of
a coming democratisation of the old monarchical society of Europe. In
this growing influence on the state of the mass of the people who had
everything to lose in war and little to gain by victory, he saw the
guarantee of a future perpetual peace. Other forces too were at work
to bring about this consummation. There was a growing consciousness
that war, this costly means of settling a dispute, is not even a
satisfactory method of settlement. Hazardous and destructive in its
effect, it is also uncertain in its results. Victory is not always
gain; it no longer signifies a land to be plundered, a people to
be sold to slavery. It brings fresh responsibilities to a nation,
at a time when it is not always strong enough to bear them. But,
above all, Kant saw, even at the end of the eighteenth century, the
nations of Europe so closely bound together by commercial interests
that a war—and especially a maritime war where the scene of conflict
cannot be to the same extent localised as on land—between any two of
them could not but seriously affect the prosperity of the others.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59" id="FNanchor_59">[59]</a>
He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span> clearly realised
that the spirit of commerce was the strongest force in the service of
the maintenance of peace, and that in it lay a guarantee of future
union.</p>
<p>This scheme of a federation of the nations of the world, in
accordance with principles which would put an end to war between
them, was one whose interest for Kant seemed to increase during the
last twenty years of his life.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60" id="FNanchor_60">[60]</a> It was according to him an idea of reason,
and, in his first essay on the subject—that of 1784—we see the
place this ideal of a perpetual peace held in the Kantian system
of philosophy. Its realisation is the realisation of the highest
good—the ethical and political <i>summum bonum</i>, for here the aims
of morals and politics coincide: only in a perfect development of
his faculties in culture and in morals can man at last find true
happiness. History is working towards the consummation of this end. A
moral obligation lies on man to strive to establish conditions which
bring its realisation nearer. It is the duty of statesmen to form a
federative union as it was formerly the duty of individuals to enter
the state. The moral law points the way here as clearly as in the
sphere of pure ethics:—“Thou can’st, therefore thou ought’st.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span></p> <p>Let us
be under no misapprehension as to Kant’s attitude to the problem of
perpetual peace. It is an ideal. He states plainly that he so regards
it<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61" id="FNanchor_61">[61]</a>
and that as such it is unattainable. But this is the essence of
all ideals: they have not the less value in shaping the life and
character of men and nations on that account. They are not ends to
be realised but ideas according to which we must live, regulative
principles. We cannot, says Kant, shape our life better than in
acting as if such ideas of reason have objective validity and there
be an immortal life in which man shall live according to the laws of
reason, in peace with his neighbour and in freedom from the trammels
of sense.</p>
<p>Hence we are concerned here, not with an end, but with the means
by which we might best set about attaining it, if it were attainable.
This is the subject matter of the <i>Treatise on Perpetual Peace</i>
(1795), a less eloquent and less purely philosophical essay than that
of 1784, but throughout more systematic and practical. We have to do,
not with the favourite dream of philanthropists like St. Pierre and
Rousseau, but with a statement of the conditions on the fulfilment of
which the transition to a reign of peace and law depends.</p>
<p class="heading"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p.
62]</span><i>The Conditions of the Realisation of the Kantian
Ideal.</i></p>
<p>These means are of two kinds. In the first place, what evils
must we set about removing? What are the negative conditions? And,
secondly, what are the general positive conditions which will make
the realisation of this idea possible and guarantee the permanence
of an international peace once attained? These negative and
positive conditions Kant calls Preliminary and Definitive Articles
respectively, the whole essay being carefully thrown into the form of
a treaty. The Preliminary Articles of a treaty for perpetual peace
are based on the principle that anything that hinders or threatens
the peaceful co-existence of nations must be abolished. These
conditions have been classified by Kuno Fischer. Kant, he points
out,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62" id="FNanchor_62">[62]</a>
examines the principles of right governing the different sets of
circumstances in which nations find themselves—namely, (<i>a</i>) while
they are actually at war; (<i>b</i>) when the time comes to conclude a
treaty of peace; (<i>c</i>) when they are living in a state of peace.
The six Preliminary Articles fall naturally into these groups. War
must not be conducted in such a manner as to increase national
hatred and embitter a future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p.
63]</span> peace. (Art. 6.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63" id="FNanchor_63">[63]</a> The treaty which brings hostilities to an
end must be concluded in an honest desire for peace. (Art. 1.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64" id="FNanchor_64">[64]</a> Again
a nation, when in a state of peace, must do nothing to threaten the
political independence of another nation or endanger its existence,
thereby giving the strongest of all motives for a fresh war. A nation
may commit this injury in two ways: (1) indirectly, by causing
danger to others through the growth of its standing army (Art. 3)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65" id="FNanchor_65">[65]</a>—always
a menace to the state of peace—or by any unusual war preparations:
and (2) through too great a supremacy of another kind, by
amassing money, the most powerful of all weapons in warfare. The
National Debt (Art. 4)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66" id="FNanchor_66">[66]</a> is another standing danger to the peaceful
co-existence of nations. But, besides, we have the danger of actual
attack. There is no right of intervention between nations. (Art.
5.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67" id="FNanchor_67">[67]</a>
Nor can states be inherited or conquered (Art. 2),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68" id="FNanchor_68">[68]</a> or in any way treated
in a manner subversive of their independence and sovereignty as
individuals. For a similar reason, armed troops cannot be hired and
sold as things.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span></p>
<p>These then are the negative conditions of peace.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69" id="FNanchor_69">[69]</a>
There are, besides, three positive conditions:</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span></p> <p>(<i>a</i>)
The intercourse of nations is to be confined to a right of
hospitality. (Art. 3.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70" id="FNanchor_70">[70]</a> There is nothing new to us in this
assertion of a right of way. The right to free means of international
communication has in the last hundred years become a commonplace of
law. And the change has been brought about, as Kant anticipated,
not through an abstract respect for the idea of right, but through
the pressure of purely commercial interests. Since Kant’s time
the nations of Europe have all been more or less transformed from
agricultural to commercial states whose interests run mainly in the
same direction, whose existence and development depend necessarily
upon “conditions of universal hospitality.” Commerce depends upon
this freedom of international intercourse, and on commerce mainly
depends our hope of peace.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The first Definitive Article<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71" id="FNanchor_71">[71]</a> requires that the
constitution of every state should be republican. What Kant
understands by this term is that, in the state, law should rule
above force and that its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p.
66]</span> constitution should be a representative one, guaranteeing
public justice and based on the freedom and equality of its members
and their mutual dependence on a common legislature. Kant’s demand
is independent of the <i>form</i> of the government. A constitutional
monarchy like that of Prussia in the time of Frederick the Great,
who regarded himself as the first servant of the state and ruled
with the wisdom and forethought which the nation would have had
the right to demand from such an one—such a monarchy is not in
contradiction to the idea of a true republic. That the state should
have a constitution in accordance with the principles of right
is the essential point.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_72" id="FNanchor_72">[72]</a> To make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span> this possible, the law-giving power
must lie with the representatives of the people: there must be a
complete separation, such as Locke and Rousseau demand, between
the legislature and executive. Otherwise we have despotism. Hence,
while Kant admitted absolutism under certain conditions, he rejected
democracy where, in his opinion, the mass of the people was
despot.</p>
<p>An internal constitution, firmly established on the principles of
right, would not only serve to kill the seeds of national hatred and
diminish the likelihood of foreign war. It would do more: it would
destroy sources of revolution and discontent within the state. Kant,
like many writers on this subject, does not directly allude to civil
war<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73" id="FNanchor_73">[73]</a>
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span> the means by
which it may be prevented or abolished. Actually to achieve this
would be impossible: it is beyond the power of either arbitration or
disarmament. But in a representative government and the liberty of a
people lie the greatest safeguards against internal discontent. Civil
peace and international peace must to a certain extent go hand in
hand.</p>
<p>We come now to the central idea of the treatise: (<i>c</i>) the law
of nations must be based upon a federation of free states. (Art.
2.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74" id="FNanchor_74">[74]</a>
This must be regarded as the end to which mankind is advancing. The
problem here is not out of many nations to make one. This would
be perhaps the surest way to attain peace, but it is scarcely
practicable, and, in certain forms, it is undesirable. Kant is
inclined to approve of the separation of nations by language and
religion, by historical and social tradition and physical boundaries:
nature seems to condemn the idea of a universal monarchy.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75" id="FNanchor_75">[75]</a> The
only footing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
on which a thorough-going, indubitable system of international
law is in practice possible is that of the society of nations:
not the world-republic<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76" id="FNanchor_76">[76]</a> the Greeks dreamt of, but a federation of
states. Such a union in the interests of perpetual peace between
nations would be the “highest political good.” The relation of the
federated states to one another and to the whole would be fixed by
cosmopolitan law: the link of self-interest which would bind them
would again be the spirit of commerce.</p>
<p>This scheme of a perpetual peace had not escaped ridicule
in the eighteenth century: the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span> Kant protected it henceforth. The facts
of history, even more conclusively than the voices of philosophers,
soldiers and princes, show how great has been the progress of this
idea in recent years. But it has not gained its present hold upon the
popular mind without great and lasting opposition. Indeed we have
here what must still be regarded as a controversial question. There
have been, and are still, men who regard perpetual peace as a state
of things as undesirable as it is unattainable. For such persons,
war is a necessity of our civilisation: it is impossible that it
should ever cease to exist. All that we can do, and there is no
harm, nor any contradiction in the attempt, is to make wars shorter,
fewer and more humane: the whole question, beyond this, is without
practical significance. Others, on the other hand,—and these perhaps
more thoughtful—regard war as hostile to culture, an evil of the
worst kind, although a necessary evil. In peace, for them, lies the
true ideal of humanity, although in any perfect form this cannot be
realised in the near future. The extreme forms of these views are to
be sought in what has been called in Germany “the philosophy of the
barracks” which comes forward with a glorification of war for its own
sake, and in the attitude of modern Peace Societies which denounce
all war wholesale, without respect of causes or conditions.</p>
<p class="heading"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p.
71]</span><i>Hegel, Schiller and Moltke.</i></p>
<p>Hegel, the greatest of the champions of war, would have nothing
to do with Kant’s federation of nations formed in the interests
of peace. The welfare of a state, he held, is its own highest
law; and he refused to admit that this welfare was to be sought
in an international peace. Hegel lived in an age when all power
and order seemed to lie with the sword. Something of the charm of
Napoleonism seems to hang over him. He does not go the length of
writers like Joseph de Maistre, who see in war the finger of God
or an arrangement for the survival of the fittest—a theory, as
far as regards individuals, quite in contradiction with the real
facts, which show that it is precisely the physically unfit whom
war, as a method of extermination, cannot reach. But, like Schiller
and Moltke, Hegel sees in war an educative instrument, developing
virtues in a nation which could not be fully developed otherwise,
(much as pain and suffering bring patience and resignation and other
such qualities into play in the individual), and drawing the nation
together, making each citizen conscious of his citizenship, as no
other influence can. War, he holds, leaves a nation always stronger
than it was before; it buries causes of inner dissension, and
consolidates the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>
internal power of the state.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77" id="FNanchor_77">[77]</a> No other trial can, in the same way, show
what is the real strength and weakness of a nation, what it <i>is</i>, not
merely materially, but physically, intellectually and morally.</p>
<p>With this last statement most people will be inclined to agree.
There is only a part of the truth in Napoleon’s dictum that “God is
on the side of the biggest battalions”; or in the old saying that war
requires three necessaries—in the first place, money; in the second
place, money; and in the third, money. Money is a great deal: it is a
necessity; but what we call national back-bone and character is more.
So far we are with Hegel. But he goes further. In peace, says he,
mankind would grow effeminate and degenerate in luxury. This opinion
was expressed in forcible language in his own time by Schiller,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_78" id="FNanchor_78">[78]</a>
and in more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>
recent years by Count Moltke. “Perpetual peace,” says a letter
of the great general,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79" id="FNanchor_79">[79]</a> “is a dream and not a beautiful dream
either: war is part of the divine order of the world. During war
are developed the noblest virtues which belong to man—courage and
self-denial, fidelity to duty and the spirit of self-sacrifice:
the soldier is called upon to risk his life. Without war the world
would sink in materialism.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80" id="FNanchor_80">[80]</a> “Want and misery, disease, suffering
and war,” he says elsewhere, “are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> given elements in the Divine order
of the universe.” Moltke’s eulogy of war, however, is somewhat
modified by his additional statement that “the greatest kindness in
war lies in its being quickly ended.” (Letter to Bluntschli, 11th
Dec.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span> 1880.)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81" id="FNanchor_81">[81]</a> The
great forces which we recognise as factors in the moral regeneration
of mankind are always slow of action as they are sure. War, if too
quickly over, could not have the great moral influence which has been
attributed to it. The explanation may be that it is not all that it
naturally appears to a great and successful general. Hegel, Moltke,
Trendelenburg, Treitschke<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_82" id="FNanchor_82">[82]</a> and the others—not Schiller<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_83" id="FNanchor_83">[83]</a> who
was able to sing the blessings of peace as eloquently as of war—were
apt to forget that war is as efficient a school for forming vices
as virtues; and that, moreover, those virtues which military life
is said to cultivate—courage, self-sacrifice and the rest—can be at
least as perfectly developed in other trials. There are in human
life dangers every day bravely met and overcome which are not less
terrible than those which face the soldier, in whom patriotism may
be less a sentiment than a duty, and whose cowardice must be dearly
paid.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>War under Altered Conditions.</i></p>
<p>The Peace Societies of our century, untiring supporters of a point
of view diametrically opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p.
76]</span> to that of Hegel, owe their existence in the first
place to new ideas on the subject of the relative advantages and
disadvantages of war, which again were partly due to changes in the
character of war itself, partly to a new theory that the warfare
of the future should be a war of free competition for industrial
interests, or, in Herbert Spencer’s language, that the warlike type
of mankind should make room for an industrial type. This theory,
amounting in the minds of some thinkers to a fervid conviction,
and itself, in a sense, the source of what has been contemptuously
styled our British “shopkeeper’s policy” in Europe, was based on
something more solid than mere enthusiasm. The years of peace which
followed the downfall of Napoleon had brought immense increase in
material wealth to countries like France and Britain. Something of
the glamour had fallen away from the sword of the great Emperor. The
illusive excitement of a desire for conquest had died: the glory of
war had faded with it, but the burden still remained: its cost was
still there, something to be calmly reckoned up and not soon to be
forgotten. Europe was seen to be actually moving towards ruin. “We
shall have to get rid of war in all civilised countries,” said Louis
Philippe in 1843. “Soon no nation will be able to afford it.” War
was not only becoming more costly. New conditions had altered it in
other directions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>
With the development of technical science and its application to the
perfecting of methods and instruments of destruction every new war
was found to be bloodier than the last; and the day seemed to be in
sight, when this very development would make war (with instruments of
extermination) impossible altogether. The romance and picturesqueness
with which it was invested in the days of hand-to-hand combat was
gone. But, above all, war was now waged for questions fewer and more
important than in the time of Kant. Napoleon’s successful appeal
to the masses had suggested to Prussia the idea of consciously
nationalising the army. Our modern national wars exact a sacrifice,
necessarily much more heavy, much more reluctantly made than those
of the past which were fought with mercenary troops. Such wars have
not only greater dignity: they are more earnest, and their issue, as
in a sense the issue of conflict between higher and lower types of
civilisation, is speedier and more decisive.</p>
<p>In the hundred years since Kant’s death, much that he prophesied
has come to pass, although sometimes by different paths than he
anticipated. The strides made in recent years by commerce and
the growing power of the people in every state have had much of
the influence which he foretold. There is a greater reluctance
to wage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span> war.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_84" id="FNanchor_84">[84]</a>
But, unfortunately, as Professor Paulsen points out, the progress
of democracy and the nationalisation of war have not worked merely
in the direction of progress towards peace. War has now become
popular for the first time. “The progress of democracy in states,”
he says, (<i>Kant</i>, p. 364<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85" id="FNanchor_85">[85]</a>) “has not only not done away with war,
but has very greatly changed the feeling of people towards it. With
the universal military service, introduced by the Revolution, war
has become the people’s affair and popular, as it could not be in
the case of dynastic wars carried on with mercenary troops.” In the
people the love of peace is strong, but so too is the love of a
fight, the love of victory.</p>
<p>It is in the contemplation of facts and conflicting
tendencies like these that Peace Societies<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_86" id="FNanchor_86">[86]</a> have been formed.
The peace party is, we may say, an eclectic body: it embraces many
different sections of political opinion. There are those who hold,
for instance, that peace is to be established on a basis of communism
of property. There are others who insist on the establishment
throughout Europe of a republican form of government, or again, on
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> redistribution
of European territory in which Alsace-Lorraine is restored to
France—changes of which at least the last two would be difficult to
carry out, unless through international warfare. But these are not
the fundamental general principles of peace workers. The members
of this party agree in rejecting the principle of intervention, in
demanding a complete or partial disarmament of the nations of Europe,
and in requiring that all disputes between nations—and they admit the
prospects of dispute—should be settled by means of arbitration. In
how far are these principles useful or practicable?</p>
<p class="heading"><i>The Value of Arbitration.</i></p>
<p>There is a strong feeling in favour of arbitration on the part
of all classes of society. It is cheaper under all circumstances
than war. It is a judgment at once more certain and more complete,
excluding as far as possible the element of chance, leaving
irritation perhaps behind it, but none of the lasting bitterness
which is the legacy of every war. Arbitration has an important place
in all peace projects except that of Kant, whose federal union
would naturally fulfil the function of a tribunal of arbitration.
St. Pierre, Jeremy Bentham,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_87" id="FNanchor_87">[87]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p.
80]</span> Bluntschli<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_88" id="FNanchor_88">[88]</a> the German publicist, Professor Lorimer<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89" id="FNanchor_89">[89]</a>
and others among political writers,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90" id="FNanchor_90">[90]</a> and among rulers,
Louis Napoleon and the Emperor Alexander I. of Russia, have all made
proposals more or less ineffectual for the peaceful settlement of
international disputes. A number of cases have already been decided
by this means. But let us examine the questions which have been
at issue. Of a hundred and thirty matters of dispute settled by
arbitration since 1815 (cf. <i>International Tribunals</i>, published
by the Peace Society, 1899) it will be seen that all, with the
exception of one or two trifling cases of doubt as to the succession
to certain titles or principalities, can be classified roughly
under two heads—disputes as to the determination of boundaries or
the possession of certain territory, and questions of claims for
compensation and indemnities due either to individuals or states,
arising from the seizure of fleets or merchant vessels, the insult
or injury to private persons and so on—briefly, questions of money
or of territory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span>
These may fairly be said to be trifling causes, not touching
national honour or great political questions. That they should have
been settled in this way, however, shows a great advance. Smaller
causes than these have made some of the bloodiest wars in history.
That arbitration should have been the means of preventing even one
war which would otherwise have been waged is a strong reason why
we should fully examine its claims. “Quand l’institution d’une
haute cour,” writes Laveleye, (<i>Des causes actuelles de guerre en
Europe et de l’arbitrage</i>) “n’éviterait qu’une guerre sur vingt,
il vaudrait encore la peine de l’établir.” But history shows us
that there is no single instance of a supreme conflict having been
settled otherwise than by war. Arbitration is a method admirably
adapted to certain cases: to those we have named, where it has been
successfully applied, to the interpretation of contracts, to offences
against the Law of Nations—some writers say to trivial questions of
honour—in all cases where the use of armed force would be impossible,
as, for instance, in any quarrel in which neutralised countries<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_91" id="FNanchor_91">[91]</a>
like Belgium or Luxembourg should take a principal part, or in a
difference between two nations, such as (to take an extreme case) the
United States and Switzerland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p.
82]</span> which could not easily engage in actual combat. These
cases, which we cannot too carefully examine, show that what is here
essential is that it should be possible to formulate a juridical
statement of the conflicting claims. In Germany the <i>Bundestag</i> had
only power to decide questions of law. Other disputes were left to be
fought out. Questions on which the existence and vital honour of a
state depend—any question which nearly concerns the disputants—cannot
be reduced to any cut and dry legal formula of right and wrong.
We may pass over the consideration that in some cases (as in the
Franco-Prussian War) the delay caused by seeking mediation of any
kind would deprive a nation of the advantage its state of military
preparation deserved. And we may neglect the problem of finding an
impartial judge on some questions of dispute, although its solution
might be a matter of extreme difficulty, so closely are the interests
of modern nations bound up in one another. How could the Eastern
Question, for example, be settled by arbitration? It is impossible
that such a means should be sufficient for every case. Arbitration in
other words may prevent war, but can never be a substitute for war.
We cannot wonder that this is so. So numerous and conflicting are
the interests of states, so various are the grades of civilisation
to which they have attained and the directions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> along which they are developing, that
differences of the most vital kind are bound to occur and these can
never be settled by any peaceful means at present known to Europe.
This is above all true where the self-preservation<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92" id="FNanchor_92">[92]</a> or independence of
a people are concerned. Here the “good-will” of the nations who
disagree would necessarily be wanting: there could be no question of
the arbitration of an outsider.</p>
<p>But, indeed, looking away from questions so vital and on which
there can be little difference of opinion, we are apt to forget,
when we allow ourselves to talk extravagantly of the future of
arbitration, that every nation thinks, or at least pretends to think,
that it is in the right in every dispute in which it appears (cf.
Kant: <i>Perpetual Peace</i>, p. 120.): and, as a matter of history,
there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> has never
been a conflict between civilised states in which an appeal to this
“right” on the part of each has not been made. We talk glibly of
the right and wrong of this question or of that, of the justice of
this war, the iniquity of that. But what do these terms really mean?
<i>Do</i> we know, in spite of the labour which has been spent on this
question by the older publicists, which are the causes that justify
a war? Is it not true that the same war might be just in one set
of circumstances and unjust in another? Practically all writers on
this subject, exclusive of those who apply the biblical doctrine of
non-resistance, agree in admitting that a nation is justified in
defending its own existence or independence, that this is even a
moral duty as it is a fundamental right of a state. Many, especially
the older writers, make the confident assertion that all wars of
defence are just. But will this serve as a standard? Gibbon tells
us somewhere, that Livy asserts that the Romans conquered the world
in self-defence. The distinction between wars of aggression and
defence is one very difficult to draw. The cause of a nation which
waits to be actually attacked is often lost: the critical moment
in its defence may be past. The essence of a state’s defensive
power may lie in a readiness to strike the first blow, or its whole
interests may be bound up in the necessity of fighting the matter
out in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> enemy’s
country, rather than at home. It is not in the strictly military
interpretation of the term “defensive”, but in its wider ethical
and political sense that we can speak of wars of defence as just.
But, indeed, we cannot judge these questions abstractly. Where a
war is necessary, it matters very little whether it is just or not.
Only the judgment of history can finally decide; and generally it
seems at the time that both parties have something of right on
their side, something perhaps too of wrong.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_93" id="FNanchor_93">[93]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span></p> <p>A consideration
of difficulties like these brings us to a realisation of the fact
that the chances are small that a nation, in the heat of a dispute,
will admit the likelihood of its being in the wrong. To refuse
to admit this is generally tantamount to a refusal to submit the
difficulty to arbitration. And neither international law, nor the
moral force of public opinion can induce a state to act contrary to
what it believes to be its own interest. Moreover, as international
law now stands, it is not a duty to have recourse to arbitration.
This was made quite clear in the proceedings of the Peace Conference
at the Hague in 1899.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94" id="FNanchor_94">[94]</a> It was strongly recommended that
arbitration should be sought wherever it was possible, but, at the
same time definitely stated, that this course could in no case
be compulsory. In this respect things have not advanced beyond
the position of the Paris Congress of 1856.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_95" id="FNanchor_95">[95]</a> The wars waged in
Europe subsequent to that date, have all been begun without previous
attempt at mediation.</p>
<p>But the work of the peace party regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> humaner methods of
settlement is not to be neglected. The popular feeling which they
have been partly the means of stimulating has no doubt done something
to influence the action of statesmen towards extreme caution in
the treatment of questions likely to arouse national passions and
prejudices. Arbitration has undoubtedly made headway in recent
years. Britain and America, the two nations whose names naturally
suggest themselves to us as future centres of federative union, both
countries whose industrial interests are numerous and complicated,
have most readily, as they have most frequently, settled disputes
in this practical manner. It has shown itself to be a policy as
economical as it is business-like. Its value, in its proper place,
cannot be overrated by any Peace Congress or by any peace pamphlet;
but we have endeavoured to make it clear that this sphere is but a
limited one. The “good-will” may not be there when it ought perhaps
to appear: it will certainly not be there when any vital interest
is at stake. But, even if this were not so and arbitration were
the natural sequence of every dispute, no coercive force exists
to enforce the decree of the court. The moral restraint of public
opinion is here a poor substitute. Treaties, it is often said, are in
the same position; but treaties have been broken, and will no doubt
be broken again. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span>
are moved to the conclusion that a thoroughly logical peace programme
cannot stop short of the principle of federation. Federal troops are
necessary to carry out the decrees of a tribunal of arbitration, if
that court is not to run a risk of being held feeble and ineffectual.
Except on some such basis, arbitration, as a substitute for war,
stands on but a weak footing.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>Disarmament.</i></p>
<p>The efforts of the Peace Society are directed with even less hope
of complete success against another evil of our time, the crushing
burden of modern armaments. We have peace at this moment, but at
a daily increasing cost. The Peace Society is rightly concerned
in pressing this point. It is not enough to keep off actual war:
there is a limit to the price we can afford to pay even for peace.
Probably no principle has cost Europe so much in the last century
as that handed down from Rome:—“Si vis pacem, para bellum.” It is
now a hundred and fifty years since Montesquieu<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96" id="FNanchor_96">[96]</a> protested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span> against this “new
distemper” which was spreading itself over Europe; but never, in
time of peace, has complaint been so loud or so general as now:
and this, not only against the universal burden of taxation which
weighs upon all nations alike, but, in continental countries,
against the waste of productive force due to compulsory military
service, a discontent which seems to strike at the very foundations
of society. Vattel relates that in early times a treaty of peace
generally stipulated that both parties should afterwards disarm. And
there is no doubt that Kant was right in regarding standing armies
as a danger to peace, not only as openly expressing the rivalry and
distrust between nation and nation which Hobbes regards as the basis
of international relations, but also as putting a power into the
hand of a nation which it may some day have the temptation to abuse.
A war-loving, overbearing spirit in a people thrives none the worse
for a consciousness that its army or navy can hold its own with any
other in Europe. Were it not the case that the essence of armed peace
is that a high state of efficiency should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> general, the danger to peace would be
very great indeed. No doubt it is due to this fact that France has
kept quietly to her side of the Rhine during the last thirty years.
The annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was an immediate stimulus to the
increase of armaments; but otherwise, just because of this greater
efficiency and the slightly stronger military position of Germany, it
has been an influence on the side of peace.</p>
<p>The Czar’s Rescript of 1898 gave a new stimulus to an interest
in this question which the subsequent conference at the Hague was
unable fully to satisfy. We are compelled to consider carefully
how a process of simultaneous disarmament can actually be carried
out, and what results might be anticipated from this step, with a
view not only to the present but the future. Can this be done in
accordance with the principles of justice? Organisations like a
great navy or a highly disciplined army have been built up, in the
course of centuries, at great cost and at much sacrifice to the
nation. They are the fruit of years of wise government and a high
record of national industry. Are such visible tokens of the culture
and character and worth of a people to be swept away and Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey to stand on the same level?
And, even if no such ethical considerations should arise, on what
method are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> we to
proceed? The standard as well as the nature of armament depends
in every state on its geographical conditions and its historical
position. An ocean-bound empire like Britain is comparatively immune
from the danger of invasion: her army can be safely despatched to
the colonies, her fleet protects her at home, her position is one of
natural defence. But Germany and Austria find themselves in exactly
opposite circumstances, with the hard necessity imposed upon them of
guarding their frontiers on every side. The safety of a nation like
Germany is in the hands of its army: its military strength lies in an
almost perfect mastery of the science of attack.</p>
<p>The Peace Society has hitherto made no attempt to face the
difficulties inseparable from any attempt to apply a uniform method
of treatment to peculiarities and conditions so conflicting and
various as these. Those who have been more conscientious have not
been very successful in solving them. Indeed, so constantly is
military technique changing that it is difficult to prophesy wherein
will lie, a few years hence, the essence of a state’s defensive
power or what part the modern navy will play in this defence. No
careful thinker would suggest, in the face of dangers threatening
from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> East,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97" id="FNanchor_97">[97]</a> a
complete disarmament. The simplest of many suggestions made—but
this on the basis of universal conscription—seems to be that the
number of years or months of compulsory military service should
be reduced to some fixed period. But this does not touch the
difficulty of colonial empires<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_98" id="FNanchor_98">[98]</a> like Britain which might to a certain
extent disarm, like their neighbours, in Europe, but would be
compelled to keep an army for the defence of their colonies
elsewhere. It is, in the meantime, inevitable that Europe should keep
up a high standard of armament—this is, (and even if we had European
federation, would remain) an absolute necessity as a protection
against the yellow races, and in Europe itself there are at present
elements hostile to the cause of peace. Alsace-Lorraine, Polish
Prussia, Russian Poland and Finland are still, to a considerable
degree, sources of discontent and dissatisfaction. But in Russia
itself lies the great obstacle to a future European peace or
European federation: we can scarcely picture Russia as a reliable
member of such a union. That Russia should disarm is scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> feasible, in view of its
own interest: it has always to face the danger of rebellion in Poland
and anarchy at home. But that Europe should disarm, before Russia has
attained a higher civilisation, a consciousness of its great future
as a north-eastern, inter-oceanic empire, and a government more
favourable to the diffusion of liberty, is still less practicable.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_99" id="FNanchor_99">[99]</a> We
have here to fall back upon federation again. It is not impossible
that, in the course of time, this problem may be solved and that
the contribution to the federal troops of a European union may be
regulated upon some equitable basis the form of which we cannot now
well prophesy.</p>
<p>European federation would likewise meet all difficulties where a
risk might be likely to occur of one nation intervening to protect
another. As we have said (above, <a href="#Footnote_69" class="pginternal">p. 64,
<i>note</i></a>) nations are now-a-days slow to intervene in the interests
of humanity: they are in general constrained to do so only by strong
motives of self-interest, and when these are not at hand they are
said to refrain from respect for another’s right of independent
action. Actually a state which is actuated by less selfish impulses
is apt to lose considerably more than it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span> gains, and the feeling of the people
expresses itself strongly against any quixotic or sentimental policy.
It is not impossible that the Powers may have yet to intervene to
protect Turkey against Russia. Such a step might well be dictated
purely by a proper care for the security of Europe; but wars of this
kind seem not likely to play an important part in the near future.</p>
<p>We have said that the causes of difference which may be expected
to disturb the peace of Europe are now fewer. A modern sovereign
no longer spends his leisure time in the excitement of slaying or
seeing slain. He could not, if he would. His honour and his vanity
are protected by other means: they play no longer an important part
in the affairs of nations. The causes of war can no more be either
trifling or personal. Some crises there are, which are ever likely to
be fatal to peace. There present themselves, in the lives of nations,
ideal ends for which everything must be sacrificed: there are rights
which must at all cost be defended. The question of civil war we
may neglect: liberty and wise government are the only medicine for
social discontent, and much may be hoped from that in the future.
But now, looking beyond the state to the great family of civilised
nations, we may say that the one certain cause of war between them
or of rebellion within a future federated union will be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span> menace to the sovereign
rights, the independence and existence of any member of that
federation. Other causes of quarrel offer a more hopeful prospect.
Some questions have been seen to be specially fitted for the legal
procedure of a tribunal of arbitration, others to be such as a
federal court would quickly settle. The preservation of the balance
of power which Frederick the Great regarded as the talisman of peace
in Europe—a judgment surely not borne out by experience—is happily
one of the causes of war which are of the past. Wars of colonisation,
such as would be an attempt on the part of Russia to conquer India,
seem scarcely likely to recur except between higher and lower races.
The cost is now-a-days too great. Political wars, wars for national
union and unity, of which there were so many during the past century,
seem at present not to be near at hand; and the integration of
European nations—what may be called the great mission of war—is, for
the moment, practically complete; for it is highly improbable that
either Alsace-Lorraine or Poland—still less Finland—will be the cause
of a war of this kind.</p>
<p>Our hope lies in a federated Europe. Its troops would serve to
preserve law and order in the country from which they were drawn and
to protect its colonies abroad; but their higher function would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span> be to keep peace in
Europe, to protect the weaker members of the Federation and to
enforce the decision of the majority, either, if necessary, by actual
war, or by the mere threatening demonstrations of fleets, such as
have before proved effectual.</p>
<p>We have carefully considered what has been attempted by peace
workers, and we have now to take note that all the results of the
last fifty years are not to be attributed to their conscientious
but often ill-directed labour. The diminution of the causes of war
is to be traced less to the efforts of the Peace Society, (except
indirectly, in so far as they have influenced the minds of the
masses) than to the increasing power of the people themselves.
The various classes of society are opposed to violent methods of
settlement, not in the main from a conviction as to the wrongfulness
of war or from any fanatical enthusiasm for a brotherhood of
nations, but from self-interest. War is death to the industrial
interests of a nation. It is vain to talk, in the language of past
centuries, of trade between civilised countries being advanced and
markets opened up or enlarged by this means.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100" id="FNanchor_100">[100]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span> Kings give up the dream of military glory
and accept instead the certainty of peaceful labour and industrial
progress, and all this (for we may believe that to some monarchs it
is much) from no enthusiastic appreciation of the efforts of Peace
Societies, from no careful examination of the New Testament nor
inspired interpretation of its teaching. It is self-interest, the
prosperity of the country—patriotism, if you will—that seems better
than war.</p>
<p class="heading"><i>What may be expected from Federation.</i></p>
<p>Federation and federation alone can help out the programme of the
Peace Society. It cannot be pretended that it will do everything.
To state the worst at once, it will not prevent war. Even the
federations of the states of Germany and America, bound together by
ties of blood and language and, in the latter case, of sentiment,
were not strong enough within to keep out dissension and disunion.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101" id="FNanchor_101">[101]</a>
Wars would not cease, but they would become much less frequent.
“Why is there no longer war between England and Scotland? Why did
Prussian and Hanoverian fight side by side in 1870, though they had
fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> against
each other only four years before?... If we wish to know how war is
to cease, we should ask ourselves how it <i>has</i> ceased” (Professor
D. G. Ritchie, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 169). Wars between different grades
of civilisation are bound to exist as long as civilisation itself
exists. The history of culture and of progress has been more or less
a history of war. A calm acceptance of this position may mean to
certain short-sighted, enthusiastic theorists an impossible sacrifice
of the ideal; but, the sacrifice once made, we stand on a better
footing with regard to at least one class of arguments against a
federation of the world. Such a union will lead, it is said, to an
equality in culture, a sameness of interests fatal to progress;
all struggle and conflict will be cast out of the state itself;
national characteristics and individuality will be obliterated;
the lamb and the wolf will lie down together: stagnation will
result, intellectual progress will be at an end, politics will be
no more, history will stand still. This is a sweeping assertion, an
alarming prophecy. But a little thought will assure us that there
is small cause for apprehension. There can be no such standstill,
no millennium in human affairs. A gradual smoothing down of sharply
accentuated national characteristics there might be: this is a result
which a freer, more friendly intercourse between nations would be
very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span> likely to
produce. But conflicting interests, keen rivalry in their pursuit,
difference of culture and natural aptitude, and all or much of
the individuality which language and literature, historical and
religious traditions, even climatic and physical conditions produce
are bound to survive until the coming of some more overwhelming and
far-spreading revolution than this. It would not be well if it were
otherwise, if those “unconscious and invisible peculiarities” in
which Fichte sees the hand of God and the guarantee of a nation’s
future dignity, virtue and merit should be swept away. (<i>Reden an
die deutsche Nation</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102" id="FNanchor_102">[102]</a> 1807.) Nor is stagnation to be feared.
“Strife,” said the old philosopher, “is the father of all things.”
There can be no lasting peace in the processes of nature and
existence. It has been in the constant rivalry between classes within
themselves, and in the struggle for existence with other races that
great nations have reached the highwater mark of their development.
A perpetual peace in international relations we may—nay, surely
will—one day have, but eternity will not see the end to the feverish
unrest within the state and the jealous competition and distrust
between individuals, groups and classes of society. Here there must
ever be perpetual war.</p>
<p>It was only of this political peace between civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>ised nations
that Kant thought.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103" id="FNanchor_103">[103]</a> In this form it is bound to come. The
federation of Europe will follow the federation of Germany and
of Italy, not only because it offers a solution of many problems
which have long taxed Europe, but because great men and careful
thinkers believe in it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104" id="FNanchor_104">[104]</a> It may not come quickly, but such men can
afford to wait. “If I were legislator,” cried Jean Jacques Rousseau,
“I should not say what ought to be done, but I would do it.” This is
the attitude of the unthinking, unpractical enthusiast. The wish is
not enough: the will is not enough. The mills of God must take their
own time: no hope or faith of ours, no struggle or labour even can
hurry them.</p>
<p>It is a misfortune that the Peace Society has identified
itself with so narrow and uncritical an attitude towards war,
and that the copious elo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p.
101]</span>quence of its members is not based upon a consideration
of the practical difficulties of the case. This well-meaning, hard
working and enthusiastic body would like to do what is impossible
by an impossible method. The end which it sets for itself is an
unattainable one. But this need not be so. To make unjustifiable
aggression difficult, to banish unworthy pretexts for making war
might be a high enough ideal for any enthusiasm and offer scope wide
enough for the labours of any society. But the Peace Society has not
contented itself with this great work. Through its over-estimation
of the value of peace,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105" id="FNanchor_105">[105]</a> its cause has been injured and much of
its influence has been weakened or lost. Our age is one which sets
a high value upon human life; and to this change of thinking may be
traced our modern reform in the methods of war and all that has been
done for the alleviation of suffering by the great Conventions of
recent years. For the eyes of most people war is merely a hideous
spectacle of bloodshed and deliberate destruction of life: this is
its obvious side. But it is possible to exaggerate this confessedly
great evil. Peace has its sacrifices as well as war: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span> progress of humanity
requires that the individual should often be put aside for the sake
of lasting advantage to the whole. An opposite view can only be
reckoned individualistic, perhaps materialistic. “The reverence for
human life,” says Martineau, (<i>Studies of Christianity</i>, pp. 352,
354) “is carried to an immoral idolatry, when it is held more sacred
than justice and right, and when the spectacle of blood becomes
more horrible than the sight of desolating tyrannies and triumphant
hypocrisies.... We have, therefore, no more doubt that a war may be
right, than that a policeman may be a security for justice, and we
object to a fortress as little as to a handcuff.”</p>
<p>The Peace Society are not of this opinion: they greatly doubt that
a war may be right, and they rarely fail to take their doubts to the
tribunal of Scripture. Their efforts are well meant, this piety may
be genuine enough; but a text is rarely a proof of anything, and in
any case serves one man in as good stead as another. We remember that
“the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.” This unscientific
method of proof or persuasion has ever been widely popular. It is
a serious examination of the question that we want, a more careful
study of its actual history and of the possibilities of human nature;
less vague, exaggerated language about what ought to be done, and a
realisation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>
what has been actually achieved; above all, a clear perception of
what may fairly be asked from the future.</p>
<p>It used to be said—is perhaps asserted still by the
war-lovers—that there was no path to civilisation which had not
been beaten by the force of arms, no height to which the sword
had not led the way. The inspiration of war was upon the great
arts of civilisation: its hand was upon the greatest of the
sciences. These obligations extended even to commerce. War not
only created new branches of industry, it opened new markets and
enlarged the old. These are great claims, according to which
war might be called the moving principle of history. If we keep
our eyes fixed upon the history of the past, they seem not only
plausible: they are in a great sense true. Progress did tread at
the heels of the great Alexander’s army: the advance of European
culture stands in the closest connection with the Crusades. But
was this happy compensation for a miserable state of affairs not
due to the peculiarly unsocial conditions of early times and the
absence of every facility for the interchange of ideas or material
advantages? It is inconceivable that now-a-days<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_106" id="FNanchor_106">[106]</a> any aid to the
development of thought in Europe should come from war. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> old adage, in more than
a literal sense, has but too often been proved true:—“Inter arma,
Musae silent.” Peace is for us the real promoter of culture.</p>
<p>We have to endeavour to take an intermediate course between
uncritical praise and wholesale condemnation, between extravagant
expectation and unjustifiable pessimism. War used to be the rule: it
is now an overwhelming and terrible exception—an interruption to the
peaceful prosperous course of things, inflicting unlimited suffering
and temporary or lasting loss. Its evils are on the surface, apparent
to the most unthinking observer. The day may yet dawn, when Europeans
will have learned to regard the force of arms as an instrument for
the civilisation of savage or half-savage races, and war within
their continent as civil war, necessary and justifiable sometimes
perhaps, but still a blot upon their civilisation and brotherhood
as men. Such a suggestion rings strangely. But the great changes,
which the roll of centuries has marked, once came upon the world not
less unexpectedly. How far off must the idea of a civil peace have
seemed to small towns and states of Europe in the fifteenth century!
How strange, only a century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p.
105]</span> ago, would the idea of applying steam power or electrical
force have seemed to ourselves! Let us not despair. War has played a
great part in the history of the world: it has been ever the great
architect of nations, the true mother of cities. It has justified
itself to-day in the union of kindred peoples, the making of great
empires. It may be that one decisive war may yet be required to unite
Europe. May Europe survive that struggle and go forward fearlessly to
her great future! A peaceful future that may not be. It must never
be forgotten that war is sometimes a moral duty, that it is ever the
natural sequence of human passion and human prejudice. An unbroken
peace we cannot and do not expect; but it is this that we must work
for. As Kant says, we must keep it before us as an ideal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> need not try to decide whether this
satirical inscription, (once found on a Dutch innkeeper’s sign-board
above the picture of a churchyard) is aimed at mankind in general, or
at the rulers of states in particular, unwearying in their love of
war, or perhaps only at the philosophers who cherish the sweet dream
of perpetual peace. The author of the present sketch would make one
stipulation, however. The practical politician stands upon a definite
footing with the theorist: with great self-complacency he looks down
upon him as a mere pedant whose empty ideas can threaten no danger
to the state (starting as it does from principles derived from
experience), and who may always be permitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span> knock down his eleven skittles at once
without a worldly-wise statesman needing to disturb himself. Hence,
in the event of a quarrel arising between the two, the practical
statesman must always act consistently, and not scent danger to the
state behind opinions ventured by the theoretical politician at
random and publicly expressed. With which saving clause (<i>clausula
salvatoria</i>) the author will herewith consider himself duly and
expressly protected against all malicious misinterpretation.</p>
<h3 title="FIRST SECTION CONTAINING THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES OF PERPETUAL PEACE BETWEEN STATES"> <i>FIRST SECTION</i></h3>
<p class="subh3">CONTAINING THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES OF PERPETUAL
PEACE BETWEEN STATES</p>
<p>1.—“No treaty of peace shall be regarded as
valid, if made with the secret reservation of material
for a future war.”</p>
<p class="p1">For then it would be a mere truce, a mere suspension
of hostilities, not peace. A peace signifies the end of all
hostilities and to attach to it the epithet “eternal” is not
only a verbal pleonasm, but matter of suspicion. The causes of a
future war existing, although perhaps not yet known to the high
contracting parties themselves, are entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span> annihilated by the conclusion of
peace, however acutely they may be ferreted out of documents in the
public archives. There may be a mental reservation of old claims to
be thought out at a future time, which are, none of them, mentioned
at this stage, because both parties are too much exhausted to
continue the war, while the evil intention remains of using the
first favourable opportunity for further hostilities. Diplomacy
of this kind only Jesuitical casuistry can justify: it is beneath
the dignity of a ruler, just as acquiescence in such processes of
reasoning is beneath the dignity of his minister, if one judges the
facts as they really are.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109" id="FNanchor_109">[109]</a></p>
<p>If, however, according to present enlightened ideas of political
wisdom, the true glory of a state lies in the uninterrupted
development of its power by every possible means, this judgment must
certainly strike one as scholastic and pedantic.</p>
<p class="p2">2.—“No state having an independent existence—whether
it be great or small—shall be acquired by another through
inheritance, exchange, purchase or donation.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_110" id="FNanchor_110">[110]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span></p>
<p class="p1">For a state is not a property (<i>patrimonium</i>), as may
be the ground on which its people are settled. It is a society of
human beings over whom no one but itself has the right to rule and
to dispose. Like the trunk of a tree, it has its own roots, and to
graft it on to another state is to do away with its existence as a
moral person, and to make of it a thing. Hence it is in contradiction
to the idea of the original contract without which no right over
a people is thinkable.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_111" id="FNanchor_111">[111]</a> Everyone knows to what danger the bias in
favour of these modes of acquisition has brought Europe (in other
parts of the world it has never been known). The custom of marriage
between states, as if they were individuals, has survived even up
to the most recent times,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_112" id="FNanchor_112">[112]</a> and is regarded partly as a new kind
of industry by which ascendency may be acquired through family
alliances, without any expenditure of strength; partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span> as a device for
territorial expansion. Moreover, the hiring out of the troops of one
state to another to fight against an enemy not at war with their
native country is to be reckoned in this connection; for the subjects
are in this way used and abused at will as personal property.</p>
<p class="p2">3.—“Standing armies (<i>miles perpetuus</i>) shall be
abolished in course of time.”</p>
<p class="p1">For they are always threatening other states with
war by appearing to be in constant readiness to fight. They incite
the various states to outrival one another in the number of their
soldiers, and to this number no limit can be set. Now, since owing
to the sums devoted to this purpose, peace at last becomes even more
oppressive than a short war, these standing armies are themselves the
cause of wars of aggression, undertaken in order to get rid of this
burden. To which we must add that the practice of hiring men to kill
or to be killed seems to imply a use of them as mere machines and
instruments in the hand of another (namely, the state) which cannot
easily be reconciled with the right of humanity in our own person.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_113" id="FNanchor_113">[113]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span> matter stands
quite differently in the case of voluntary periodical military
exercise on the part of citizens of the state, who thereby seek to
secure themselves and their country against attack from without.</p>
<p>The accumulation of treasure in a state would in the same way be
regarded by other states as a menace of war, and might compel them to
anticipate this by striking the first blow. For of the three forces,
the power of arms, the power of alliance and the power of money, the
last might well become the most reliable instrument of war, did not
the difficulty of ascertaining the amount stand in the way.</p>
<p class="p2">4.—“No national debts shall be contracted in connection
with the external affairs of the state.”</p>
<p class="p1">This source of help is above suspicion, where
assistance is sought outside or within the state, on behalf of the
economic administration of the country (for instance, the improvement
of the roads, the settlement and support of new colonies, the
establishment of granaries to provide against seasons of scarcity,
and so on). But, as a common weapon used by the Powers against
one another, a credit system under which debts go on indefinitely
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span>creasing and
are yet always assured against immediate claims (because all the
creditors do not put in their claim at once) is a dangerous money
power. This ingenious invention of a commercial people in the
present century is, in other words, a treasure for the carrying on
of war which may exceed the treasures of all the other states taken
together, and can only be exhausted by a threatening deficiency in
the taxes—an event, however, which will long be kept off by the very
briskness of commerce resulting from the reaction of this system on
industry and trade. The ease, then, with which war may be waged,
coupled with the inclination of rulers towards it—an inclination
which seems to be implanted in human nature—is a great obstacle in
the way of perpetual peace. The prohibition of this system must be
laid down as a preliminary article of perpetual peace, all the more
necessarily because the final inevitable bankruptcy of the state in
question must involve in the loss many who are innocent; and this
would be a public injury to these states. Therefore other nations are
at least justified in uniting themselves against such an one and its
pretensions.</p>
<p class="p2">5.—“No state shall violently interfere with the
constitution and administration of another.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span>For
what can justify it in so doing? The scandal which is here presented
to the subjects of another state? The erring state can much more
serve as a warning by exemplifying the great evils which a nation
draws down on itself through its own lawlessness. Moreover, the
bad example which one free person gives another, (as <i>scandalum
acceptum</i>) does no injury to the latter. In this connection, it is
true, we cannot count the case of a state which has become split up
through internal corruption into two parts, each of them representing
by itself an individual state which lays claim to the whole. Here
the yielding of assistance to one faction could not be reckoned as
interference on the part of a foreign state with the constitution of
another, for here anarchy prevails. So long, however, as the inner
strife has not yet reached this stage the interference of other
powers would be a violation of the rights of an independent nation
which is only struggling with internal disease.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_114" id="FNanchor_114">[114]</a> It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> therefore itself cause
a scandal, and make the autonomy of all states insecure.</p>
<p class="p2">6.—“No state at war with another shall countenance
such modes of hostility as would make mutual confidence impossible
in a subsequent state of peace: such are the employment of
assassins (<i>percussores</i>) or of poisoners (<i>venefici</i>), breaches
of capitulation, the instigating and making use of treachery
(<i>perduellio</i>) in the hostile state.”</p>
<p class="p1">These are dishonourable stratagems. For some kind
of confidence in the disposition of the enemy must exist even in
the midst of war, as otherwise peace could not be concluded, and
the hostilities would pass into a war of extermination (<i>bellum
internecinum</i>). War, however, is only our wretched expedient of
asserting a right by force, an expedient adopted in the state of
nature, where no court of justice exists which could settle the
matter in dispute. In circumstances like these, neither of the two
parties can be called an unjust enemy, because this form of speech
presupposes a legal decision: the issue of the conflict—just as in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> case of the
so-called judgments of God—decides on which side right is. Between
states, however, no punitive war (<i>bellum punitivum</i>) is thinkable,
because between them a relation of superior and inferior does not
exist. Whence it follows that a war of extermination, where the
process of annihilation would strike both parties at once and all
right as well, would bring about perpetual peace only in the great
graveyard of the human race. Such a war then, and therefore also the
use of all means which lead to it, must be absolutely forbidden.
That the methods just mentioned do inevitably lead to this result
is obvious from the fact that these infernal arts, already vile in
themselves, on coming into use, are not long confined to the sphere
of war. Take, for example, the use of spies (<i>uti exploratoribus</i>).
Here only the dishonesty of others is made use of; but vices such
as these, when once encouraged, cannot in the nature of things be
stamped out and would be carried over into the state of peace, where
their presence would be utterly destructive to the purpose of that
state.</p>
<p>Although the laws stated are, objectively regarded, (<i>i.e.</i> in
so far as they affect the action of rulers) purely prohibitive laws
(<i>leges prohibitivæ</i>), some of them (<i>leges strictæ</i>) are strictly
valid without regard to circumstances and urgently require to be
enforced. Such are Nos. 1, 5, 6. Others, again, (like Nos. 2,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> 3, 4) although not
indeed exceptions to the maxims of law, yet in respect of the
practical application of these maxims allow subjectively of a certain
latitude to suit particular circumstances. The enforcement of these
<i>leges latæ</i> may be legitimately put off, so long as we do not lose
sight of the ends at which they aim. This purpose of reform does not
permit of the deferment of an act of restitution (as, for example,
the restoration to certain states of freedom of which they have been
deprived in the manner described in article 2) to an infinitely
distant date—as Augustus used to say, to the “Greek Kalends”, a day
that will never come. This would be to sanction non-restitution.
Delay is permitted only with the intention that restitution should
not be made too precipitately and so defeat the purpose we have
in view. For the prohibition refers here only to the <i>mode of
acquisition</i> which is to be no longer valid, and not to the <i>fact of
possession</i> which, although indeed it has not the necessary title
of right, yet at the time of so-called acquisition was held legal
by all states, in accordance with the public opinion of the time.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_115" id="FNanchor_115">[115]</a></p>

<p>A state of peace among men who live side by side is not the
natural state (<i>status naturalis</i>), which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span> is rather to be described as
a state of war:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_116" id="FNanchor_116">[116]</a> that is to say, although there is not

<p class="centra p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p.
120]</span><small>FIRST DEFINITIVE ARTICLE OF PERPETUAL
PEACE</small></p>
<p class="centra p1">I.—“The civil constitution of each state shall be
republican.”</p>
<p class="p1">The only constitution which has its origin in the
idea of the original contract, upon which the lawful legislation of
every nation must be based, is the republican.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_119" id="FNanchor_119">[119]</a> It is a constitution,
in the first place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p.
121]</span> founded in accordance with the principle of the freedom
of the members of society as human beings: secondly, in accordance
with the principle of the dependence of all, as subjects, on a common
legislation: and, thirdly, in accordance with the law of the equality
of the members as citizens. It is then, looking at the question of
right, the only constitution whose fundamental principles lie at the
basis of every form of civil constitution. And the only question for
us now is, whether it is also the one constitution which can lead to
perpetual peace.</p>
<p>Now the republican constitution apart from the soundness
of its origin, since it arose from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> pure source of the concept of right,
has also the prospect of attaining the desired result, namely,
perpetual peace. And the reason is this. If, as must be so under this
constitution, the consent of the subjects is required to determine
whether there shall be war or not, nothing is more natural than that
they should weigh the matter well, before undertaking such a bad
business. For in decreeing war, they would of necessity be resolving
to bring down the miseries of war upon their country. This implies:
they must fight themselves; they must hand over the costs of the war
out of their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
property; they must do their poor best to make good the devastation
which it leaves behind; and finally, as a crowning ill, they have
to accept a burden of debt which will embitter even peace itself,
and which they can never pay off on account of the new wars which
are always impending. On the other hand, in a government where the
subject is not a citizen holding a vote, (<i>i.e.</i> in a constitution
which is not republican), the plunging into war is the least serious
thing in the world. For the ruler is not a citizen, but the owner
of the state, and does not lose a whit by the war, while he goes
on enjoying the delights of his table or sport, or of his pleasure
palaces and gala days. He can therefore decide on war for the
most trifling reasons, as if it were a kind of pleasure party.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_120" id="FNanchor_120">[120]</a> Any
justification of it that is necessary for the sake of decency he can
leave without concern to the diplomatic corps who are always only too
ready with their services.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span>*   *   *</p>
<p>The following remarks must be made in order that we may not fall
into the common error of confusing the republican with the democratic
constitution. The forms of the state (<i>civitas</i>)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_121" id="FNanchor_121">[121]</a> may be classified
according to either of two principles of division:—the difference
of the persons who hold the supreme authority in the state, and the
manner in which the people are governed by their ruler whoever he
may be. The first is properly called the form of sovereignty (<i>forma
imperii</i>), and there can be only three constitutions differing
in this respect: where, namely, the supreme authority belongs to
only one, to several individuals working together, or to the whole
people constituting the civil society. Thus we have autocracy
or the sovereignty of a monarch, aristocracy or the sovereignty
of the nobility, and democracy or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> sovereignty of the people. The
second principle of division is the form of government (<i>forma
regiminis</i>), and refers to the way in which the state makes use of
its supreme power: for the manner of government is based on the
constitution, itself the act of that universal will which transforms
a multitude into a nation. In this respect the form of government
is either republican or despotic. Republicanism is the political
principle of severing the executive power of the government from the
legislature. Despotism is that principle in pursuance of which the
state arbitrarily puts into effect laws which it has itself made:
consequently it is the administration of the public will, but this is
identical with the private will of the ruler. Of these three forms of
a state, democracy, in the proper sense of the word, is of necessity
despotism, because it establishes an executive power, since all
decree regarding—and, if need be, against—any individual who dissents
from them. Therefore the “whole people”, so-called, who carry their
measure are really not all, but only a majority: so that here the
universal will is in contradiction with itself and with the principle
of freedom.</p>
<p>Every form of government in fact which is not representative
is really no true constitution at all, because a law-giver may
no more be, in one and the same person, the administrator of his
own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span> will, than
the universal major premise of a syllogism may be, at the same time,
the subsumption under itself of the particulars contained in the
minor premise. And, although the other two constitutions, autocracy
and aristocracy, are always defective in so far as they leave the
way open for such a form of government, yet there is at least
always a possibility in these cases, that they may take the form
of a government in accordance with the spirit of a representative
system. Thus Frederick the Great used at least to <i>say</i> that he
was “merely the highest servant of the state.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_122" id="FNanchor_122">[122]</a> The democratic
constitution, on the other hand, makes this impossible, because
under such a government every one wishes to be master. We may
therefore say that the smaller the staff of the executive—that
is to say, the number of rulers—and the more real, on the other
hand, their representation of the people, so much the more is the
government of the state in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p.
127]</span> accordance with a possible republicanism; and it may
hope by gradual reforms to raise itself to that standard. For this
reason, it is more difficult under an aristocracy than under a
monarchy—while under a democracy it is impossible except by a violent
revolution—to attain to this, the one perfectly lawful constitution.
The kind of government,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_123" id="FNanchor_123">[123]</a> however, is of infinitely more importance
to the people than the kind of constitution, although the greater or
less aptitude of a people for this ideal greatly depends upon such
external form. The form of government, however, if it is to be in
accordance with the idea of right, must embody the representative
system in which alone a republican form of administration is
pos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span>sible and
without which it is despotic and violent, be the constitution what
it may. None of the ancient so-called republics were aware of
this, and they necessarily slipped into absolute despotism which,
of all despotisms, is most endurable under the sovereignty of one
individual.</p>
<p class="centra p2"><small>SECOND DEFINITIVE ARTICLE OF PERPETUAL
PEACE</small></p>
<p class="centra p1">II.—“The law of nations shall be founded on a
federation of free states.”</p>
<p class="p1">Nations, as states, may be judged like individuals who,
living in the natural state of society—that is to say, uncontrolled
by external law—injure one another through their very proximity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_124" id="FNanchor_124">[124]</a>
Every state, for the sake of its own security, may—and ought
to—demand that its neighbour should submit itself to conditions,
similar to those of the civil society where the right of every
individual is guaranteed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p.
129]</span> This would give rise to a federation of nations which,
however, would not have to be a State of nations.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_125" id="FNanchor_125">[125]</a> That would involve
a contradiction. For the term “state” implies the relation of one
who rules to those who obey—that is to say, of law-giver to the
subject people: and many nations in one state would constitute only
one nation, which contradicts our hypothesis, since here we have to
consider the right of one nation against another, in so far as they
are so many separate states and are not to be fused into one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>The attachment
of savages to their lawless liberty, the fact that they would rather
be at hopeless variance with one another than submit themselves to a
legal authority constituted by themselves, that they therefore prefer
their senseless freedom to a reason-governed liberty, is regarded by
us with profound contempt as barbarism and uncivilisation and the
brutal degradation of humanity. So one would think that civilised
races, each formed into a state by itself, must come out of such an
abandoned condition as soon as they possibly can. On the contrary,
however, every state thinks rather that its majesty (the “majesty”
of a people is an absurd expression) lies just in the very fact that
it is subject to no external legal authority; and the glory of the
ruler consists in this, that, without his requiring to expose himself
to danger, thousands stand at his command ready to let themselves be
sacrificed for a matter of no concern to them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_126" id="FNanchor_126">[126]</a> The difference
between the savages of Europe and those of America lies chiefly
in this, that, while many tribes of the latter have been entirely
devoured by their enemies, Europeans know a better way of using the
vanquished than by eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p.
131]</span> them; and they prefer to increase through them the number
of their subjects, and so the number of instruments at their command
for still more widely spread war.</p>
<p>The depravity of human nature<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_127" id="FNanchor_127">[127]</a> shows itself without
disguise in the unrestrained relations of nations to each other,
while in the law-governed civil state much of this is hidden by
the check of government. This being so, it is astonishing that the
word “right” has not yet been entirely banished from the politics
of war as pedantic, and that no state has yet ventured to publicly
advocate this point of view. For Hugo Grotius, Puffendorf, Vattel
and others—Job’s comforters, all of them—are always quoted in good
faith to justify an attack, although their codes, whether couched
in philosophical or diplomatic terms, have not—nor can have—the
slightest legal force, because states, as such, are under no common
external authority; and there is no instance of a state having
ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span> been moved
by argument to desist from its purpose, even when this was backed
up by the testimony of such great men. This homage which every
state renders—in words at least—to the idea of right, proves that,
although it may be slumbering, there is, notwithstanding, to be found
in man a still higher natural moral capacity by the aid of which
he will in time gain the mastery over the evil principle in his
nature, the existence of which he is unable to deny. And he hopes
the same of others; for otherwise the word “right” would never be
uttered by states who wish to wage war, unless to deride it like
the Gallic Prince who declared:—“The privilege which nature gives
the strong is that the weak must obey them.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_128" id="FNanchor_128">[128]</a></p>
<p>The method by which states prosecute their rights can never be
by process of law—as it is where there is an external tribunal—but
only by war. Through this means, however, and its favourable issue,
victory, the question of right is never decided. A treaty of peace
makes, it may be, an end to the war of the moment, but not to the
conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span> of war
which at any time may afford a new pretext for opening hostilities;
and this we cannot exactly condemn as unjust, because under these
conditions everyone is his own judge. Notwithstanding, not quite
the same rule applies to states according to the law of nations
as holds good of individuals in a lawless condition according to
the law of nature, namely, “that they ought to advance out of this
condition.” This is so, because, as states, they have already
within themselves a legal constitution, and have therefore advanced
beyond the stage at which others, in accordance with their ideas
of right, can force them to come under a wider legal constitution.
Meanwhile, however, reason, from her throne of the supreme
law-giving moral power, absolutely condemns war<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_129" id="FNanchor_129">[129]</a> as a morally lawful
proceeding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span>
and makes a state of peace, on the other hand, an immediate duty.
Without a compact between the nations, however, this state of peace
cannot be established or assured. Hence there must be an alliance
of a particular kind which we may call a covenant of peace (<i>foedus
pacificum</i>), which would differ from a treaty of peace (<i>pactum
pacis</i>) in this respect, that the latter merely puts an end to one
war, while the former would seek to put an end to war for ever. This
alliance does not aim at the gain of any power whatsoever of the
state, but merely at the preservation and security of the freedom of
the state for itself and of other allied states at the same time.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_130" id="FNanchor_130">[130]</a>
The latter do not, however, require, for this reason, to submit
themselves like individuals in the state of nature to public laws
and coercion. The practicability or objective reality of this idea
of federation which is to extend gradually over all states and so
lead to perpetual peace can be shewn. For, if Fortune ordains that
a powerful and enlightened people should form a republic,—which by
its very nature is inclined to perpetual peace—this would serve as a
centre of federal union for other states wishing to join, and thus
secure conditions of freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p.
135]</span> among the states in accordance with the idea of the law
of nations. Gradually, through different unions of this kind, the
federation would extend further and further.</p>
<p>It is quite comprehensible that a people should say:—“There
shall be no war among us, for we shall form ourselves into a state,
that is to say, constitute for ourselves a supreme legislative,
administrative and judicial power which will settle our disputes
peaceably.” But if this state says:—“There shall be no war between me
and other states, although I recognise no supreme law-giving power
which will secure me my rights and whose rights I will guarantee;”
then it is not at all clear upon what grounds I could base my
confidence in my right, unless it were the substitute for that
compact on which civil society is based—namely, free federation which
reason must necessarily connect with the idea of the law of nations,
if indeed any meaning is to be left in that concept at all.</p>
<p>There is no intelligible meaning in the idea of the law of
nations as giving a right to make war; for that must be a right to
decide what is just, not in accordance with universal, external
laws limiting the freedom of each individual, but by means of
one-sided maxims applied by force. We must then understand by
this that men of such ways of thinking are quite justly served,
when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>
destroy one another, and thus find perpetual peace in the wide
grave which covers all the abominations of acts of violence as
well as the authors of such deeds. For states, in their relation
to one another, there can be, according to reason, no other way of
advancing from that lawless condition which unceasing war implies,
than by giving up their savage lawless freedom, just as individual
men have done, and yielding to the coercion of public laws. Thus
they can form a State of nations (<i>civitas gentium</i>), one, too,
which will be ever increasing and would finally embrace all the
peoples of the earth. States, however, in accordance with their
understanding of the law of nations, by no means desire this, and
therefore reject <i>in hypothesi</i> what is correct <i>in thesi</i>. Hence,
instead of the positive idea of a world-republic, if all is not
to be lost, only the negative substitute for it, a federation
averting war, maintaining its ground and ever extending over the
world may stop the current of this tendency to war and shrinking
from the control of law. But even then there will be a constant
danger that this propensity may break out.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_131" id="FNanchor_131">[131]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> “Furor impius intus—fremit horridus

<p class="centra p2"><small>THIRD DEFINITIVE ARTICLE OF PERPETUAL
PEACE</small></p>
<p class="centra p1">III.—“The rights of men, as citizens of the world,
shall be limited to the conditions of universal hospitality.”</p>
<p class="p1">We are speaking here, as in the previous articles,
not of philanthropy, but of right; and in this sphere hospitality
signifies the claim of a stranger entering foreign territory to be
treated by its owner without hostility. The latter may send him
away again, if this can be done without causing his death; but, so
long as he conducts himself peaceably, he must not be treated as
an enemy. It is not a right to be treated as a guest to which the
stranger can lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>
claim—a special friendly compact on his behalf would be required
to make him for a given time an actual inmate—but he has a right
of visitation. This right<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_133" id="FNanchor_133">[133]</a> to present themselves to society belongs
to all mankind in virtue of our common right of possession on
the surface of the earth on which, as it is a globe, we cannot
be infinitely scattered, and must in the end reconcile ourselves
to existence side by side: at the same time, originally no one
individual had more right than another to live in any one particular
spot. Uninhabitable portions of the surface, ocean and desert,
split up the human community, but in such a way that ships and
camels—“the ship of the desert”—make it possible for men to come
into touch with one another across these unappropriated regions
and to take advantage of our common claim to the face of the earth
with a view to a possible intercommunication. The inhospitality of
the inhabitants of certain sea coasts—as, for example, the coast of
Barbary—in plundering ships in neighbouring seas or making slaves
of shipwrecked mariners; or the behaviour of the Arab Bedouins in
the deserts, who think that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p.
139]</span> proximity to nomadic tribes constitutes a right to rob,
is thus contrary to the law of nature. This right to hospitality,
however—that is to say, the privilege of strangers arriving on
foreign soil—does not amount to more than what is implied in a
permission to make an attempt at intercourse with the original
inhabitants. In this way far distant territories may enter into
peaceful relations with one another. These relations may at last
come under the public control of law, and thus the human race may be
brought nearer the realisation of a cosmopolitan constitution.</p>
<p>Let us look now, for the sake of comparison, at the inhospitable
behaviour of the civilised nations, especially the commercial
states of our continent. The injustice which they exhibit on
visiting foreign lands and races—this being equivalent in their
eyes to conquest—is such as to fill us with horror. America, the
negro countries, the Spice Islands, the Cape etc. were, on being
discovered, looked upon as countries which belonged to nobody; for
the native inhabitants were reckoned as nothing. In Hindustan, under
the pretext of intending to establish merely commercial depots, the
Europeans introduced foreign troops; and, as a result, the different
states of Hindustan were stirred up to far-spreading wars. Oppression
of the natives followed, famine, insurrection, perfidy and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span> the rest of the litany
of evils which can afflict mankind.</p>
<p>China<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_134" id="FNanchor_134">[134]</a> and Japan (Nipon) which had made
an attempt at receiving guests of this kind, have now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> taken a prudent step.
Only to a single European people, the Dutch, has China given the
right of access to her shores (but not of entrance into the country),
while Japan has granted both these concessions; but at the same
time they exclude the Dutch who enter, as if they were prisoners,
from social intercourse with the inhabitants. The worst, or from
the standpoint of ethical judgment the best, of all this is that
no satisfaction is derived from all this violence, that all these
trading companies stand on the verge of ruin, that the Sugar Islands,
that seat of the most horrible and delib<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>erate slavery, yield no real profit,
but only have their use indirectly and for no very praiseworthy
object—namely, that of furnishing men to be trained as sailors for
the men-of-war and thereby contributing to the carrying on of war in
Europe. And this has been done by nations who make a great ado about
their piety, and who, while they are quite ready to commit injustice,
would like, in their orthodoxy, to be considered among the elect.</p>
<p>The intercourse, more or less close, which has been everywhere
steadily increasing between the nations of the earth, has now
extended so enormously that a violation of right in one part of the
world is felt all over it. Hence the idea of a cosmopolitan right
is no fantastical, high-flown notion of right, but a complement of
the unwritten code of law—constitutional as well as international
law—necessary for the public rights of mankind in general and thus
for the realisation of perpetual peace. For only by endeavouring
to fulfil the conditions laid down by this cosmopolitan law can we
flatter ourselves that we are gradually approaching that ideal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" title="FIRST SUPPLEMENT CONCERNING THE   GUARANTEE OF PERPETUAL PEACE">FIRST SUPPLEMENT</h2>
<p class="subh3">CONCERNING THE GUARANTEE OF PERPETUAL PEACE</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span>
guarantee is given by no less a power than the great artist nature
(<i>natura dædala rerum</i>) in whose mechanical course is clearly
exhibited a predetermined design to make harmony spring from human
discord, even against the will of man. Now this design, although
called Fate when looked upon as the compelling force of a cause, the
laws of whose operation are unknown to us, is, when considered as
the purpose manifested in the course of nature, called Providence,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_135" id="FNanchor_135">[135]</a> as
the deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>-lying
wisdom of a Higher Cause, directing itself towards the ultimate
practical end of the human race and predetermining the course of
things with a view to its realisation. This Providence we do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> not, it is true,
perceive in the cunning contrivances [<i>Kunstanstalten</i>] of nature;
nor can we even conclude from the fact of their existence that it
is there; but, as in every relation between the form of things
and their final cause, we can, and must, supply the thought of a
Higher Wisdom, in order that we may be able to form an idea of the
possible existence of these products after the analogy of human
works of art [<i>Kunsthand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p.
146]</span>lungen</i>].<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_136" id="FNanchor_136">[136]</a> The representation to ourselves of
the relation and agreement of these formations of nature to the
moral purpose for which they were made and which reason directly
prescribes to us, is an Idea, it is true, which is in theory
superfluous; but in practice it is dogmatic, and its objective
reality is well established.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_137" id="FNanchor_137">[137]</a> Thus we see, for example, with regard to
the ideal [<i>Pflichtbegriff</i>] of perpetual peace, that it is our duty
to make use of the mechanism of nature for the realisation of that
end. Moreover, in a case like this where we are interested merely in
the theory and not in the religious question, the use of the word
“nature” is more appropriate than that of “providence”, in view of
the limitations of human reason, which, in considering the relation
of effects to their causes, must keep within the limits of possible
experience. And the term “nature” is also less presumptuous than the
other. To speak of a Providence knowable by us would be boldly to put
on the wings of Icarus in order to draw near to the mystery of its
unfathomable purpose.</p>
<p>Before we determine the surety given by nature more exactly, we
must first look at what ultimately makes this guarantee of peace
necessary—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span>
circumstances in which nature has carefully placed the actors in her
great theatre. In the next place, we shall proceed to consider the
manner in which she gives this surety.</p>
<p>The provisions she has made are as follow: (1) she has taken
care that men <i>can</i> live in all parts of the world; (2) she has
scattered them by means of war in all directions, even into the most
inhospitable regions, so that these too might be populated; (3) by
this very means she has forced them to enter into relations more or
less controlled by law. It is surely wonderful that, on the cold
wastes round the Arctic Ocean, there is always to be found moss
for the reindeer to scrape out from under the snow, the reindeer
itself either serving as food or to draw the sledge of the Ostiak or
Samoyedes. And salt deserts which would otherwise be left unutilised
have the camel, which seems as if created for travelling in such
lands. This evidence of design in things, however, is still more
clear when we come to know that, besides the fur-clad animals of the
shores of the Arctic Ocean, there are seals, walruses and whales
whose flesh furnishes food and whose oil fire for the dwellers in
these regions. But the providential care of nature excites our wonder
above all, when we hear of the driftwood which is carried—whence
no one knows—to these treeless shores: for without the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> aid of this material
the natives could neither construct their craft, nor weapons, nor
huts for shelter. Here too they have so much to do, making war
against wild animals, that they live at peace with one another. But
what drove them originally into these regions was probably nothing
but war.</p>
<p>Of animals, used by us as instruments of war, the horse was the
first which man learned to tame and domesticate during the period of
the peopling of the earth; the elephant belongs to the later period
of the luxury of states already established. In the same way, the art
of cultivating certain grasses called cereals—no longer known to us
in their original form—and also the multiplication and improvement,
by transplanting and grafting, of the original kinds of fruit—in
Europe, probably only two species, the crab-apple and wild pear—could
only originate under the conditions accompanying established states
where the rights of property are assured. That is to say it would be
after man, hitherto existing in lawless liberty, had advanced beyond
the occupations of a hunter,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_138" id="FNanchor_138">[138]</a> a fisherman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span> or a shepherd to the life of a tiller
of the soil, when salt and iron were discovered,—to become, perhaps,
the first articles of commerce between different peoples,—and were
sought far and near. In this way the peoples would be at first
brought into peaceful relation with one another, and so come to an
understanding and the enjoyment of friendly intercourse, even with
their most distant neighbours.</p>
<p>Now while nature provided that men could live on all parts of
the earth, she also at the same time despotically willed that
they <i>should</i> live everywhere on it, although against their own
inclination and even although this imperative did not presuppose
an idea of duty which would compel obedience to nature with the
force of a moral law. But, to attain this end, she has chosen war.
So we see certain peoples, widely separated, whose common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> descent is made
evident by affinity in their languages. Thus, for instance, we find
the Samoyedes on the Arctic Ocean, and again a people speaking
a similar language on the Altai Mts., 200 miles [<i>Meilen</i>]<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_139" id="FNanchor_139">[139]</a>
off, between whom has pressed in a mounted tribe, warlike in
character and of Mongolian origin, which has driven one branch of
the race far from the other, into the most inhospitable regions
where their own inclination would certainly not have carried them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_140" id="FNanchor_140">[140]</a>
In the same way, through the intrusion of the Gothic and Sarmatian
tribes, the Finns in the most northerly regions of Europe, whom we
call Laplanders, have been separated by as great a distance from the
Hungarians, with whose language their own is allied. And what but war
can have brought the Esquimos to the north of America, a race quite
distinct from those of that country and probably European adventurers
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> prehistoric
times? And war too, nature’s method of populating the earth, must
have driven the Pescherais<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_141" id="FNanchor_141">[141]</a> in South America as far as Patagonia. War
itself, however, is in need of no special stimulating cause, but
seems engrafted in human nature, and is even regarded as something
noble in itself to which man is inspired by the love of glory apart
from motives of self-interest. Hence, among the savages of America as
well as those of Europe in the age of chivalry, martial courage is
looked upon as of great value itself, not merely when a war is going
on, as is reasonable enough, but in order that there should be war:
and thus war is often entered upon merely to exhibit this quality.
So that an intrinsic dignity is held to attach to war in itself, and
even philosophers eulogise it as an ennobling, refining influence on
humanity, unmindful of the Greek proverb, “War is evil, in so far as
it makes more bad people than it takes away.”</p>
<p>So much, then, of what nature does for her own ends with regard
to the human race as members of the animal world. Now comes the
question which touches the essential points in this design of a
perpetual peace:—“What does nature do in this respect with reference
to the end which man’s own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p.
152]</span> reason sets before him as a duty? and consequently what
does she do to further the realisation of his moral purpose? How does
she guarantee that what man, by the laws of freedom, ought to do and
yet fails to do, he will do, without any infringement of his freedom
by the compulsion of nature and that, moreover, this shall be done
in accordance with the three forms of public right—constitutional or
political law, international law and cosmopolitan law?” When I say
of nature that she <i>wills</i> that this or that should take place, I
do not mean that she imposes upon us the duty to do it—for only the
free, unrestrained, practical reason can do that—but that she does
it herself, whether we will or not. “<i>Fata volentem ducunt, nolentem
trahunt.</i>”</p>
<p>1. Even if a people were not compelled through internal discord to
submit to the restraint of public laws, war would bring this about,
working from without. For, according to the contrivance of nature
which we have mentioned, every people finds another tribe in its
neighbourhood, pressing upon it in such a manner that it is compelled
to form itself internally into a state to be able to defend itself as
a power should. Now the republican constitution is the only one which
is perfectly adapted to the rights of man, but it is also the most
difficult to establish and still more to maintain. So generally is
this recognised that people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p.
153]</span> often say the members of a republican state would
require to be angels,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_142" id="FNanchor_142">[142]</a> because men, with their self-seeking
propensities, are not fit for a constitution of so sublime a form.
But now nature comes to the aid of the universal, reason-derived
will which, much as we honour it, is in practice powerless. And this
she does, by means of these very self-seeking propensities, so that
it only depends—and so much lies within the power of man—on a good
organisation of the state for their forces to be so pitted against
one another, that the one may check the destructive activity of the
other or neutralise its effect. And hence, from the standpoint of
reason, the result will be the same as if both forces did not exist,
and each individual is compelled to be, if not a morally good man,
yet at least a good citizen. The problem of the formation of the
state, hard as it may sound, is not insoluble, even for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> race of devils, granted
that they have intelligence. It may be put thus:—“Given a multitude
of rational beings who, in a body, require general laws for their
own preservation, but each of whom, as an individual, is secretly
inclined to exempt himself from this restraint: how are we to order
their affairs and how establish for them a constitution such that,
although their private dispositions may be really antagonistic,
they may yet so act as a check upon one another, that, in their
public relations, the effect is the same as if they had no such evil
sentiments.” Such a problem must be capable of solution. For it
deals, not with the moral reformation of mankind, but only with the
mechanism of nature; and the problem is to learn how this mechanism
of nature can be applied to men, in order so to regulate the
antagonism of conflicting interests in a people that they may even
compel one another to submit to compulsory laws and thus necessarily
bring about the state of peace in which laws have force. We can see,
in states actually existing, although very imperfectly organised,
that, in externals, they already approximate very nearly to what
the Idea of right prescribes, although the principle of morality is
certainly not the cause. A good political constitution, however, is
not to be expected as a result of progress in morality; but rather,
conversely, the good moral condition of a nation is to be looked for,
as one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span> the
first fruits of such a constitution. Hence the mechanism of nature,
working through the self-seeking propensities of man (which of course
counteract one another in their external effects), may be used by
reason as a means of making way for the realisation of her own
purpose, the empire of right, and, as far as is in the power of the
state, to promote and secure in this way internal as well as external
peace. We may say, then, that it is the irresistible will of nature
that right shall at last get the supremacy. What one here fails to
do will be accomplished in the long run, although perhaps with much
inconvenience to us. As Bouterwek says, “If you bend the reed too
much it breaks: he who would do too much does nothing.”</p>
<p>2. The idea of international law presupposes the separate
existence of a number of neighbouring and independent states; and,
although such a condition of things is in itself already a state
of war, (if a federative union of these nations does not prevent
the outbreak of hostilities) yet, according to the Idea of reason,
this is better than that all the states should be merged into one
under a power which has gained the ascendency over its neighbours
and gradually become a universal monarchy.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_143" id="FNanchor_143">[143]</a> For the wider the
sphere of their jurisdic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p.
156]</span>tion, the more laws lose in force; and soulless despotism,
when it has choked the seeds of good, at last sinks into anarchy.
Nevertheless it is the desire of every state, or of its ruler, to
attain to a permanent condition of peace in this very way; that is to
say, by subjecting the whole world as far as possible to its sway.
But nature wills it otherwise. She employs two means to separate
nations, and prevent them from intermixing: namely, the differences
of language and of religion.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_144" id="FNanchor_144">[144]</a> These differences bring with them a
tendency to mutual hatred, and furnish pretexts for waging war. But,
none the less, with the growth of culture and the gradual advance
of men to greater unanimity of principle, they lead to concord in a
state of peace which, unlike the despotism we have spoken of, (the
churchyard of freedom) does not arise from the weakening of all
forces, but is brought into being and secured through the equilibrium
of these forces in their most active rivalry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span>3. As nature
wisely separates nations which the will of each state, sanctioned
even by the principles of international law, would gladly unite under
its own sway by stratagem or force; in the same way, on the other
hand, she unites nations whom the principle of a cosmopolitan right
would not have secured against violence and war. And this union
she brings about through an appeal to their mutual interests. The
commercial spirit cannot co-exist with war, and sooner or later it
takes possession of every nation. For, of all the forces which lie
at the command of a state, the power of money is probably the most
reliable. Hence states find themselves compelled—not, it is true,
exactly from motives of morality—to further the noble end of peace
and to avert war, by means of mediation, wherever it threatens to
break out, just as if they had made a permanent league for this
purpose. For great alliances with a view to war can, from the nature
of things, only very rarely occur, and still more seldom succeed.</p>
<p>In this way nature guarantees the coming of perpetual peace,
through the natural course of human propensities: not indeed with
sufficient certainty to enable us to prophesy the future of this
ideal theoretically, but yet clearly enough for practical purposes.
And thus this guarantee of nature makes it a duty that we should
labour for this end, an end which is no mere chimera.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" title="SECOND SUPPLEMENT—A SECRET ARTICLE FOR   PERPETUAL PEACE">SECOND SUPPLEMENT</h2>
<p class="subh3">A SECRET ARTICLE FOR PERPETUAL PEACE</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">A secret</span>
article in negotiations concerning public right is, when looked
at objectively or with regard to the meaning of the term, a
contradiction. When we view it, however, from the subjective
standpoint, with regard to the character and condition of the person
who dictates it, we see that it might quite well involve some private
consideration, so that he would regard it as hazardous to his dignity
to acknowledge such an article as originating from him.</p>
<p>The only article of this kind is contained in the following
proposition:—“The opinions of philosophers, with regard to the
conditions of the possibility of a public peace, shall be taken into
consideration by states armed for war.”</p>
<p>It seems, however, to be derogatory to the dignity of the
legislative authority of a state—to which we must of course
attribute all wisdom—to ask advice from subjects (among whom stand
philosophers) about the rules of its behaviour to other states. At
the same time, it is very advisable that this should be done. Hence
the state will silently invite suggestion for this purpose, while
at the same time keeping the fact secret. This amounts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> saying that the state
will allow philosophers to discuss freely and publicly the universal
principles governing the conduct of war and establishment of peace;
for they will do this of their own accord, if no prohibition
is laid upon them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_145" id="FNanchor_145">[145]</a> The arrangement between states, on this
point, does not require that a special agreement should be made,
merely for this purpose; for it is already involved in the obligation
imposed by the universal reason of man which gives the moral law. We
would not be understood to say that the state must give a preference
to the principles of the philosopher, rather than to the opinions
of the jurist, the representative of state authority; but only
that he should be heard. The latter, who has chosen for a symbol
the scales of right and the sword of justice,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_146" id="FNanchor_146">[146]</a> generally uses that
sword not merely to keep off all outside influences from the scales;
for, when one pan of the balance will not go down, he throws his
sword into it; and then <i>Væ victis</i>! The jurist, not being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span> a moral philosopher, is
under the greatest temptation to do this, because it is his business
only to apply existing laws and not to investigate whether these
are not themselves in need of improvement; and this actually lower
function of his profession he looks upon as the nobler, because it
is linked to power (as is the case also in both the other faculties,
theology and medicine). Philosophy occupies a very low position
compared with this combined power. So that it is said, for example,
that she is the handmaid of theology; and the same has been said of
her position with regard to law and medicine. It is not quite clear,
however, “whether she bears the torch before these gracious ladies,
or carries the train.”</p>
<p>That kings should philosophise, or philosophers become kings,
is not to be expected. But neither is it to be desired; for the
possession of power is inevitably fatal to the free exercise of
reason. But it is absolutely indispensable, for their enlightenment
as to the full significance of their vocations, that both kings and
sovereign nations, which rule themselves in accordance with laws of
equality, should not allow the class of philosophers to disappear,
nor forbid the expression of their opinions, but should allow
them to speak openly. And since this class of men, by their very
nature, are incapable of instigating rebellion or forming unions for
purposes of political agitation, they should not be suspected of
propagandism.</p>

<p class="subh3">ON THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN MORALS AND POLITICS WITH
  REFERENCE TO PERPETUAL PEACE</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span>
an objective sense, morals is a practical science, as the sum of
laws exacting unconditional obedience, in accordance with which we
<i>ought</i> to act. Now, once we have admitted the authority of this
idea of duty, it is evidently inconsistent that we should think of
saying that we <i>cannot</i> act thus. For, in this case, the idea of duty
falls to the ground of itself; “<i>ultra posse nemo obligatur</i>.” Hence
there can be no quarrel between politics, as the practical science of
right, and morals, which is also a science of right, but theoretical.
That is, theory cannot come into conflict with practice. For, in that
case, we would need to understand under the term “ethics” or “morals”
a universal doctrine of expediency, or, in other words, a theory of
precepts which may guide us in choosing the best means for attaining
ends calculated for our advantage. This is to deny that a science of
morals exists.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span></p>
<p>Politics says, “Be wise as serpents”; morals adds the limiting
condition, “and guileless as doves.” If these precepts cannot stand
together in one command, then there is a real quarrel between
politics and morals.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_147" id="FNanchor_147">[147]</a> But if they can be completely brought into
accord, then the idea of any antagonism between them is absurd, and
the question of how best to make a compromise between the two points
of view ceases to be even raised. Although the saying, “Honesty is
the best policy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>”
expresses a theory which, alas, is often contradicted in practice,
yet the likewise theoretical maxim, “Honesty is better than any
policy,” is exalted high above every possible objection, is indeed
the necessary condition of all politics.</p>
<p>The Terminus of morals does not yield to Jupiter, the Terminus
of force; for the latter remains beneath the sway of Fate. In other
words, reason is not sufficiently enlightened to survey the series
of predetermining causes which would make it possible for us to
predict with certainty the good or bad results of human action, as
they follow from the mechanical laws of nature; although we may hope
that things will turn out as we should desire. But what we have to
do, in order to remain in the path of duty guided by the rules of
wisdom, reason makes everywhere perfectly clear, and does this for
the purpose of furthering her ultimate ends.</p>
<p>The practical man, however, for whom morals is mere theory, even
while admitting that what ought to be can be, bases his dreary
verdict against our well-meant hopes really on this: he pretends
that he can foresee from his observation of human nature, that men
will never be willing to do what is required in order to bring about
the wished-for results leading to perpetual peace. It is true that
the will of all individual men to live under a legal constitution
according to the principles of liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>—that is to say, the distributive
unity of the wills of all—is not sufficient to attain this end. We
must have the collective unity of their united will: all as a body
must determine these new conditions. The solution of this difficult
problem is required in order that civil society should be a whole.
To all this diversity of individual wills there must come a uniting
cause, in order to produce a common will which no distributive will
is able to give. Hence, in the practical realisation of that idea, no
other beginning of a law-governed society can be counted upon than
one that is brought about by force: upon this force, too, public law
afterwards rests. This state of things certainly prepares us to meet
considerable deviation in actual experience from the theoretical
idea of perpetual peace, since we cannot take into account the moral
character and disposition of a law-giver in this connection, or
expect that, after he has united a wild multitude into one people, he
will leave it to them to bring about a legal constitution by their
common will.</p>
<p>It amounts to this. Any ruler who has once got the power in his
hands will not let the people dictate laws for him. A state which
enjoys an independence of the control of external law will not
submit to the judgment of the tribunals of other states, when it has
to consider how to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p.
165]</span> its rights against them. And even a continent, when
it feels its superiority to another, whether this be in its way
or not, will not fail to take advantage of an opportunity offered
of strengthening its power by the spoliation or even conquest of
this territory. Hence all theoretical schemes, connected with
constitutional, international or cosmopolitan law, crumble away into
empty impracticable ideals. While, on the other hand, a practical
science, based on the empirical principles of human nature, which
does not disdain to model its maxims on an observation of actual
life, can alone hope to find a sure foundation on which to build up a
system of national policy.</p>
<p>Now certainly, if there is neither freedom nor a moral law
founded upon it, and every actual or possible event happens in
the mere mechanical course of nature, then politics, as the
art of making use of this physical necessity in things for the
government of men, is the whole of practical wisdom and the idea
of right is an empty concept. If, on the other hand, we find that
this idea of right is necessarily to be conjoined with politics
and even to be raised to the position of a limiting condition of
that science, then the possibility of reconciling them must be
admitted. I can thus imagine a moral politician, that is to say, one
who understands the principles of statesmanship to be such as do
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> conflict with
morals; but I cannot conceive of a political moralist who fashions
for himself such a system of ethics as may serve the interest of
statesmen.</p>
<p>The moral politician will always act upon the following
principle:—“If certain defects which could not have been avoided
are found in the political constitution or foreign relations of a
state, it is a duty for all, especially for the rulers of the state,
to apply their whole energy to correcting them as soon as possible,
and to bringing the constitution and political relations on these
points into conformity with the Law of Nature, as it is held up as a
model before us in the idea of reason; and this they should do even
at a sacrifice of their own interest.” Now it is contrary to all
politics—which is, in this particular, in agreement with morals—to
dissever any of the links binding citizens together in the state
or nations in cosmopolitan union, before a better constitution is
there to take the place of what has been thus destroyed. And hence
it would be absurd indeed to demand that every imperfection in
political matters must be violently altered on the spot. But, at the
same time, it may be required of a ruler at least that he should
earnestly keep the maxim in mind which points to the necessity of
such a change; so that he may go on constantly approaching the end
to be realised,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>
namely, the best possible constitution according to the laws of
right. Even although it is still under despotic rule, in accordance
with its constitution as then existing, a state may govern itself
on republican lines, until the people gradually become capable of
being influenced by the mere idea of the authority of law, just as
if it had physical power. And they become accordingly capable of
self-legislation, their faculty for which is founded on original
right. But if, through the violence of revolution, the product of
a bad government, a constitution more in accord with the spirit of
law were attained even by unlawful means, it should no longer be
held justifiable to bring the people back to the old constitution,
although, while the revolution was going on, every one who took
part in it by use of force or stratagem, may have been justly
punished as a rebel. As regards the external relations of nations,
a state cannot be asked to give up its constitution, even although
that be a despotism (which is, at the same time, the strongest
constitution where foreign enemies are concerned), so long as it
runs the risk of being immediately swallowed up by other states.
Hence, when such a proposal is made, the state whose constitution is
in question must at least be allowed to defer acting upon it until
a more convenient time.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_148" id="FNanchor_148">[148]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span></p> <p>It is always possible that
moralists who rule despotically, and are at a loss in practical
matters, will come into collision with the rules of political wisdom
in many ways, by adopting measures without sufficient deliberation
which show themselves afterwards to have been overestimated. When
they thus offend against nature, experience must gradually lead them
into a better track. But, instead of this being the case, politicians
who are fond of moralising do all they can to make moral improvement
impossible and to perpetuate violations of law, by extenuating
political principles which are antagonistic to the idea of right, on
the pretext that human nature is not capable of good, in the sense of
the ideal which reason prescribes.</p>
<p>These politicians, instead of adopting an open, straightforward
way of doing things (as they boast), mix themselves up in intrigue.
They get at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span>
authorities in power and say what will please them; their sole
bent is to sacrifice the nation, or even, if they can, the whole
world, with the one end in view that their own private interest
may be forwarded. This is the manner of regular jurists (I mean
the journeyman lawyer not the legislator), when they aspire to
politics. For, as it is not their business to reason too nicely over
legislation, but only to enforce the laws of the country, every
legal constitution in its existing form and, when this is changed
by the proper authorities, the one which takes its place, will
always seem to them the best possible. And the consequence is that
everything is purely mechanical. But this adroitness in suiting
themselves to any circumstances may lead them to the delusion that
they are also capable of giving an opinion about the principles of
political constitutions in general, in so far as they conform to
ideas of right, and are therefore not empirical, but <i>a priori</i>. And
they may therefore brag about their knowledge of men,—which indeed
one expects to find, since they have to deal with so many—without
really knowing the nature of man and what can be made of it, to gain
which knowledge a higher standpoint of anthropological observation
than theirs is required. Filled with ideas of this kind, if they
trespass outside their own sphere on the boundaries of political
and international law,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p.
170]</span> looked upon as ideals which reason holds before us, they
can do so only in the spirit of chicanery. For they will follow their
usual method of making everything conform mechanically to compulsory
laws despotically made and enforced, even here, where the ideas of
reason recognise the validity of a legal compulsory force, only when
it is in accordance with the principles of freedom through which a
permanently valid constitution becomes first of all possible. The
would-be practical man, leaving out of account this idea of reason,
thinks that he can solve this problem empirically by looking to the
way in which those constitutions which have best survived the test
of time were established, even although the spirit of these may have
been generally contrary to the idea of right. The principles which
he makes use of here, although indeed he does not make them public,
amount pretty much to the following sophistical maxims.</p>
<p>1. <b>Fac et excusa.</b> Seize the most favourable opportunity for
arbitrary usurpation—either of the authority of the state over its
own people or over a neighbouring people; the justification of the
act and extenuation of the use of force will come much more easily
and gracefully, when the deed is done, than if one has to think
out convincing reasons for taking this step and first hear through
all the objections which can be made against it. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> especially true in
the first case mentioned, where the supreme power in the state also
controls the legislature which we must obey without any reasoning
about it. Besides, this show of audacity in a statesman even lends
him a certain semblance of inward conviction of the justice of
his action; and once he has got so far the god of success (<i>bonus
eventus</i>) is his best advocate.</p>
<p>2. <b>Si fecisti, nega.</b> As for any crime you have committed,
such as has, for instance, brought your people to despair and thence
to insurrection, deny that it has happened owing to any fault of
yours. Say rather that it is all caused by the insubordination of
your subjects, or, in the case of your having usurped a neighbouring
state, that human nature is to blame; for, if a man is not ready to
use force and steal a march upon his neighbour, he may certainly
count on the latter forestalling him and taking him prisoner.</p>
<p>3. <b>Divide et impera.</b> That is to say, if there are certain
privileged persons, holding authority among the people, who have
merely chosen you for their sovereign as <i>primus inter pares</i>,
bring about a quarrel among them, and make mischief between them
and the people. Now back up the people with a dazzling promise of
greater freedom; everything will now depend unconditionally on your
will. Or again, if there is a difficulty with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span> foreign states, then to stir up
dissension among them is a pretty sure means of subjecting first one
and then the other to your sway, under the pretext of aiding the
weaker.</p>
<p>It is true that now-a-days no body is taken in by these political
maxims, for they are all familiar to everyone. Moreover, there is
no need of being ashamed of them, as if their injustice were too
patent. For the great Powers never feel shame before the judgment of
the common herd, but only before one another; so that as far as this
matter goes, it is not the revelation of these guiding principles of
policy that can make rulers ashamed, but only the unsuccessful use
of them. For as to the morality of these maxims, politicians are all
agreed. Hence there is always left political prestige on which they
can safely count; and this means the glory of increasing their power
by any means that offer.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_149" id="FNanchor_149">[149]</a></p>
<p class="tb">*   *   *</p>
<p>In all these twistings and turnings of an immoral doctrine of
expediency which aims at substituting a state of peace for the
warlike conditions in which men are placed by nature, so much at
least is clear;—that men cannot get away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span> the idea of right in their private any
more than in their public relations; and that they do not dare (this
is indeed most strikingly seen in the concept of an international
law) to base politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p.
174]</span> merely on the manipulations of expediency and therefore
to refuse all obedience to the idea of a public right. On the
contrary, they pay all fitting honour to the idea of right in itself,
even although they should, at the same time, devise a hundred
subterfuges and excuses to avoid it in practice, and should regard
force, backed up by cunning, as having the authority which comes
from being the source and unifying principle of all right. It will
be well to put an end to this sophistry, if not to the injustice it
extenuates, and to bring the false advocates of the mighty of the
earth to confess that it is not right but might in whose interest
they speak, and that it is the worship of might from which they take
their cue, as if in this matter they had a right to command. In order
to do this, we must first expose the delusion by which they deceive
them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span>selves and
others; then discover the ultimate principle from which their plans
for a perpetual peace proceed; and thence show that all the evil
which stands in the way of the realisation of that ideal springs
from the fact that the political moralist begins where the moral
politician rightly ends and that, by subordinating principles to an
end or putting the cart before the horse, he defeats his intention of
bringing politics into harmony with morals.</p>
<p>In order to make practical philosophy consistent with itself,
we must first decide the following question:—In dealing with the
problems of practical reason must we begin from its material
principle—the end as the object of free choice—or from its formal
principle which is based merely on freedom in its external
relation?—from which comes the following law:—“Act so that thou
canst will that thy maxim should be a universal law, be the end of
thy action what it will.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_150" id="FNanchor_150">[150]</a></p>
<p>Without doubt, the latter determining principle of action must
stand first; for, as a principle of right, it carries unconditional
necessity with it, whereas the former is obligatory only if we
assume the empirical conditions of the end set before us,—that is
to say, that it is an end capable of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> practically realised. And if this
end—as, for example, the end of perpetual peace—should be also a
duty, this same duty must necessarily have been deduced from the
formal principle governing the maxims which guide external action.
Now the first principle is the principle of the political moralist;
the problems of constitutional, international and cosmopolitan law
are mere technical problems (<i>problema technicum</i>). The second or
formal principle, on the other hand, as the principle of the moral
politician who regards it as a moral problem (<i>problema morale</i>),
differs widely from the other principle in its methods of bringing
about perpetual peace, which we desire not only as a material good,
but also as a state of things resulting from our recognition of
the precepts of duty.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_151" id="FNanchor_151">[151]</a></p>
<p>To solve the first problem—that, namely, of political
expediency—much knowledge of nature is required, that her mechanical
laws may be employed for the end in view. And yet the result of all
knowledge of this kind is uncertain, as far as perpetual peace is
concerned. This we find to be so, whichever of the three departments
of public law we take. It is uncertain whether a people could be
better kept in obedience and at the same time prosperity by severity
or by baits held out to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p.
177]</span> vanity; whether they would be better governed under the
sovereignty of a single individual or by the authority of several
acting together; whether the combined authority might be better
secured merely, say, by an official nobility or by the power of the
people within the state; and, finally, whether such conditions could
be long maintained. There are examples to the contrary in history
in the case of all forms of government, with the exception of the
only true republican constitution, the idea of which can occur only
to a moral politician. Still more uncertain is a law of nations,
ostensibly established upon statutes devised by ministers; for this
amounts in fact to mere empty words, and rests on treaties which,
in the very act of ratification, contain a secret reservation of
the right to violate them. On the other hand, the solution of the
second problem—the problem of political wisdom—forces itself, we may
say, upon us; it is quite obvious to every one, and puts all crooked
dealings to shame; it leads, too, straight to the desired end, while
at the same time, discretion warns us not to drag in the conditions
of perpetual peace by force, but to take time and approach this ideal
gradually as favourable circumstances permit.</p>
<p>This may be expressed in the following maxim:—“Seek ye first
the kingdom of pure practical reason and its righteousness, and
the object of your en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p.
178]</span>deavour, the blessing of perpetual peace, will be
added unto you.” For the science of morals generally has this
peculiarity,—and it has it also with regard to the moral principles
of public law, and therefore with regard to a science of politics
knowable <i>a priori</i>,—that the less it makes a man’s conduct depend
on the end he has set before him, his purposed material or moral
gain, so much the more, nevertheless, does it conform in general
to this end. The reason for this is that it is just the universal
will, given <i>a priori</i>, which exists in a people or in the relation
of different peoples to one another, that alone determines what is
lawful among men. This union of individual wills, however, if we
proceed consistently in practice, in observance of the mechanical
laws of nature, may be at the same time the cause of bringing about
the result intended and practically realizing the idea of right.
Hence it is, for example, a principle of moral politics that a people
should unite into a state according to the only valid concepts
of right, the ideas of freedom and equality; and this principle
is not based on expediency, but upon duty. Political moralists,
however, do not deserve a hearing, much and sophistically as they
may reason about the existence, in a multitude of men forming a
society, of certain natural tendencies which would weaken those
principles and defeat their intention. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span> may endeavour to prove their assertion
by giving instances of badly organised constitutions, chosen both
from ancient and modern times, (as, for example, democracies without
a representative system); but such arguments are to be treated with
contempt, all the more, because a pernicious theory of this kind
may perhaps even bring about the evil which it prophesies. For, in
accordance with such reasoning, man is thrown into a class with all
other living machines which only require the consciousness that they
are not free creatures to make them in their own judgment the most
miserable of all beings.</p>
<p><i>Fiat justitia, pereat mundus.</i> This saying has become proverbial,
and although it savours a little of boastfulness, is also true. We
may translate it thus:—“Let justice rule on earth, although all the
rogues in the world should go to the bottom.” It is a good, honest
principle of right cutting off all the crooked ways made by knavery
or violence. It must not, however, be misunderstood as allowing
anyone to exercise his own rights with the utmost severity, a course
in contradiction to our moral duty; but we must take it to signify an
obligation, binding upon rulers, to refrain from refusing to yield
anyone his rights or from curtailing them, out of personal feeling
or sympathy for others. For this end, in particular, we require,
firstly, that a state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p.
180]</span> should have an internal political constitution,
established according to the pure principles of right; secondly,
that a union should be formed between this state and neighbouring or
distant nations for a legal settlement of their differences, after
the analogy of the universal state. This proposition means nothing
more than this:—Political maxims must not start from the idea of a
prosperity and happiness which are to be expected from observance
of such precepts in every state; that is, not from the end which
each nation makes the object of its will as the highest empirical
principle of political wisdom; but they must set out from the pure
concept of the duty of right, from the “<i>ought</i>” whose principle
is given <i>a priori</i> through pure reason. This is the law, whatever
the material consequences may be. The world will certainly not
perish by any means, because the number of wicked people in it is
becoming fewer. The morally bad has one peculiarity, inseparable from
its nature;—in its purposes, especially in relation to other evil
influences, it is in contradiction with itself, and counteracts its
own natural effect, and thus makes room for the moral principle of
good, although advance in this direction may be slow.</p>
<p>Hence objectively, in theory, there is no quarrel between morals
and politics. But subjectively, in the self-seeking tendencies of men
(which we cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span>
actually call their morality, as we would a course of action based
on maxims of reason,) this disagreement in principle exists and may
always survive; for it serves as a whetstone to virtue. According
to the principle, <i>Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito</i>, the
true courage of virtue in the present case lies not so much in facing
the evils and self-sacrifices which must be met here as in firmly
confronting the evil principle in our own nature and conquering its
wiles. For this is a principle far more dangerous, false, treacherous
and sophistical which puts forward the weakness in human nature as a
justification for every transgression.</p>
<p>In fact the political moralist may say that a ruler and people,
or nation and nation do <i>one another</i> no wrong, when they enter on
a war with violence or cunning, although they do wrong, generally
speaking, in refusing to respect the idea of right which alone could
establish peace for all time. For, as both are equally wrongly
disposed to one another, each transgressing the duty he owes to his
neighbour, they are both quite rightly served, when they are thus
destroyed in war. This mutual destruction stops short at the point of
extermination, so that there are always enough of the race left to
keep this game going on through all the ages, and a far-off posterity
may take warning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span>
by them. The Providence that orders the course of the world is
hereby justified. For the moral principle in mankind never becomes
extinguished, and human reason, fitted for the practical realisation
of ideas of right according to that principle, grows continually in
fitness for that purpose with the ever advancing march of culture;
while at the same time, it must be said, the guilt of transgression
increases as well. But it seems that, by no theodicy or vindication
of the justice of God, can we justify Creation in putting such a
race of corrupt creatures into the world at all, if, that is, we
assume that the human race neither will nor can ever be in a happier
condition than it is now. This standpoint, however, is too high a
one for us to judge from, or to theorise, with the limited concepts
we have at our command, about the wisdom of that supreme Power which
is unknowable by us. We are inevitably driven to such despairing
conclusions as these, if we do not admit that the pure principles of
right have objective reality—that is to say, are capable of being
practically realised—and consequently that action must be taken on
the part of the people of a state and, further, by states in relation
to one another, whatever arguments empirical politics may bring
forward against this course. Politics in the real sense cannot take
a step forward without first paying homage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span> to the principles of morals. And,
although politics, <i>per se</i>, is a difficult art,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_152" id="FNanchor_152">[152]</a> in its union with
morals no art is required; for in the case of a conflict arising
between the two sciences, the moralist can cut asunder the knot
which politics is unable to untie. Right must be held sacred by man,
however great the cost and sacrifice to the ruling power. Here is no
half-and-half course. We cannot devise a happy medium between right
and expediency, a right pragmatically conditioned. But all politics
must bend the knee to the principle of right, and may, in that way,
hope to reach, although slowly perhaps, a level whence it may shine
upon men for all time.</p>

<p class="subh3">CONCERNING THE HARMONY OF POLITICS WITH MORALS
  ACCORDING TO THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEA OF PUBLIC RIGHT</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span>
I look at public right from the point of view of most professors
of law, and abstract from its <i>matter</i> or its empirical elements,
varying according to the circumstances given in our experience of
individuals in a state or of states among themselves, then there
remains the <i>form</i> of publicity. The possibility of this publicity,
every legal title implies. For without it there could be no justice,
which can only be thought as before the eyes of men; and, without
justice, there would be no right, for, from justice only, right can
come.</p>
<p>This characteristic of publicity must belong to every legal
title. Hence, as, in any particular case that occurs, there is no
difficulty in deciding whether this essential attribute is present
or not, (whether, that is, it is reconcilable with the principles of
the agent or not), it furnishes an easily applied criterion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span> which is to be found <i>a
priori</i> in the reason, so that in the particular case we can at once
recognise the falsity or illegality of a proposed claim (<i>praetensio
juris</i>), as it were by an experiment of pure reason.</p>
<p>Having thus, as it were, abstracted from all the empirical
elements contained in the concept of a political and international
law, such as, for instance, the evil tendency in human nature which
makes compulsion necessary, we may give the following proposition as
the <i>transcendental formula</i> of public right:—“All actions relating
to the rights of other men are wrong, if the maxims from which they
follow are inconsistent with publicity.”</p>
<p>This principle must be regarded not merely as ethical, as
belonging to the doctrine of virtue, but also as juridical, referring
to the rights of men. For there is something wrong in a maxim of
conduct which I cannot divulge without at once defeating my purpose,
a maxim which must therefore be kept secret, if it is to succeed, and
which I could not publicly acknowledge without infallibly stirring up
the opposition of everyone. This necessary and universal resistance
with which everyone meets me, a resistance therefore evident <i>a
priori</i>, can be due to no other cause than the injustice with which
such a maxim threatens everyone. Further, this testing principle is
merely negative; that is, it serves only as a means by which we may
know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span> when an
action is unjust to others. Like axioms, it has a certainty incapable
of demonstration; it is besides easy of application as appears from
the following examples of public right.</p>
<p>1.—<b>Constitutional Law.</b> Let us take in the first place
the public law of the state (<i>jus civitatis</i>), particularly in its
application to matters within the state. Here a question arises
which many think difficult to answer, but which the transcendental
principle of publicity solves quite readily:—“Is revolution a
legitimate means for a people to adopt, for the purpose of throwing
off the oppressive yoke of a so-called tyrant (<i>non titulo, sed
exercitio talis</i>)?” The rights of a nation are violated in a
government of this kind, and no wrong is done to the tyrant in
dethroning him. Of this there is no doubt. None the less, it is in
the highest degree wrong of the subjects to prosecute their rights in
this way; and they would be just as little justified in complaining,
if they happened to be defeated in their attempt and had to endure
the severest punishment in consequence.</p>
<p>A great many reasons for and against both sides of this
question may be given, if we seek to settle it by a dogmatic
deduction of the principles of right. But the transcendental
principle of the publicity of public right can spare itself this
diffuse argumentation. For, according to that principle, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> people would ask
themselves, before the civil contract was made, whether they could
venture to publish maxims, proposing insurrection when a favourable
opportunity should present itself. It is quite clear that if, when
a constitution is established, it were made a condition that force
may be exercised against the sovereign under certain circumstances,
the people would be obliged to claim a lawful authority higher than
his. But in that case, the so-called sovereign would be no longer
sovereign: or, if both powers, that of the sovereign and that of
the people, were made a condition of the constitution of the state,
then its establishment (which was the aim of the people) would be
impossible. The wrongfulness of revolution is quite obvious from
the fact that openly to acknowledge maxims which justify this step
would make attainment of the end at which they aim impossible. We are
obliged to keep them secret. But this secrecy would not be necessary
on the part of the head of the state. He may say quite plainly
that the ringleaders of every rebellion will be punished by death,
even although they may hold that it was he who first transgressed
the fundamental law. For, if a ruler is conscious of possessing
irresistible sovereign power (and this must be assumed in every civil
constitution, because a sovereign who has not power to protect any
individual member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span>
of the nation against his neighbour has also not the right to
exercise authority over him), then he need have no fear that making
known the maxims which guide him will cause the defeat of his plans.
And it is quite consistent with this view to hold that, if the people
are successful in their insurrection, the sovereign must return to
the rank of a subject, and refrain from inciting rebellion with a
view to regaining his lost sovereignty. At the same time he need have
no fear of being called to account for his former administration.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_153" id="FNanchor_153">[153]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span></p>
<p>2.—<b>International Law.</b> There can be no question of an
international law, except on the assumption of some kind of a
law-governed state of things, the external condition under which any
right can belong to man. For the very idea of international law, as
public right, implies the publication of a universal will determining
the rights and property of each individual nation; and this <i>status
juridicus</i> must spring out of a contract of some sort which may not,
like the contract to which the state owes its origin, be founded
upon compulsory laws, but may be, at the most, the agreement of a
permanent free association such as the federation of the different
states, to which we have alluded above. For, without the control
of law to some extent, to serve as an active bond of union among
different merely natural or moral individuals,—that is to say, in
a state of nature,—there can only be private law. And here we find
a disagreement between morals, regarded as the science of right,
and politics. The criterion, obtained by observing the effect of
publicity on maxims, is just as easily applied, but only when we
understand that this agreement binds the contracting states solely
with the object that peace may be preserved among them, and between
them and other states; in no sense with a view to the acquisition of
new territory or power. The following instances of antinomy occur
between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span> politics
and morals, which are given here with the solution in each case.</p>
<p><i>a.</i> “When either of these states has promised something to
another, (as, for instance, assistance, or a relinquishment of
certain territory, or subsidies and such like), the question may
arise whether, in a case where the safety of the state thus bound
depends on its evading the fulfilment of this promise, it can do so
by maintaining a right to be regarded as a double person:—firstly,
as sovereign and accountable to no one in the state of which that
sovereign power is head; and, secondly, merely as the highest
official in the service of that state, who is obliged to answer to
the state for every action. And the result of this is that the state
is acquitted in its second capacity of any obligation to which it has
committed itself in the first.” But, if a nation or its sovereign
proclaimed these maxims, the natural consequence would be that every
other would flee from it, or unite with other states to oppose such
pretensions. And this is a proof that politics, with all its cunning,
defeats its own ends, if the test of making principles of action
public, which we have indicated, be applied. Hence the maxim we have
quoted must be wrong.</p>
<p><i>b.</i> “If a state which has increased its power to a formidable
extent (<i>potentia tremenda</i>) excites anxiety in its neighbours, is it
right to assume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>
that, since it has the means, it will also have the will to oppress
others; and does that give less powerful states a right to unite and
attack the greater nation without any definite cause of offence?” A
state which would here answer openly in the affirmative would only
bring the evil about more surely and speedily. For the greater power
would forestall those smaller nations, and their union would be but
a weak reed of defence against a state which knew how to apply the
maxim, <i>divide et impera</i>. This maxim of political expediency then,
when openly acknowledged, necessarily defeats the end at which it
aims, and is therefore wrong.</p>
<p><i>c.</i> “If a smaller state by its geographical position breaks
up the territory of a greater, so as to prevent a unity necessary
to the preservation of that state, is the latter not justified in
subjugating its less powerful neighbour and uniting the territory
in question with its own?” We can easily see that the greater state
dare not publish such a maxim beforehand; for either all smaller
states would without loss of time unite against it, or other powers
would contend for this booty. Hence the impracticability of such a
maxim becomes evident under the light of publicity. And this is a
sign that it is wrong, and that in a very great degree; for, although
the victim of an act of injustice may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> of small account, that does not prevent
the injustice done from being very great.</p>
<p>3.—<b>Cosmopolitan Law.</b> We may pass over this department of
right in silence, for, owing to its analogy with international law,
its maxims are easily specified and estimated.</p>
<p class="tb">*   *   *</p>
<p>In this principle of the incompatibility of the maxims of
international law with their publicity, we have a good indication
of the non-agreement between politics and morals, regarded as a
science of right. Now we require to know under what conditions these
maxims do agree with the law of nations. For we cannot conclude that
the converse holds, and that all maxims which can bear publicity
are therefore just. For anyone who has a decided supremacy has
no need to make any secret about his maxims. The condition of a
law of nations being possible at all is that, in the first place,
there should be a law-governed state of things. If this is not so,
there can be no public right, and all right which we can think of
outside the law-governed state,—that is to say, in the state of
nature,—is mere private right. Now we have seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> above that something of the nature of
a federation between nations, for the sole purpose of doing away
with war, is the only rightful condition of things reconcilable
with their individual freedom. Hence the agreement of politics and
morals is only possible in a federative union, a union which is
necessarily given <i>a priori</i>, according to the principles of right.
And the lawful basis of all politics can only be the establishment
of this union in its widest possible extent. Apart from this end,
all political sophistry is folly and veiled injustice. Now this sham
politics has a casuistry, not to be excelled in the best Jesuit
school. It has its mental reservation (<i>reservatio mentalis</i>): as
in the drawing up of a public treaty in such terms as we can, if we
will, interpret when occasion serves to our advantage; for example,
the distinction between the <i>status quo</i> in fact (<i>de fait</i>) and
in right (<i>de droit</i>). Secondly, it has its probabilism; when it
pretends to discover evil intentions in another, or makes, the
probability of their possible future ascendency a lawful reason
for bringing about the destruction of other peaceful states.
Finally, it has its philosophical sin (<i>peccatum philosophicum</i>,
<i>peccatillum</i>, <i>baggatelle</i>) which is that of holding it a trifle
easily pardoned that a smaller state should be swallowed up, if this
be to the gain of a nation much more powerful; for such an increase
in power is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span>
supposed to tend to the greater prosperity of the whole world.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_154" id="FNanchor_154">[154]</a></p>
<p>Duplicity gives politics the advantage of using one branch or
the other of morals, just as suits its own ends. The love of our
fellowmen is a duty: so too is respect for their rights. But the
former is only conditional: the latter, on the other hand, an
unconditional, absolutely imperative duty; and anyone who would
give himself up to the sweet consciousness of well-doing must be
first perfectly assured that he has not transgressed its commands.
Politics has no difficulty in agreeing with morals in the first sense
of the term, as ethics, to secure that men should give to superiors
their rights. But when it comes to morals, in its second aspect,
as the science of right before which politics must bow the knee,
the politician finds it prudent to have nothing to do with compacts
and rather to deny all reality to morals in this sense, and reduce
all duty to mere benevolence. Philosophy could easily frustrate the
artifices of a politics like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p.
195]</span> this, which shuns the light of criticism, by publishing
its maxims, if only statesmen would have the courage to grant
philosophers the right to ventilate their opinions.</p>
<p>With this end in view, I propose another principle of public
right, which is at once transcendental and affirmative. Its formula
would be as follows:—“All maxims which require publicity, in order
that they may not fail to attain their end, are in agreement both
with right and politics.”</p>
<p>For, if these maxims can only attain the end at which they aim
by being published, they must be in harmony with the universal end
of mankind, which is happiness; and to be in sympathy with this (to
make the people contented with their lot) is the real business of
politics. Now, if this end should be attainable only by publicity, or
in other words, through the removal of all distrust of the maxims of
politics, these must be in harmony with the right of the people; for
a union of the ends of all is only possible in a harmony with this
right.</p>
<p>I must postpone the further development and discussion of this
principle till another opportunity. That it is a transcendental
formula is quite evident from the fact that all the empirical
conditions of a doctrine of happiness, or the <i>matter</i> of law, are
absent, and that it has regard only to the <i>form</i> of universal
conformity to law.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span>*
  *   *</p>
<p>If it is our duty to realise a state of public right, if at the
same time there are good grounds for hope that this ideal may be
realised, although only by an approximation advancing <i>ad infinitum</i>,
then perpetual peace, following hitherto falsely so-called
conclusions of peace, which have been in reality mere cessations of
hostilities, is no mere empty idea. But rather we have here a problem
which gradually works out its own solution and, as the periods in
which a given advance takes place towards the realisation of the
ideal of perpetual peace will, we hope, become with the passing
of time shorter and shorter, we must approach ever nearer to this
goal.</p>

identical with the state of nature, Professor D. G. Ritchie ascribes
to Locke (see <i>Natural Right</i>, Ch. II., p. 42). Locke, he says, “has

and rights of government.” [<i>Civil Government</i>, II., § 111.] A little
confusion on the part of his readers (perhaps in his own mind) makes
it possible to regard the state of nature as itself the golden age,
and the way is prepared for the favourite theory of the eighteenth

of government (<i>Treatise</i>, III., Part II., Sect. VIII.). There
are, he says, American tribes “where men live in concord and amity
among themselves without any established government; and never pay
submission to any of their fellows, except in time of war, when
their captain enjoys a shadow of authority, which he loses after
their return from the field, and the establishment of peace with the
neighbouring tribes. This authority, however, instructs them in the
advantages of government, and teaches them to have recourse to it,
when either by the pillage of war, by commerce, or by any fortuitous
inventions, their riches and possessions have become so considerable
as to make them forget, on every emergence, the interest they have
in the preservation of peace and justice.... Camps are the true
mothers of cities; and as war cannot be administered, by reason of
the suddenness of every exigency, without some authority in a single
person, the same kind of authority naturally takes place in that
civil government, which succeeds the military.”</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_8"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_8" class="pginternal">[8]</a></span> In Aristotle we find the high-water
mark of Greek thinking on this subject. “The object of military
training,” says he, (<i>Politics</i>, Bk. IV. Ch. XIV., Welldon’s
translation—in older editions Bk. VII.) “should be not to enslave
persons who do not deserve slavery, but firstly to secure ourselves
against becoming the slaves of others; secondly, to seek imperial
power not with a view to a universal despotic authority, but for
the benefit of the subjects whom we rule, and thirdly, to exercise
despotic power over those who are deserving to be slaves. That
the legislator should rather make it his object so to order his
legislation upon military and other matters as to promote leisure
and peace is a theory borne out by the facts of history.” ... (<i>loc.
cit.</i> Ch. XV.). “War, as we have remarked several times, has its end
in peace.”</p>
<p class="ti1">Aristotle strongly condemns the Lacedæmonians and
Cretans for regarding war and conquest as the sole ends to which all
law and education should be directed. Also in non-Greek tribes like
the Scythians, Persians, Thracians and Celts he says, only military
power is admired by the people and encouraged by the state. “There
was formerly too a law in Macedonia that any one who had never slain
an enemy should wear the halter about his neck.” Among the Iberians
too, a military people, “it is the custom to set around the tomb of
a deceased warrior a number of obelisks corresponding to the number
of enemies he has killed.... Yet ... it may well appear to be a
startling paradox that it should be the function of a Statesman to
succeed in devising the means of rule and mastery over neighbouring
peoples whether with or against their own will. How can such action
be worthy of a statesman or legislator, when it has not even the
sanction of law?” (<i>op. cit.</i>, IV. Ch. 2.)</p>
<p class="ti1">We see that Aristotle disapproves of a glorification
of war for its own sake, and regards it as justifiable only in
certain circumstances. Methods of warfare adopted and proved in the
East would not have been possible in Greece. An act of treachery, for
example, such as that of Jael, (<i>Judges</i> IV. 17) which was extolled
in songs of praise by the Jews, (<i>loc. cit.</i> V. 24) the Greek
people would have been inclined to repudiate. The stories of Roman
history, the behaviour of Fabricius, for instance, or Regulus and
the honourable conduct of prisoners on various occasions released on
parole, show that this consciousness of certain principles of honour
in warfare was still more highly developed in Rome.</p>
<p class="ti1">Socrates in the <i>Republic</i> (V. 469, 470) gives
expression to a feeling which was gradually gaining ground in Greece,
that war between Hellenic tribes was much more serious than war
between Greeks and barbarians. In such civil warfare, he considered,
the defeated ought not to be reduced to slavery, nor the slain
despoiled, nor Hellenic territory devastated. For any difference
between Greek and Greek is to “be regarded by them as discord only—a
quarrel among friends, which is not to be called war”.... “Our
citizens [<i>i.e.</i> in the ideal republic] should thus deal with their
Hellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with
one another.” (V. 471.)</p>
<p class="ti1">The views of Plato and Aristotle on this and other
questions were in advance of the custom and practice of their
time.</p>

<p id="Footnote_19"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_19" class="pginternal">[19]</a></span> J. A. Farrar, in a pamphlet,
(reprinted from the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, vol. 257, 1884) on <i>War
and Christianity</i>, quotes the following passage from Wycliffe in
which he protests against this blot upon the Church and Christian
professions.—“Friars now say that bishops can fight best of all men,
and that it falleth most properly to them, since they are lords of
all this world. They say Christ bade His disciples sell their coats,
and buy them swords; but whereto, if not to fight? Thus friars make a
great array, and stir up many men to fight. But Christ taught not His
apostles to fight with a sword of iron, but with the sword of God’s
Word, and which standeth in meekness of heart and in the prudence of
man’s tongue.... If man-slaying in others be odious to God, much more
in priests, who should be vicars of Christ.” See also the passage
where Erasmus points out that King David was not permitted to build
a temple to God, because he was a man of blood. “Nolo clericos ullo
sanguine contaminari. Gravis impietas!” (<i>Opera</i>, IX., 370 B.)</p>
<p class="ti1">This question had already been considered by Thomas
Aquinas, who decided that the clergy ought not to be allowed
to fight, because the practices of warfare, although right and
meritorious in themselves, were not in accordance with a holy
calling. (<i>Summa</i>, II. 2: Qu. 40.)</p>
<p class="ti1">Aquinas held that war—excluding private war—is
justifiable in a just cause. So too did Luther, (cf. his pamphlet:
<i>Ob Kriegsleute auch in seligem Stande sein können?</i>) Calvin and
Zwingli, the last of whom died sword in hand.</p>
<p class="ti1">With regard to the question of a fighting clergy,
the passage quoted from Origen (pp. 14, 15, above) has considerable
interest, Origen looks upon the active participation of priests in
warfare as something which everyone would admit to be impossible.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_23"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_23" class="pginternal">[23]</a></span> This came about in two ways. The
Church of Rome discouraged the growth of national sentiment. At the
Reformation the independence and unity of the different nations were
for the first time recognised. That is to say, the Reformation laid
the foundation for a science of international law. But, from another
point of view, it not only made such a code of rules possible, it
made it necessary. The effect of the Reformation was not to diminish
the number of wars in which religious belief could play a part.
Moreover, it displaced the Pope from his former position as arbiter
in Europe without setting up any judicial tribunal in his stead.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_24"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_24" class="pginternal">[24]</a></span> Cf. Cicero: <i>De Officiis</i>, I.
xi. “Belli quidem aequitas sanctissime feciali populi Romani jure
perscripta est.” (See the reference to Lawrence’s comments on this
subject, p. 9 above.)</p>
<p class="ti1">“Wars,” says Cicero, “are to be undertaken for this
end, that we may live in peace without being injured; but when we
obtain the victory, we must preserve those enemies who behaved
without cruelty or inhumanity during the war: for example, our
forefathers received, even as members of their state, the Tuscans,
the Æqui, the Volscians, the Sabines and the Hernici, but utterly
destroyed Carthage and Numantia.... And, while we are bound to
exercise consideration toward those whom we have conquered by force,
so those should be received into our protection who throw themselves
upon the honour of our general, and lay down their arms,” (<i>op.
cit.</i>, I. xi., Bohn’s Translation).... “In engaging in war we ought
to make it appear that we have no other view but peace.” (<i>op. cit.</i>,
I. xxiii.)</p>
<p class="ti1">In fulfilling a treaty we must not sacrifice the
spirit to the letter (<i>De Officiis</i>, I. x). “There are also rights
of war, and the faith of an oath is often to be kept with an enemy.”
(<i>op. cit.</i>, III. xxix.)</p>
<p class="ti1">This is the first statement by a classical writer in
which the idea of justice being due to an enemy appears. Cicero goes
further. Particular states, he says, (<i>De Legibus</i>, I. i.) are only
members of a whole governed by reason.</p>

50-53: pp. 96-101. Grotius wrongly understood “Jus Gentium,” (“a
collection of rules and principles, determined by observation to be
common to the institutions which prevailed among the various Italian
tribes”) to mean “Jus <i>inter</i> gentes.” The Roman expression for
International Law was not “Jus Gentium,” but “Jus Feciale.”</p>
<p class="ti1">“Having adopted from the Antonine jurisconsults,” says
Maine, “the position that the Jus Gentium and the Jus Naturæ were
identical, Grotius, with his immediate predecessors and his immediate
successors, attributed to the Law of Nature an authority which
would never perhaps have been claimed for it, if “Law of Nations”
had not in that age been an ambiguous expression. They laid down
unreservedly that Natural Law is the code of states, and thus put in
operation a process which has continued almost down to our own day,
the process of engrafting on the international system rules which are
supposed to have been evolved from the unassisted contemplation of
the conception of Nature. There is, too, one consequence of immense
practical importance to mankind which, though not unknown during the
early modern history of Europe, was never clearly or universally
acknowledged till the doctrines of the Grotian school had prevailed.
If the society of nations is governed by Natural Law, the atoms
which compose it must be absolutely equal. Men under the sceptre
of Nature are all equal, and accordingly commonwealths are equal
if the international state be one of nature. The proposition that
independent communities, however different in size and power, are
all equal in the view of the Law of Nations, has largely contributed
to the happiness of mankind, though it is constantly threatened by
the political tendencies of each successive age. It is a doctrine
which probably would never have obtained a secure footing at all if
International Law had not been entirely derived from the majestic
claims of Nature by the Publicists who wrote after the revival of
letters.” (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 100.)</p>

in favour of peace—not a permanent peace, that is to say, the idea
of which would scarcely be likely to occur to anyone in the early
years of the seventeenth century—but a plea for fewer, shorter wars.
“If therefore,” he says, “a peace sufficiently safe can be had, it
is not ill secured by the condonation of offenses, and damages, and
expenses: especially among Christians, to whom the Lord has given his
peace as his legacy. And so St. Paul, his best interpreter, exhorts
us to live at peace with all men.... May God write these lessons—He

For the dead, it is true, fight no more. But the living, are of
another mind, and the mightiest among them have little respect for
tribunals.’” This is followed by the ironical suggestion that a
court of arbitration should be established at Rome of which the Pope
should be made president; while at the same time the old spiritual
authority should be restored to the Church, and excommunication be
the punishment of non-compliance with the arbitral decree. “Such
plans,” he adds, “are as likely to succeed as that of M. de St.
Pierre. But as we are allowed to write novels, why should we find
fault with fiction which would bring back the golden age?” But see
also <i>Observations sur le Projet d’une Paix Perpétuelle de M. l’Abbé
de St. Pierre</i> (Dutens, V., esp. p. 56) and the letter to Remond de
Montmort (<i>ibid.</i> pp. 20, 21) where Leibniz considers this project
rather more seriously.</p>

<p id="Footnote_48"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_48" class="pginternal">[48]</a></span> Hobbes realises clearly that
there probably never was such a state of war all over the world nor
a state of nature conforming to a common type. The case is parallel
to the use of the term “original contract” as an explanation of
the manner in which the civil state came to be formed. (Cf. p. 52,
<i>note</i>.)</p>
<p class="ti1">See also Hume (<i>Inquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals,</i> Sect. III. Part I.). “This <i>poetical</i> fiction of the <i>golden
age</i> is, in some respects, of a piece with the <i>philosophical</i>
fiction of the <i>state of nature</i>; only that the former is represented
as the most charming and most peaceable condition, which can possibly
be imagined; whereas the latter is painted out as a state of mutual
war and violence, attended with the most extreme necessity.” This
fiction of a state of nature as a state of war, says Hume, (in a note
to this passage) is not the invention of Hobbes. Plato (<i>Republic</i>,
II. III. IV.) refutes a hypothesis very like it, and Cicero (<i>Pro
Sext.</i> l. 42) regards it as a fact universally acknowledged.</p>
<p class="ti1">Cf. also Spinoza (<i>Tract. Pol.</i> c. ii. § 14): “Homines
ex natura hostes.” And (c. v. § 2): “Homines civiles non nascuntur
sed fiunt.” These expressions are to be understood, says Bluntschli
(<i>Theory of the State</i>, IV. Ch. vi., p. 284, <i>note</i> a), “rather as a
logical statement of what <i>would be</i> the condition of man apart from
civil society, than as distinctly implying a historical theory.”</p>
<p class="ti1">While starting from the same premises, Spinoza
carries Hobbes’ political theories to their logical conclusion. If
we admit that right lies with might, then right is with the people
in any revolution successfully carried out. (But see Hobbes’ Preface
to the <i>Philosophical Rudiments</i> and Kant’s <i>Perpetual Peace</i>, p.
188, <i>note</i>.) Spinoza, in a letter, thus alludes to this point of
difference:—“As regards political theories, the difference which you
inquire about between Hobbes and myself, consists in this, that I
always preserve natural right intact, and only allot to the chief
magistrates in every state a right over their subjects commensurate
with the excess of their power over the power of the subjects. This
is what always takes place in the state of nature.” (Epistle 50,
<i>Works</i>, Bohn’s ed., Vol. II.)</p>

pessimism and absolutism usually go together in the doctrines of
philosophers. He gives as instances Hobbes, Kant and Schopenhauer.</p>
<p class="ti1">Hobbes (<i>On Dominion</i>, Ch. X. 3, <i>seq.</i>) regarded an
absolute monarchy as the only proper form of government, while in the
opinion of Locke, (<i>On Civil Government</i>, II. Ch. VII. §§ 90, 91)
it was no better than a state of nature. Kant would not have gone
quite so far. As a philosopher, he upheld the sovereignty of the
people and rejected a monarchy which was not governed in accordance
with republican principles; as a citizen, he denied the right of
resistance to authority. (Cf. <i>Perpetual Peace</i>, pp. 126, 188,

<p id="Footnote_51"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_51" class="pginternal">[51]</a></span> We find the same rule laid down

hopeless that they may declare war.”</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_52"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_52" class="pginternal">[52]</a></span> Rousseau (<i>Contrat Social</i>: I.
vi.) regards the social contract as tacitly implied in every actual
society: its articles “are the same everywhere, and are everywhere
tacitly admitted and recognised, even though they may never have
found formal expression” in any constitution. In the same way he
speaks of a state of nature “which no longer exists, which perhaps
never has existed.” (Preface to the <i>Discourse on the Causes of
Inequality</i>.) But Rousseau’s interpretation of these terms is, on
the whole, literal in spite of these single passages. He speaks
throughout the <i>Contrat Social</i>, as if history could actually record
the signing and drawing up of such documents. Hobbes, Hooker,
(<i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i>, I. sect. 10—see also Ritchie: <i>Darwin and
Hegel</i>, p. 210 <i>seq.</i>) Hume and Kant use more careful language. “It
cannot be denied,” writes Hume, (<i>Of the Original Contract</i>) “that
all government is, at first, founded on a contract and that the most
ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed chiefly by that
principle. In vain are we asked in what records this charter of our
liberties is registered. It was not written on parchment, nor yet on
leaves or barks of trees. It preceded the use of writing and all the
other civilised arts of life. But we trace it plainly in the nature
of man, and in the equality, or something approaching equality, which
we find in all the individuals of that species.”</p>
<p class="ti1">This fine passage expresses admirably the views of
Kant on this point. Cf. <i>Werke</i>, (Rosenkranz) IX. 160. The original
contract is merely an idea of reason, one of those ideas which we
think into things in order to explain them.</p>
<p class="ti1">Hobbes does not professedly make the contract
historical, but in Locke’s <i>Civil Government</i> (II. Ch. VIII. §
102) there is some attempt made to give it a historical basis.—By
consent all were equal, “till by the same consent they set rulers
over themselves. So that their politic societies all began from a
voluntary union, and the mutual agreement of men freely acting in the
choice of their governors, and forms of government.”</p>
<p class="ti1">Bluntschli points out (<i>Theory of the State</i>, IV.
ix., p. 294 and <i>note</i>) that the same theory of contract on which
Hobbes’ doctrine of an absolute government was based was made the
justification of violent resistance to the government at the time of
the French Revolution. The theory was differently applied by Hobbes,
Locke and Rousseau. According to the first, men leave the “state of
nature” when they surrender their rights to a sovereign, and return
to that state during revolution. But, for Rousseau, this sovereign
authority is the people: a revolution would be only a change of
ministry. (See <i>Cont. Soc.</i>, III. Ch. xviii.) Again Locke holds
revolution to be justifiable in all cases where the governments have
not fulfilled the trust reposed by the people in them. (Cf. Kant’s
<i>Perpetual Peace</i>, p. 188, <i>note</i>).</p>

<p id="Footnote_58"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_58" class="pginternal">[58]</a></span> Isolated passages are sometimes
quoted from Kant in support of a theory that the present treatise
is at least half ironical<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_A" id="FNanchor_A">[A]</a> and that his views on the question of
perpetual peace did not essentially differ from those of Leibniz.
“Even war,” he says, (<i>Kritik d. Urteilskraft</i>, I. Book ii. § 28.)
“when conducted in an orderly way and with reverence for the rights
of citizens has something of the sublime about it, and the more
dangers a nation which wages war in this manner is exposed to and can
courageously overcome, the nobler does its character grow. While, on
the other hand, a prolonged peace usually has the effect of giving
free play to a purely commercial spirit, and side by side with this,
to an ignoble self-seeking, to cowardice and effeminacy; and the
result of this is generally a degradation of national character.”</p>
<p class="ti1">This is certainly an admission that war which does
not violate the Law of Nations has a good side as well as a bad.
We could look for no less in so clear-sighted and unprejudiced a
thinker. Kant would have been the first to admit that under certain
conditions a nation can have no higher duty than to wage war. War
is necessary, but it is in contradiction to reason and the spirit
of right. The “scourge of mankind,” “making more bad men than it
takes away,” the “destroyer of every good,” Kant calls it elsewhere.

<p id="Footnote_69"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_69" class="pginternal">[69]</a></span> A large part of Kant’s
requirements as they are expressed in these Preliminary Articles
has already been fulfilled. The first (Art. 1) is recognised in
theory at least by modern international law. More cannot be said.
A treaty of this kind is of necessity more or less forced by the
stronger on the weaker. The formal ratification of peace in 1871
did not prevent France from longing for the day when she might win
back Alsace-Lorraine and be revenged on Prussia. Not the treaty nor
a consciousness of defeat has kept the peace west of the Rhine, but
a reluctant respect for the fortress of Metz and the mighty army of
united Germany.</p>
<p class="ti1">Articles 2 and 6 are already commonplaces of
international law. Article 2 refers to practices which have not
survived the gradual disappearance of dynastic war. Art. 6 is the
basis of our modern law of war. Art. 3 has been fulfilled in the
literal sense that the standing armies composed of mercenary troops
to which Kant alludes exist no longer. But it is to be feared that
Kant would not think that we have made things much better, nor
regard our present system of progressive armaments as a step in the
direction of perpetual peace. Art. 4 is not likely to be fulfilled in
the near future. It is long since Cobden denounced the institution
of National Debts—an institution which, as Kant points out, owes its
origin to the English, the “commercial people” referred to in the
text. Art. 5 no doubt came to Kant through Vattel. “No nation,” says
the Swiss publicist, (<i>Law of Nations</i>, II. Ch. iv. § 54) “has the
least right to interfere with the government of another,” unless, he
adds, (Ch. v. § 70) in a case of anarchy or where the well-being of
the human race demands it. This is a recognised principle of modern
international law. Intervention is held to be justifiable only where
the obligation to respect another’s freedom of action comes into
conflict with the duty of self-preservation.</p>
<p class="ti1">Puffendorf leaves much more room for the exercise of
benevolence. The natural affinity and kinship between men is, says
he, (<i>Les Devoirs de l’homme et du citoien</i>, II. Ch. xvi. § xi.) “a
sufficient reason to authorise us to take up defence of every person
whom one sees unjustly oppressed, when he implores our aid <i>and when
we can do it conveniently</i>.” (The italics are mine.—[Tr.])</p>

Vattel (<i>op. cit.</i>, II. Ch. viii. §§ 104, 105: Ch. ix. §§ 123, 125).
A sovereign, he says, cannot object to a stranger entering his state
who at the same time respects its laws. No one can be quite deprived
of the right of way which has been handed down from the time when the
whole earth was common to all men.</p>

<p id="Footnote_72"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_72" class="pginternal">[72]</a></span> Kant believed that, in the newly
formed constitution of the United States, his ideal with regard
to the external forms of the state as conforming to the spirit of
justice was most nearly realised. Professor Paulsen draws attention,
in the following passage, to the fact that Kant held the English
government of the eighteenth century in very low esteem. (<i>Kant</i>,
p. 357, <i>note</i>. See Eng. trans., p. 352, <i>note</i>.) It was not the
English state, he says, which furnished Kant with an illustration of
his theory:—“Rather in it he sees a form of despotism only slightly
veiled, not Parliamentary despotism, as some people have thought, but
monarchical despotism. Through bribery of the Commons and the Press,
the King had actually absolute power, as was evident, above all, from
the fact that he had often waged war without, and in defiance of,
the will of the people. Kant has a very unfavourable opinion of the
English state in every way. Among the collected notes written by him
in the last ten years of the century and published by Reicke (<i>Lose
Blätter</i>, I. 129) the following appears:—‘The English nation (<i>gens</i>)
regarded as a people (<i>populus</i>) and looked upon side by side with
other races is, as a collection of individuals, of all mankind the
most highly to be esteemed. But as a state, compared with other
states, it is the most destructive, high-handed and tyrannical, and
the most provocative of war among them all.’”</p>
<p class="ti1">Kuno Fischer (<i>op. cit.</i>, Vol. V., I. Ch. 11, pp. 150,
151) to whom Professor Paulsen’s reference may here perhaps allude,
states that Kant’s objection to the English constitution is that it
was an oligarchy, Parliament being not only a legislative body, but
through its ministers also executive in the interests of the ruling
party or even of private individuals in that party. It seems more
likely that what most offended a keen observer of the course of the
American War of Independence was the arbitrary and ill-directed
power of the king. But see the passage quoted by Fischer (pp. 152,
153) from the <i>Rechtslehre</i> (Part II. Sect. I.) which is, he says,
unmistakeably directed against the English constitution and certain
temporary conditions in the political history of the country.</p>

to realise a universal empire in the past—the Empire of Alexander
the Great, based upon a plan of uniting the races of east and west;
the Roman Empire which sought vainly to stamp its national character
upon mankind; the Frankish Monarchy; the Holy Roman Empire which
fell to pieces through the want of a central power strong enough to
overcome the tendency to separation and nationalisation; and finally

which wrecked the Roman Empire—a neglect of the strength of foreign
national sentiment.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_76"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_76" class="pginternal">[76]</a></span> Reason requires a State of
nations. This is the ideal, and Kant’s proposal of a federation of
states is a practical substitute from which we may work to higher
things. Kant, like Fichte, (<i>Werke</i>, VII. 467) strongly disapproves
of a universal monarchy such as that of which Dante dreamed—a modern
Roman Empire. The force of necessity, he says, will bring nations at
last to become members of a cosmopolitan state, “or if such a state
of universal peace proves (as has often been the case with too great
states) a greater danger to freedom from another point of view, in
that it introduces despotism of the most terrible kind, then this
same necessity must compel the nations to enter a state which indeed
has the form not of a cosmopolitan commonwealth under one sovereign,
but of a federation regulated by legal principles determined by a
common code of international law.” (<i>Das mag in d. Theorie richtig

are convincingly demonstrated in a recent essay by Professor D. G.
Ritchie (<i>Studies in Political and Social Ethics</i>, Sonnenschein,
1902). Professor Ritchie considers in detail a number of concrete
cases which occurred in the century between 1770 and 1870. “Let any
one take the judgments he would pass on these or any similarly varied
cases, and I think he will find that we do not restrict our approval
to wars of self-defence, that we do not approve self-defence under
all circumstances, that there are some cases in which we approve
of absorption of smaller states by larger, that there are cases
in which we excuse intervention of third parties in quarrels with
which at first they had nothing to do, and that we sometimes approve
war even when begun without the authority of any already existing
sovereign. Can any principles be found underlying such judgments? In
the first place we ought not to disguise from ourselves the fact that
our judgments after the result are based largely on success. ... I
think it will be found that our judgments on the wars of the century
from 1770 to 1870 turn very largely on the question, Which of the
conflicting forces was making for constitutional government and for
social progress? or, to put it in wider terms, Which represented the
higher civilisation? And thus it is that we may sometimes approve the
rise of a new state and sometimes the absorption of an old.” (<i>Op.

to offer redress for his behaviour, or oblige him to follow more
wise and equitable maxims.... But (<i>loc. cit.</i> § 56) when the bands
of the political society are broken, or at least suspended, between
the sovereign and his people, the contending parties may then be
considered at two distinct powers; and, since they are both equally
independent of all foreign authority, nobody has a right to judge

</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_115"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_115" class="pginternal">[115]</a></span> It has been hitherto doubted,
not without reason, whether there can be laws of permission (<i>leges
permissivæ</i>) of pure reason as well as commands (<i>leges præceptivæ</i>)
and prohibitions (<i>leges prohibitivæ</i>). For law in general has a
basis of objective practical necessity: permission, on the other
hand, is based upon the contingency of certain actions in practice.
It follows that a law of permission would enforce what cannot be
enforced; and this would involve a contradiction, if the object of
the law should be the same in both cases. Here, however, in the
present case of a law of permission, the presupposed prohibition
is aimed merely at the future manner of acquisition of a right—for
example, acquisition through inheritance: the exemption from this
prohibition (<i>i.e.</i> the permission) refers to the present state of
possession. In the transition from a state of nature to the civil
state, this holding of property can continue as a <i>bona fide</i>, if
usurpatory, ownership, under the new social conditions, in accordance
with a permission of the Law of Nature. Ownership of this kind, as
soon as its true nature becomes known, is seen to be mere nominal
possession (<i>possessio putativa</i>) sanctioned by opinion and customs
in a natural state of society. After the transition stage is passed,
such modes of acquisition are likewise forbidden in the subsequently
evolved civil state: and this power to remain in possession would
not be admitted if the supposed acquisition had taken place in the
civilized community. It would be bound to come to an end as an injury
to the right of others, the moment its illegality became patent.</p>
<p class="ti1">I have wished here only by the way to draw the
attention of teachers of the Law of Nature to the idea of a <i>lex
permissiva</i> which presents itself spontaneously in any system of
rational classification. I do so chiefly because use is often made
of this concept in civil law with reference to statutes; with this
difference, that the law of prohibition stands alone by itself,
while permission is not, as it ought to be, introduced into that
law as a limiting clause, but is thrown among the exceptions.
Thus “this or that is forbidden”,—say, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and so on in
an infinite progression,—while permissions are only added to the
law incidentally: they are not reached by the application of some
principle, but only by groping about among cases which have actually
occurred. Were this not so, qualifications would have had to be
brought into the formula of laws of prohibition which would have
immediately transformed them into laws of permission. Count von
Windischgrätz, a man whose wisdom was equal to his discrimination,
urged this very point in the form of a question propounded by him for
a prize essay. One must therefore regret that this ingenious problem
has been so soon neglected and left unsolved. For the possibility of
a formula similar to those of mathematics is the sole real test of
a legislation that would be consistent. Without this, the so-called
<i>jus certum</i> will remain forever a mere pious wish: we can have only
general laws valid on the whole; no general laws possessing the
universal validity which the concept law seems to demand.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_117"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_117" class="pginternal">[117]</a></span> Hobbes thus describes the
establishment of the state. “A <i>commonwealth</i> is said to be
<i>instituted</i>, when a <i>multitude</i> of men do agree, and <i>covenant,
every one, with every one</i>, that to whatsoever <i>man</i>, or <i>assembly
of men</i>, shall be given by the major part, the <i>right</i> to <i>present</i>
the person of them all, that is to say, to be their <i>representative</i>;
everyone, as well he that <i>voted for it</i>, as he that <i>voted against
it</i>, shall <i>authorize</i> all the actions and judgments, of that man, or
assembly of men, in the same manner, as if they were his own, to the
end, to live peaceably amongst themselves, and be protected against
other men.” (<i>Lev.</i> II. Ch. XVIII.)</p>
<p class="ti1">There is a covenant between them, “as if every man
should say to every man, <i>I authorise and give up my right of
governing myself, to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this
condition, that thou give up thy right to him, and authorize all his
actions in like manner</i>.” (<i>Lev.</i> II. Ch. XVII.) [Tr.]</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_118"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_118" class="pginternal">[118]</a></span> It is usually accepted that a
man may not take hostile steps against any one, unless the latter
has already injured him by act. This is quite accurate, if both are
citizens of a law-governed state. For, in becoming a member of this
community, each gives the other the security he demands against
injury, by means of the supreme authority exercising control over
them both. The individual, however, (or nation) who remains in a mere
state of nature deprives me of this security and does me injury, by
mere proximity. There is perhaps no active (<i>facto</i>) molestation,
but there is a state of lawlessness, (<i>status injustus</i>) which, by
its very existence, offers a continual menace to me. I can therefore
compel him, either to enter into relations with me under which we are
both subject to law, or to withdraw from my neighbourhood. So that
the postulate upon which the following articles are based is:—“All
men who have the power to exert a mutual influence upon one another
must be under a civil government of some kind.”</p>
<p class="ti1">A legal constitution is, according to the nature of
the individuals who compose the state:— </p>
<p class="ti1">(1) A constitution formed in accordance with the right
of citizenship of the individuals who constitute a nation (<i>jus
civitatis</i>). </p>
<p class="ti1">(2) A constitution whose principle is international
law which determines the relations of states (<i>jus gentium</i>). </p>
<p class="ti1">(3) A constitution formed in accordance with
cosmopolitan law, in as far as individuals and states, standing in an
external relation of mutual reaction, may be regarded as citizens of
one world-state (<i>jus cosmopoliticum</i>).

</p> <p class="ti1">This classification is not an arbitrary one, but
is necessary with reference to the idea of perpetual peace. For, if
even one of these units of society were in a position physically
to influence another, while yet remaining a member of a primitive
order of society, then a state of war would be joined with these
primitive conditions; and from this it is our present purpose to free
ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_119"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_119" class="pginternal">[119]</a></span> Lawful, that is to say,

right [<i>Befugniss</i>] “to do whatever one likes, so long as this
does not wrong anyone else.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_B" id="FNanchor_B">[B]</a> For what is this right? It is the
possibility of actions which do not lead to the injury of others. So
the explanation of a “right” would be something like this:—“Freedom
is the possibility of actions which do not injure anyone. A man does
not wrong another—whatever his action—if he does not wrong another”:
which is empty tautology. My external (lawful) freedom is rather to
be explained in this way: it is the right through which I require not
to obey any external laws except those to which I could have given
my consent. In exactly the same way, external (legal) equality in a
state is that relation of the subjects in consequence of which no
individual can legally bind or oblige another to anything, without
at the same time submitting himself to the law which ensures that
he can, in his turn, be bound and obliged in like manner by this
other.</p>
<p class="ti1">The principle of lawful independence requires
no explanation, as it is involved in the general concept of a
constitution. The validity of this hereditary and inalienable right,
which belongs of necessity to mankind, is affirmed and ennobled by
the principle of a lawful relation between man himself and higher
beings, if indeed he believes in such beings. This is so, because he
thinks of himself, in accordance with these very principles, as a
citizen of a transcendental world as well as of the world of sense.
For, as far as my freedom goes, I am bound by no obligation even
with regard to Divine Laws—which are apprehended by me only through
my reason—except in so far as I could have given my assent to them;
for it is through the law of freedom of my own reason that I first
form for myself a concept of a Divine Will. As for the principle of
equality, in so far as it applies to the most sublime being in the
universe next to God—a being I might perhaps figure to myself as a
mighty emanation of the Divine spirit,—there is no reason why, if
I perform my duty in the sphere in which I am placed, as that aeon
does in his, the duty of obedience alone should fall to my share, the
right to command to him. That this principle of equality, (unlike
the principle of freedom), does not apply to our relation to God is
due to the fact that, to this Being alone, the idea of duty does not
belong.</p>
<p class="ti1">As for the right to equality which belongs to
all citizens as subjects, the solution of the problem of the
admissibility of an hereditary nobility hinges on the following
question:—“Does social rank—acknowledged by the state to be higher
in the case of one subject than another—stand above desert, or does
merit take precedence of social standing?” Now it is obvious that,
if high position is combined with good family, it is quite uncertain
whether merit, that is to say, skill and fidelity in office, will
follow as well. This amounts to granting the favoured individual a
commanding position without any question of desert; and to that, the
universal will of the people—expressed in an original contract which
is the fundamental principle of all right—would never consent. For it
does not follow that a nobleman is a man of noble character. In the
case of the official nobility, as one might term the rank of higher
magistracy—which one must acquire by merit—the social position is not
attached like property to the person but to his office, and equality
is not thereby disturbed; for, if a man gives up office, he lays
down with it his official rank and falls back into the rank of his
fellows.</p>

he says here, “like that of individual men, is a condition which
must be abandoned, in order that they may enter a state regulated
by law. Hence, before this can take place, every right possessed
by these nations and every external “mine” and “thine” [<i>id est</i>,
symbol of possession] which states acquire or preserve through
war are merely <i>provisional</i>, and can become <i>peremptorily</i> valid
and constitute a true state of peace only in a universal <i>union
of states</i>, by a process analogous to that through which a people
becomes a state. Since, however, the too great extension of such a
State of nations over vast territories must, in the long run, make
the government of that union—and therefore the protection of each of
its members—impossible, a multitude of such corporations will lead
again to a state of war. So that <i>perpetual peace</i>, the final goal of
international law as a whole, is really an impracticable idea [<i>eine
unausführbare Idee</i>]. The political principles, however, which are
directed towards this end, (that is to say, towards the establishment
of such unions of states as may serve as a continual approximation
to that ideal), are not impracticable; on the contrary, as this
approximation is required by duty and is therefore founded also upon
the rights of men and of states, these principles are, without doubt,

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_134"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_134" class="pginternal">[134]</a></span> In order to call this great
empire by the name which it gives itself—namely, China, not Sina or
a word of similar sound—we have only to look at Georgii: <i>Alphab.
Tibet.</i>, pp. 651-654, particularly <i>note</i> b., below. According to the
observation of Professor Fischer of St. Petersburg, there is really
no particular name which it always goes by: the most usual is the
word <i>Kin</i>, <i>i.e.</i> gold, which the inhabitants of Tibet call <i>Ser</i>.
Hence the emperor is called the king of gold, <i>i.e.</i> the king of the
most splendid country in the world. This word <i>Kin</i> may probably be
<i>Chin</i> in the empire itself, but be pronounced <i>Kin</i> by the Italian
missionaries on account of the gutturals. Thus we see that the
country of the Seres, so often mentioned by the Romans, was China:
the silk, however, was despatched to Europe across Greater Tibet,
probably through Smaller Tibet and Bucharia, through Persia and
then on. This leads to many reflections as to the antiquity of this
wonderful state, as compared with Hindustan, at the time of its union
with Tibet and thence with Japan. On the other hand, the name Sina
or Tschina which is said to be given to this land by neighbouring
peoples leads to nothing.</p>
<p class="ti1">Perhaps we can explain the ancient intercourse of
Europe with Tibet—a fact at no time widely known—by looking at what
Hesychius has preserved on the matter. I refer to the shout, Κουξ
Ομπαξ (<i>Konx Ompax</i>), the cry of the Hierophants in the Eleusinian
mysteries (cf. <i>Travels of Anacharsis the Younger</i>, Part V., p. 447,
<i>seq.</i>). For, according to Georgii <i>Alph. Tibet.</i>, the word <i>Concioa</i>
which bears a striking resemblance to <i>Konx</i> means God. <i>Pak-cio</i>
(<i>ib.</i> p. 520) which might easily be pronounced by the Greeks like
<i>pax</i> means <i>promulgator legis</i>, the divine principle permeating
nature (called also, on p. 177, <i>Cencresi</i>). <i>Om</i>, however, which
La Croze translates by <i>benedictus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> blessed, can when
applied to the Deity mean nothing but beatified (p. 507). Now P.
Franc. Horatius, when he asked the Lhamas of Tibet, as he often did,
what they understood by God (<i>Concioa</i>) always got the answer:—“it
is the assembly of all the saints,” <i>i.e.</i> the assembly of those
blessed ones who have been born again according to the faith of the
Lama and, after many wanderings in changing forms, have at last
returned to God, to Burchane: that is to say, they are beings to
be worshipped, souls which have undergone transmigration (p. 223).
So the mysterious expression <i>Konx Ompax</i> ought probably to mean
the holy (<i>Konx</i>), blessed, (<i>Om</i>) and wise (<i>Pax</i>) supreme Being
pervading the universe, the personification of nature. Its use in the
Greek mysteries probably signified monotheism for the Epoptes, in
distinction from the polytheism of the people, although elsewhere P.
Horatius scented atheism here. How that mysterious word came by way
of Tibet to the Greeks may be explained as above; and, on the other
hand, in this way is made probable an early intercourse of Europe
with China across Tibet, earlier perhaps than the communication
with Hindustan. (There is some difference of opinion as to the
meaning of the words κόγξ ὄμπαξ—according to Liddell and Scott, a
corruption of κόγξ, ὁμοίως πάξ. Kant’s inferences here seem to be
more than far-fetched. Lobeck, in his <i>Aglaophamus</i> (p. 775), gives
a quite different interpretation which has, he says, been approved
by scholars. And Whately (<i>Historic Doubts relative to Napoleon
Bonaparte</i>, 3rd. ed., Postscript) uses Konx Ompax as a pseudonym.

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_135"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_135" class="pginternal">[135]</a></span> In the mechanical system of
nature to which man belongs as a sentient being, there appears, as
the underlying ground of its existence, a certain <i>form</i> which we
cannot make intelligible to ourselves except by thinking into the
physical world the idea of an end preconceived by the Author of
the universe: this predetermination of nature on the part of God
we generally call Divine Providence. In so far as this providence
appears in the origin of the universe, we speak of Providence
as founder of the world (<i>providentia conditrix; semel jussit,
semper parent.</i> Augustine). As it maintains the course of nature,
however, according to universal laws of adaptation to preconceived
ends, [<i>i.e.</i> teleological laws] we call it a ruling providence
(<i>providentia gubernatrix</i>). Further, we name it the guiding
providence (<i>providentia directrix</i>), as it appears in the world for
special ends, which we could not foresee, but suspect only from the
result. Finally, regarding particular events as divine purposes,
we speak no longer of providence, but of dispensation (<i>directio
extraordinaria</i>). As this term, however, really suggests the idea of
miracles, although the events are not spoken of by this name, the
desire to fathom dispensation, as such, is a foolish presumption
in men. For, from one single occurrence, to jump at the conclusion
that there is a particular principle of efficient causes and that
this event is an end and not merely the natural [<i>naturmechanische</i>]
sequence of a design quite unknown to us is absurd and presumptuous,
in however pious and humble a spirit we may speak of it. In the same
way to distinguish between a universal and a particular providence
when regarding it <i>materialiter</i>, in its relation to actual objects
in the world (to say, for instance, that there may be, indeed, a
providence for the preservation of the different species of creation,
but that individuals are left to chance) is false and contradictory.
For providence is called universal for the very reason that no single
thing may be thought of as shut out from its care. Probably the
distinction of two kinds of providence, <i>formaliter</i> or subjectively
considered, had reference to the manner in which its purposes are
fulfilled. So that we have ordinary providence (<i>e.g.</i> the yearly
decay and awakening to new life in nature with change of season) and
what we may call unusual or special providence (<i>e.g.</i> the bringing
of timber by ocean currents to Arctic shores where it does not
grow, and where without this aid the inhabitants could not live).
Here, although we can quite well explain the physico-mechanical
cause of these phenomena—in this case, for example, the banks of
the rivers in temperate countries are over-grown with trees, some
of which fall into the water and are carried along, probably by
the Gulf Stream—we must not overlook the teleological cause which
points to the providential care of a ruling wisdom above nature.
But the concept, commonly used in the schools of philosophy, of a
co-operation on the part of the Deity or a concurrence (<i>concursus</i>)
in the operations going on in the world of sense, must be dropped.
For it is, firstly, self-contradictory to couple the like and the
unlike together (<i>gryphes jungere equis</i>) and to let Him who is
Himself the entire cause of the changes in the universe make good
any shortcomings in His own predetermining providence (which to
require this must be defective) during the course of the world; for
example, to say that the physician has restored the sick with the
help of God—that is to say that He has been present as a support. For
<i>causa solitaria non juvat</i>. God created the physician as well as his
means of healing; and we must ascribe the result wholly to Him, if
we will go back to the supreme First Cause which, theoretically, is
beyond our comprehension. Or we can ascribe the result entirely to
the physician, in so far as we follow up this event, as explicable
in the chain of physical causes, according to the order of nature.
Secondly, moreover, such a way of looking at this question destroys
all the fixed principles by which we judge an effect. But, from
the ethico-practical point of view which looks entirely to the
transcendental side of things, the idea of a divine concurrence is
quite proper and even necessary: for example, in the faith that God
will make good the imperfection of our human justice, if only our
feelings and intentions are sincere; and that He will do this by
means beyond our comprehension, and therefore we should not slacken
our efforts after what is good. Whence it follows, as a matter of
course, that no one must attempt to explain a good action as a mere
event in time by this <i>concursus</i>; for that would be to pretend a
theoretical knowledge of the supersensible and hence be absurd.</p>

(<i>op. cit.</i>, II. Ch. 6):—“All lawful governments are republican.”
And in a footnote to this passage:—“I do not by the word ‘republic’
mean an aristocracy or democracy only, but in general all governments
directed by the public will which is the law. If a government is to
be lawful, it must not be confused with the sovereign power, but be
considered as the administrator of that power: and then monarchy
itself is a republic.” This language has a close affinity with that
used by Kant. (Cf. above, <a href="#Page_126" class="pginternal">p. 126</a>.) [Tr.]</p>

<p id="Footnote_144"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_144" class="pginternal">[144]</a></span> Difference of religion! A
strange expression, as if one were to speak of different kinds
of morality. There may indeed be different historical forms of
belief,—that is to say, the various means which have been used in
the course of time to promote religion,—but they are mere subjects
of learned investigation, and do not really lie within the sphere
of religion. In the same way there are many religious works—the
<i>Zendavesta</i>, <i>Veda</i>, <i>Koran</i> etc.—but there is only one religion,
binding for all men and for all times. These books are each no more
than the accidental mouthpiece of religion, and may be different
according to differences in time and place.</p>

<p id="Footnote_145"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_145" class="pginternal">[145]</a></span> Montesquieu speaks thus in
praise of the English state:—“As the enjoyment of liberty, and even
its support and preservation, consists in every man’s being allowed
to speak his thoughts and to lay open his sentiments, a citizen in
this state will say or write whatever the laws do not expressly
forbid to be said or written.” (<i>Esprit des Lois</i>, XIX. Ch. 27.)

to freedom as a source of danger to the state. [Tr.]</p>

<p id="Footnote_146"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_146" class="pginternal">[146]</a></span> Kant is thinking here not of
the sword of justice, in the moral sense, but of a sword which is
symbolical of the executive power of the actual law. [Tr.]</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_147"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_147" class="pginternal">[147]</a></span> Cf. Aristotle: <i>Politics</i>,
(Welldon’s trans.) IV. Ch. XIV. “The same principles of morality are
best both for individuals and States.”</p>
<p class="ti1">Among the ancients the connection between politics
and morals was never questioned, although there were differences of
opinion as to which science stood first in importance. Thus, while
Plato put politics second to morals, Aristotle regarded politics as
the chief science and ethics as a part of politics. This connection
between the sciences was denied by Machiavelli, who lays down the
dictum that, in the relations of sovereigns and states, the ordinary
rules of morality do not apply. See <i>The Prince</i>, Ch. XVIII. “A
Prince,” he says, “and most of all a new Prince, cannot observe all
those rules of conduct in respect of which men are accounted good,
being frequently obliged, in order to preserve his Princedom, to act
in opposition to good faith, charity, humanity, and religion. He must
therefore keep his mind ready to shift as the winds and tides of
Fortune turn, and, as I have already said, he ought not to quit good
courses if he can help it, but should know how to follow evil courses
if he must.”</p>
<p class="ti1">Hume thought that laxer principles might be allowed
to govern states than private persons, because intercourse between
them was not so “necessary and advantageous” as between individuals.
“There is a system of morals,” he says, “calculated for princes,
much more free than that which ought to govern private persons,”
(<i>Treatise</i>, III., Part II., Sect. IX.) [Tr.]</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_148"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_148" class="pginternal">[148]</a></span> These are <i>permissive</i> laws
of reason which allow us to leave a system of public law, when it
is tainted by injustice, to remain just as it is, until everything
is entirely revolutionised through an internal development, either
spontaneous, or fostered and matured by peaceful influences. For
any legal constitution whatsoever, even although it conforms only
slightly with the spirit of law is better than none at all—that is
to say, anarchy, which is the fate of a precipitate reform. Hence,
as things now are, the wise politician will look upon it as his duty
to make reforms on the lines marked out by the ideal of public law.
He will not use revolutions, when these have been brought about by
natural causes, to extenuate still greater oppression than caused
them, but will regard them as the voice of nature, calling upon him
to make such thorough reforms as will bring about the only lasting
constitution, a lawful constitution based on the principles of
freedom.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_149"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_149" class="pginternal">[149]</a></span> It is still sometimes
denied that we find, in members of a civilised community, a
certain depravity rooted in the nature of man;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_C" id="FNanchor_C">[C]</a> and it might, indeed,
be alleged with some show of truth that not an innate corruptness
in human nature, but the barbarism of men, the defect of a not yet
sufficiently developed culture, is the cause of the evident antipathy
to law which their attitude indicates. In the external relations of
states, however, human wickedness shows itself incontestably, without
any attempt at concealment. Within the state, it is covered over by
the compelling authority of civil laws. For, working against the
tendency every citizen has to commit acts of violence against his
neighbour, there is the much stronger force of the government which
not only gives an appearance of morality to the whole state (<i>causae
non causae</i>), but, by checking the outbreak of lawless propensities,
actually aids the moral qualities of men considerably, in their
development of a direct respect for the law. For every individual
thinks that he himself would hold the idea of right sacred and
follow faithfully what it prescribes, if only he could expect that
everyone else would do the same. This guarantee is in part given
to him by the government; and a great advance is made by this step
which is not deliberately moral, towards the ideal of fidelity to
the concept of duty for its own sake without thought of return. As,
however, every man’s good opinion of himself presupposes an evil
disposition in everyone else, we have an expression of their mutual
judgment of one another, namely, that when it comes to hard facts,
none of them are worth much; but whence this judgment comes remains
unexplained, as we cannot lay the blame on the nature of man, since
he is a being in the possession of freedom. The respect for the idea
of right, of which it is absolutely impossible for man to divest
himself, sanctions in the most solemn manner the theory of our power
to conform to its dictates. And hence every man sees himself obliged
to act in accordance with what the idea of right prescribes, whether
his neighbours fulfil their obligation or not.</p>
<p class="p1" id="Footnote_C"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_C" class="pginternal">[C]</a></span> This depravity of human nature
is denied by Rousseau, who held that the mind of man was naturally
inclined to virtue, and that good civil and social institutions
are all that is required. (<i>Discourse on the Sciences and Arts</i>,
1750.) Kant here takes sides with Hobbes against Rousseau. See
Kant’s <i>Theory of Ethics</i>, Abbott’s trans. (4th ed., 1889), p. 339
<i>seq.</i>—esp. p. 341 and <i>note</i>. Cf. also Hooker’s <i>Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>, I. § 10:—“Laws politic, ordained for external order and
regiment amongst men, are never framed as they should be, unless
presuming the will of man to be inwardly obstinate, rebellious,
and averse from all obedience to the sacred laws of his nature;
in a word, unless presuming man to be, in regard of his depraved
mind, little better than a wild beast, they do accordingly provide,
notwithstanding, so to frame his outward actions, that they be no
hindrance unto the common good, for which societies are instituted.”

<div class="footnote">
<p id="Footnote_153"><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_153" class="pginternal">[153]</a></span> “When a king has dethroned
himself,” says Locke, (<i>On Civil Government</i>, Ch. XIX. § 239) “and
put himself in a state of war with his people, what shall hinder them
from prosecuting him who is no king, as they would any other man, who
has put himself into a state of war with them?” ... “The legislative
being only a fiduciary power to act for certain ends, there remains
still <i>in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the
legislative</i>.” (<i>Op. cit.</i>, Ch. XIII. § 149.) And again, (<i>op. cit.</i>,
Ch. XI. § 134.) we find the words, “... over whom [<i>i.e.</i> society] no
body can have a power to make laws, but by their own consent, and by
authority received from them.” Cf. also Ch. XIX. § 228 <i>seq.</i></p>
<p class="ti1">Hobbes represents the opposite point of view. “How
many kings,” he wrote, (Preface to the <i>Philosophical Rudiments
concerning Government and Society</i>) “and those good men too, hath
this one error, that a tyrant king might lawfully be put to death,
been the slaughter of! How many throats hath this false position cut,
that a prince for some causes may by some certain men be deposed! And
what bloodshed hath not this erroneous doctrine caused, that kings
are not superiors to, but administrators for the multitude!” This
“erroneous doctrine” Kant received from Locke through Rousseau. He
advocated, or at least practised as a citizen, a doctrine of passive
obedience to the state. A free press, he held, offered the only
lawful outlet for protest against tyranny. But, in theory, he was an
enemy to absolute monarchy. [Tr.]</p>

Connection of Morals with Politics</i>, 1788. This worthy scholar
confesses at the very beginning that he is unable to give a
satisfactory answer to this question. But his sanction of such
maxims, even when coupled with the admission that he cannot
altogether clear away the arguments raised against them, seems to
be a greater concession in favour of those who shew considerable
inclination to abuse them, than it might perhaps be wise to admit.</p>

</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
