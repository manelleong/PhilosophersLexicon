dao de jing by lao zi
 
a minimalist translation
 
by bruce r linnell phd
 

 


welcome to yet another translation of the dao de jing ddj

or tao te ching in the oldfashioned spelling  why should you want to read

this translation  this version attempts to include an exact translation

of every chinese symbol in the original text with as few added words and

paraphrasing as possible  this results in sentences which hopefully

provide a more literal translation but are bare and minimalist sometimes

awkward and often doesnt make sense  you the reader will have to

wrestle with some sentences trying to wring out of them whatever meaning their

author was trying to express  years ago instead of my simply telling you

what i think they mean  i also show you what words were translated

exactly what was interpreted and what was added or left out so you can see

exactly how much the english translation has in common with the original

chinese  i even point out alternative translations so you can choose for

yourself in some cases  
 
another difference is that while this translation is

primarily based on the wang bi ancient manuscript used by most translators

it presents some of the ideas from the earliest versions of the ddj we have

available if those ideas are present in the majority of all the sources
 
finally scholars have long speculated that different parts

of the ddj were written by different authors at different times  by

analyzing the symbols phrases and themes in each chapter the chapters can be

separated into at least three groups  the appendix presents the chapters

in these groups so that the reader may better see the common themes each group

focused on

 
who wrote the ddj

and when
 
there is a great deal of debate over these questions enough

to fill a book in their own right  what follows is just a very brief

introduction for the firsttime reader who has no idea who lao zi was please

note that all dates are very approximate
 
although the author of the ddj is always given as lao zi

or lao tsu old spelling we have no historical proof of his

existence  a chinese court historian named sima qian who lived around

 bce wrote a biography of lao zi literally old master unless lao is a

family name  in which case master lao that presents three different

possible traditions although the accuracy of any of them is

doubtful  the first says that lao zi was a contemporary of confucius 

bce  his family name was li plum his given name was er ear and

he was posthumously called dan long ear he was an official in the imperial

archives but when the zhou dynasty began to decline he decided to leave

china  when he reached the northwest border of china the border guard

asked him to write down his teachings which resulted in a document of about

 characters in two sections  later in the same document sima qian

also speculates that lao zi may or may not have been lao dan old long ear

an advisor to duke xian  bce  finally sima qian says that a man

named lao laizi old returning master authored a daoist book that had 

parts was born in the same province as lao zi and also was a contemporary of

confucius  these three accounts are further complicated by reported

meetings between confucius and someone called lao dan in various confucian

texts
 
references to the ddj by other ancient chinese writers

indicate that at least some parts of the ddj were in existence by  bce and

it was being referred to extensively by  bce  one linguistic analysis

of the rhyme schemes indicates that it may have originated as early as  bce

and if the ddj contains the written version of earlier oral traditions these

rhymes may reflect its oldest origins because rhymes are easier to

memorize  other references and linguistic analyses place its beginnings

around perhaps  bce and the earliest known written portions of it

described in the next section date to about  bce  
 
so some parts of the ddj seem to have first appeared in

written form between roughly  bce although its roots could be much

older  it certainly existed in some version of its finished form roughly

 characters in  chapters by  bce  
 
there is also debate on whether the text represents the work

of mostly one author or was added to by different authors over the course of

about a century or was later compiled from different traditions by one

person  
 
the most recent versions of the ddj are separated into 

chapters and two major parts  the first part consisting of chapters

 primarily discusses dao while chapters  primarily discuss de 

ancient authors referring to the ddj also speak of versions that are divided

into   or  chapters

 
different versions

of the ddj
 
there are at least six different ancient sources of the text

all dates are approximate 
 
guodian guo  discovered in  and written around 

bce or slightly earlier this version matches only about  chapters of the

later versions of the ddj and its chapters are ordered completely differently

than the later versions  the chinese symbols are so ancient that scholars

disagree on what modern symbols they should correspond to and there are

occasional spots on the originals where the characters can no longer be

read  
 
mawangdui mwd  discovered in  there are two

slightly different versions a and b obviously written by two different

people dating to about  bce and  bce respectively  while all 

chapters are present both versions reverse the two major parts dao and

de compared to later versions  in addition the order of a few of the

chapters within the parts is different as is the order of some sections within

the chapters  the chinese symbols are also so ancient that scholars

disagree on what modern symbols they should correspond to and there are many

spots where the characters cannot be read  
 
fu yi fy  fu yi was a scholar who lived around  ce

and claimed that the version he presents and discusses was found in a grave

that from his description could possibly be dated to around  bce
 
wang bi wb  written around  ce this is the

standard version that most translators use although there are several

slightly different variations of it
 
he shang gong hsg  a legendary and possibly mythical

person who may have lived around  bce but the work which presents and

discusses the version of the ddj associated with him is not mentioned by others

until  ce  many scholars think this version was probably written

closer to  ce and attributed to he shang gong to give it authority 

there are also many slightly different variations of this text available
 
in comparing the six sources it is easy to see the changes

in philosophy of the early daoists over the centuries  in general the

three earliest versions guo mwda mwdb moreorless agree with each other

the three later versions fy wb hsg moreorless agree with each other

despite the tentative dating of fy to  bce the two groups are often

slightly different from each other and occasionally very different 

however fy does sometimes agree with the three earlier versions  only

the later versions contain the vast majority of criticisms of confucianism

although even guo has a few
 
wb hsg and fy were chosen as sources for this translation

mainly because their earliest manuscripts are complete and the chinese

characters are modern enough that there is less doubt as to their

meaning  but there are occasional differences between them so a 

majority vote was used to determine which symbol to use  this would

result in a document which is essentially the same as wb since wb and hsg are

almost always the same  however in comparing all six sources or

fewer if the chapter is not in guo or the earlier symbols cannot be read it

becomes obvious that sometimes significant changes were made only in the most

recent sources  thus a symbol was changed to the one used by the older

sources if the majority of all available sources use the different

symbol and it adds to the understanding of the sentence  in the case of

a tie the more recent symbol was used  these rules were used for adding

or deleting symbols as well

the translation

process
 
there are many reasons why translations differ besides the

problems inherent in translating from a language where  each symbol represents

a word that has multiple sometimes very different meanings tenses articles

and plurals are not indicated and one symbol can represent either a noun or

adjective another a verb or adverb another all four
 

what source is used  for wb and hsg which version of

     what source in the oldest sources what modern symbols to use
accurately knowing all the possible english meanings for

     each symbol and sometimes pairs of symbols including changes in meaning

     over the millennia and understanding ancient idioms
having to pick just one meaning for each symbol
organizing each sentence into something that makes sense

     which is helped by understanding something of ancient chinese grammar

 
the cultural background knowledge biases beliefs and

agenda of the translator affect every step but the first  agenda refers

to how the translator approaches the content of the ddj  as a work of

mysticism vs philosophy vs military strategy vs advice to emperors etc
 
the goals for this translation were  

include an english word or

     phrase for every chinese symbol in the sentence
use exact translations of the

     chinese symbols wherever possible
minimal interpretation of

     individual symbols only where needed for clarity
use the same english words

     for the same symbols when appropriate
as few added english words as

     possible to make it a correct english sentence
no interpretation of the final

     translated sentence

 
individual symbols are

interpreted only when they either dont make as much sense literally or the

resulting sentence would be awkward in english  in some cases if a

symbol means two english words that both seem to fit equally well they are

combined into one phrase such as heartmind for  see the

next section or 

which can mean mystery profound deep or dark and is consistently translated

as deep and mysterious or deep mystery depending on the context
 
the above goals hopefully help minimize but cannot

eliminate translator bias  the problem is that each chinese symbol still

has several meanings and the translator must pick just one for each symbol

step  to create an english sentence that makes sense step   it is

impossible to avoid translator bias here because the translator must choose

what makes sense or feels right to them in both word meanings and overall

grammar
 
for example there is a line in

chapter         

where  can mean

good fortune or happiness and 

can mean misfortune or disaster but by reflection with  could also be interpreted as

unhappiness  

can mean lean on rely on or depend on so all of these are valid

translations  
misfortune is that which good

fortune leans on
misfortune is that which good

fortune relies on
misfortune is that which good

fortune depends on
unhappiness is that which happiness

leans on
unhappiness is that which happiness

relies on
unhappiness is that which happiness

depends on
 
beyond the differences between using fortune less

personal  what happens to you versus happiness more personal  how you

feel there are also subtle differences  saying that one relies on the

other is different than saying that they mutually support each other as

possibly indicated by the sentence following this one not shown

here    
 
unlike the previous example

where the different translations for each symbol are moreorless related

sometimes the choice the translator makes can affect the overall meaning or

even the emotional impact of the sentence  in chapter  there is a line

     in which the last symbol can be variously

translated into 
i alone seem

lost                   


i alone seem to have lost

everything
i alone seem to have been left

behind           
i alone seem to be forgotten
each of which says a completely

different thing
 
and in chapter  there is a

line       

where the first symbol can mean any of  sin crime vice or fault so

ignoring options for the other symbols all of these are valid  
there is no sin greater than the

capacity for desire
there is no crime greater than the

capacity for desire
there is no vice greater than the

capacity for desire
there is no fault greater than the

capacity for desire
sin of course has very negative religious connotations in

the west while crime and vice also have stronger negative associations

than fault  
 
but there are other even more

significant ways in which the translators choices affect the result 

because of the many sometimes unrelated possible meanings of each chinese

symbol it is possible to come up with multiple translations of the exact same

sentence that are completely different in meaning  for example in

chapter  there is a line     

where  can mean both

region and square while 

can be border or corner so both of these are valid translations  
the greatest region is without

borders
the greatest square is without

corners
 
and in chapter       where  can be skillful or clever and  can mean stupid or

clumsy both of these are equally likely  
great skillfulness seems clumsy
great cleverness seems stupid
 
finally even when there is no

ambiguity about the meaning of the individual symbols it sometimes hard to determine

what overall meaning was intended  from chapter  there is a line        in

which the first four symbols literally mean words of dao but does this mean

talking about dao or the words that come out of dao  it can be argued

both ways due to subtleties in the meanings of the symbols but there is a

tremendous difference in meaning between the two translations
 
in addition there are a few symbols whose modern english

meanings just dont make sense within the context of the sentence probably due

either to transcription errors or changes in meaning over the millennia 

the english words used for these symbols are usually selected according to

context
 

 
common terms
 
because the translation itself is meant to involve minimal

interpretation and explanation some of the words and phrases that are used

repeatedly need to be discussed beforehand for clarity  keep in mind that

volumes have been written about some of these concepts  these are just brief

summaries for the reader new to daoism
 
 dao  most often translated as the

way according to various passages in the ddj dao appears to be the way of

nature or the universe the process of being in harmony with that way the

source that creates and nourishes all things and absolute ultimate reality

itself and according to the opening lines of the first chapter this

description is completely inadequate it is left untranslated so that readers

may fill in the blank for themselves as they read the dao is used as

little as possible because in english that implies that dao is more of a thing

than a process dao is sometimes referred to as it to avoid awkward grammar

or if it was written that way in the original chinese but do not think of

dao as a noun just for fun sometime try reading dao as daoing one

exception is when dao of is used for example the dao of heaven  this

seems to be literally referring to the way heaven does things so it is translated

as the way of heaven but way is capitalized to remind the reader that this

is also dao similarly this dao seems to be referring more to this way

of following dao and is translated this way
 
 de  most

often translated as virtue integrity or inner power de is described

in chapter  as goodness or virtue and honesty or trust de might be

infused into things when they are created byfrom dao or something that

develops when dao is fully expressed through a person de seems to be both the

quality of being virtuous and the power that comes from being virtuous so it

might best be thought of as the power of ones virtue or the power from

ones integrity but it is also left untranslated so that readers may fill in

the blank for themselves as they read
 
 heaven  a complex concept this

symbol seems to have connotations of the sky nature including people and

societies that which controls our destinies as well as possibly that of a

celestial godlike spirit andor perhaps ancestral spirits
 
  heaven and earth 

everything the universe all that is
 
  the

world  literally heaven under it is perhaps better thought of as all

things under heaven it is left as the world because the english grammar

sometimes gets awkward using the more accurate phrase some translate it as

the empire which gives the entire document a much more imperialistic and

militaristic slant
 
  ten thousand creatures 

ten thousand as used here does not refer to a specific number but means

innumerable or myriad together the symbols are perhaps better thought of

as all creatures and things 
 
  sage  literally holy

man in the ddj a sage is anyone who fully embodies and expresses dao and de

as the ruling class would have been one of the few literate groups in ancient

chinese culture reading the ddj it seems possible that references to the way

the sage does things could have also been a subtle way of saying this is what

a wise ruler would do especially in chapters like   and  where

the sage seems to be the ruler
 
 everconstant  while this is

often translated as eternal it probably had more of a sense of constant or

permanent in ancient china unfortunately constant doesnt imply the

enduring nature of permanent nor does permanent imply the unchanging

quality of constant so everconstant is used here
 
 heartmind  usually translated as

either heart or mind the symbol means both heartmind seems to be the

best translation
 
  naturally so  this has

the connotation of something that happens spontaneously without being forced

of itself of its own accord on its own dao is naturally so and although

the ddj does not say so explicitly presumably the sage acts naturally so as

well
 
 uncarved block of wood  just as

a block of wood can be carved into virtually anything in the ddj the uncarved

block represents the limitless undefined potential of our original nature
 
  nonaction  not

passivity or lack of action but spontaneous action taken at the proper time

according to the situation
 
  noninterference

 to change the natural order of things as little as possible in achieving your

goals
 
  withoutknowledge

 not an absence of knowledge but a kind of understanding that does not resort

to preconceived ideas or rules
  withoutname  a

reminder that things concepts and experiences are far more than the names we give

them and ultimately cannot be described with words in contrast to the

confucians whose goal was to find the correct name for everything
 
  withoutdesire  not a

total lack of desire but desires that do not control us or our happiness a sort

of spontaneous unattached desire
 
 or   nonbeing  the

nameless absolute that is the source of all existence being
 
 strive  to struggle or make

vigorous effort to achieve something perhaps competing against others to get

it the opposite of nonaction
 
 yin  the feminine principle

receptive yielding dark cool soft
 
 yang  the masculine principle

aggressive active light warm hard
 
 qi chi

chi  vitality life energy life force vital energy
 
 virtue  the

traditional sense of moral virtue and  goodness
 
 stillness  a mentalemotional

stillness of the heartmind
 
 valley  the image of the valley

is often used in the ddj a valley represents receptiveness because it accepts

all things that come into it openness and emptiness and so is feminine in

nature
 
 self  often translated as body

by others it can mean either it is my personal bias that this symbol seems

to consistently refer to the senseofself personality or ego
 
 or  or   or  returning  the ddj uses four

different symbols to refer to the concept of returning and it is used many

times beyond the everyday meaning in the ddj creatures and people often

return to their source true nature or original state of pure and unformed

potential sometimes they just return and from where or to where is not

specified 
 
 insight  an intuitive

withoutknowledge understanding of what is this is another personal bias 

while the literal translations include wise clear understanding

perceptive and sight it seems that this symbol can be consistently

interpreted as insight which is in agreement with the literal translations

in addition it is variously translated by other modern translators as enlightenment

and even insight
 
 duties 

ones personal and business affairs responsibilities etc
 
 i  on the

rare occasions this is used think of this as someone who is a sagelike daoist

rather than merely the author
 
  

families  in ancient times this phrase referred to the entire ruling class
 
 scholar  around the time of the

ddj this referred to the elite intellectual class of  chinese society

the teachers and philosophers confucius would have been considered a scholar
 
 ruler  king etc  there are many

symbols and euphemisms for various members of the nobility nobles

superiors master of the people son of heaven master of 

chariots etc
 
 high rank  any position of power

or admiration
 
while the ddj is over  years old its wisdom is still

applicable today but dont be fooled by the ancient wording  

king could today apply to anyone who runs things manages others or leads

any kind of group from the nations leader to a corporation ceo toyour boss

and high rank could apply to government officials billionaires or even

movie stars
 
 
there are also many confucian terms used in the ddj 
 
 kindness  being benevolent

kindhearted humane
 righteousness

translated as morality to avoid religious associations  having a sense of

justice doing 
     the right thing being morally

upright
 propriety  ritual courtesy and

formality proper etiquette
 wise wisdom 

as it says
 truth trust

honest  as it says
 loyalty  as it

says
 courage brave

 as it says
 honorable  having a sense of

honor or integrity incorruptibility
 filial piety translated as

devoted children  respect your elders and parents duty to your parents

care 
     for the

elderly
 compassion 

benevolence mercy as specifically applied to parents attitude towards their

children this is 
     translated as loving parents
  noble man  literally

son of the ruler this can mean nobleman one who belongs to the nobility


     but is also a confucian term that

means one who is noble or moral in character and embodies the above 
     qualities sometimes translated by

others as gentleman or superior man
 
 
many symbols in the ddj are used to provide emphasis

similar to an exclamation point in english and can either come at the end of

a sentence or can be used to emphasize a word or phrase in the middle of a

sentence  many translators ignore these latter symbols entirely while

others preface the emphasized word with so such very oh

etc  here an exclamation point is used immediately after the word but

then the sentence continues on  one symbol in particular implies that what

precedes it is not only true but has always been true which is translated as

indeed

notes
a

      literally means highest superior which is also a

  euphemism for the emperor and so is extrapolated to rulers in general
b  in other words he

  does not offer them lightly or often this line is very difficult to

  translate because wb uses a unique first symbol while hsgfy and

  guomwdb each use different symbols however the two earlier symbols

  can both mean to scheme thus making a  majority in meaning the rest of

  the sentence is so terse that it can be translated in numerous ways as well

notes
by looking at all the

  sources it is easy to see that this chapter grew more anticonfucian over

  time
a  the mwd texts use

  knowledge a nonconfucian term instead of wisdom this whole sentence

  is absent in guo
b  this symbol could also

  be interpreted as hypocrisy pretense lying dishonesty etc

notes
this chapter seems to be

  the sagelike author poking fun at himself describing how he appears

  to ordinary people who dont understand him the verys scattered throughout the chapter are implied by

  repeated symbols only the first  lines are present in guo
a  many people over the

  centuries have suggested that this line should be the last in  for many

  good reasons however there is an explicit endofchapter marker in guo at

  the end of  which is not even followed by  in its  manuscript

  so this line does indeed seem to belong here
b  formal versus informal

  respectively
c  according to lau

  the tai lao sacrifice was a major feast where sheep pigs and ox were

  ritually sacrificed and eaten
d  in ancient china

  terraces were manmade hills with paths cut into in their sides leading up

  to a plateau at the top from which to view the surrounding landscape
e  only wb changed seem

  to confused thus making very confused keeping with all the other

  verys
f  drift comes from hsg

  and fy while they use different symbols they have the same meaning thus

  making a majority the symbol in wb means wind and so is incorporated

  into the added phrase the i is added at the beginning to maintain the

  ithey alternation

notes
the first three lines are

a  wb and hsgs use of

  indifferent seems the most neutral but the three earliest sources

  technically have the majority with reverent while fy has peaceful
b

   this line comes from the mwds and guo the later sources are very

  different and do not agree with each other regardless of the source this

  line and the next can be translated many different ways due to the multiple

  meanings of  pleased beautiful good and whether or

  not one assumes that weapons are still being talked about
c  ames and hall point

  out that ancient chinese custom puts the place of honor on the left in happy

  events and on the right in sorrowful events thus in war the supreme

  general sits on the right acknowledging that war is a sorrowful event just

  like a funeral

notes
this chapter is

  anticonfucian as early as mwdb
a  he does not lose de

  in that he is always trying to show that he has de
b  coerces is the same

  symbol as acts but is used here to emphasize that it is the opposite of

  nonaction
c  this line varies

  greatly between all the sources and there is no majority this comes from fy

  as it seems to make the most sense
d  this could also mean future
knowledge and so is often translated as foreknowledge

  prescience etc
e  fruit provides

  nourishment whereas a flower is merely showy
f  compare to  and 

  where living for the substance is apparently a bad thing
g  presumably

  appearance and the flower vs substance and the fruit respectively

  or one who agrees with a particular way of looking at things
b  this phrase can also be

  interpreted as  possibly referring to the  limbs and  openings of the

  human body but when using  in  then the first five lines discuss  out

  of  people and the remaining lines seem to talk about the tenth presumably

  sagelike person
c  there are many

  different interpretations of this phrase and the entire sentence presumably

  the place of death is the end destination of the journey of life as opposed

  to a literal location a more modern interpretation of the symbols is the

  point of death while the symbols for this sentence come from wb and

  hsg and are technically a minority the phrasing they use here matches that

  in the third line following 
d  compare to  where

  living for the substance is apparently a good thing and  where it is a

  bad thing
e  compare to  where

  the sage gathers in the world the last part of this sentence could also be

  translated as he who has virtue and takes in life

notes
a  compare this line to

  the first two lines of the previous chapter and it is easy to see why there

  has long been speculation that this line should end the previous chapter

  however there is an explicit endofchapter marker in guo  and guo does

  not even contain this chapter essentially this line is saying it is easy

  to ruin a small fish by overcooking and it is easy to ruin a nation by

  overcontrolling
b  first  the it is

  literal presumably meaning the worlds ghosts second  ghosts is

  the most literal general term but this could also be referring to demons

  or possibly to souls of the ancestors third  spirit might be better

  thought of in this chapter as spiritual power thus this line seems to

  be saying that ghosts do not have any power in the world this and the

  next few lines can be translated in many different ways due to the multiple

  meanings of the symbols for ghost and spirit and the lack of any

  reasonable context  perhaps these lines were addressing some lost ancient

  scholarly debate or common cultural belief

a great nation is like the

the merging place of the

the female of the world
 
the female always uses

  stillness to conquer the male
by using stillness she

  becomes lowerthan
 
therefore  if a great

  nation is lowerthan a small nation
then it takes hold of the

  small nation
if a small nation is

  lowerthan a great nation
then it is taken hold of by

  the great nation
 
therefore  sometimes one

  is great
           

  and does not seem to be like anything else
           

  now  only because it is great therefore it

  does 
                 

  not seem to be like anything else
           

  if it was like anything else
           

  long ago  it would have become insignificant 
   

                indeed
wb also switched from

  saying the sage is great to dao is great in  also note that here it is

  everyone else not the sage who says the sage is great
b

   see  for many examples of how the sage is not like everyone else this

  and the next three lines are translated in many different ways because  seem resemble sounds the same as a different

  symbol meaning small and so is sometimes interpreted that way and because   can also mean unworthy
c

   this sentence comes from mwdb for consistency with the previous lines
d  presumably take the

  lead rule etc compare to  and  about being behind to be first

notes
there are two themes in

  this chapter which do not seem to fit in with typical daoist concepts  that

  of heaven conquering literally victory or beat interpreted as

  achieving its goals which sounds more like striving than nonaction and planning

  interpreted as prepares which seems contradictory to being naturally so

  although the sage also plans here and in 
a  in early societies

  whatever endeavors failed were by definition what heaven or the gods

  detested
b  this sentence only

  appears in the later sources and seems to be a parenthetical comment

  although it technically is in the majority it seems so outofplace that it

  is left out of the final translation above
c  this sentence is nearly

  impossible to translate while the first symbol in wb and hsg are the same

  making them the default majority it is different in every other source

  and none of their modern translations make sense some translators use

  a symbol slightly different than that in wb and hsg but pronounced the same

  way finally slow patient calm is only the most likely translation that

  could be found for the first symbol
d  extremely is implied

appendix 

different layers of the dao de jing
 
while translating the ddj i discovered john emersons articles

on the possibility of various layers within it based on the presence or

absence of certain symbols and themes in each chapter  while he was not

the first to suggest the presence of multiple layers of particular interest to

me was his comment  many of the objections to my method seemed to be

objections to the kinds of rough empirical nonalgorithmic methods best used

to disentangle historically confused material  having a background in

something called pattern recognition i decided to find out whether or not each

chapter could be classified as belonging to these layers based on this purely

analytical method
 
emerson tentatively identified early middle late added

very small and postguodian layers  by definition the postguodian

layer contains at least chapters  none of which appear in the guodian

source  building on emersons work extensive analysis using pattern

recognition methods based on the relative frequencies of the symbols in each

chapter indicates that the most selfconsistent results are obtained when the

ddj is separated into three layers of chapters  
early     
        
         

      
late     
         

          
 
postguodian    
     
mixed 

        

                                                           


 
excluding the chapters he identified as middle which ended

up being assigned very evenly across the other three layers none of these

completely disagree with emersons assignments except for  which is the

only entire chapter he considered to be added although he assigns some

sections of some chapters to other layers  while a significant majority

 of the chapters were strongly identified as belonging to their

layer the underlined chapters above the pattern recognition process did

indicate that a few most notably chapters     and  and to a

lesser extent      and  may have elements of more than one

layer present within them
 
note that while emersons names early late postguodian

are kept for convenience they dont necessarily have to indicate separation in

time  they could perhaps represent different oral traditions or sayings that

originally developed in different regions of china which combined to form the

dao de jing we know today  also note that the guodian document  bce

consists of chapters from both early and late in roughly equal numbers so this

layering actually happened very early
 
although chapter  was identified as being strongly

postguodian it is present in the guodian manuscript but that is not

considered a major problem for example if perhaps the postguodian style

was already being developed at the time the guodian document was created then

the presence of chapter  in the document could mean that it had already been

written in this style perhaps shortly before the guodian document was created

whereas chapters  had yet to be written or the guodian compiler was not

aware of their existence  there are probably many other scenarios that

could explain such a result
 
chapter  was variously classified as belonging to all three

layers but the symbol distributions below simultaneously indicated that it

cannot belong to any of them  if any chapter is truly a mixture of

layers it is this one which emerson agrees with so it is not assigned to

any
 
with the chapters separated as given above it is possible

to identify which symbols are used more often in one layer than another as

shown in the table below  each line represents one symbol and shows its

various english meanings as used in this translation  weak symbols

show up three to six times more often in the indicated layer than the other

two while strong symbols show up more than six times more often 

within these sections symbols are ordered from the least unbalanced to most

unbalanced distributions between the layers  unique symbols show up only

in that layer and not even once in the others  in these sections words

are listed from fewest appearances to most appearances  weak and strong

symbols must show up in at least five chapters to be included while unique

symbols must be in at least three chapters  phrases two or more symbols

are shown in italics  some punctuation symbols are included as they tend

to show differences in grammatical conventions between the layers  where

two symbols are consistently translated into the same punctuation  and

 are used to distinguish between them

the symbol for die death that is strongly postguodian is

in only one nonpostguodian chapter  where the spirit of the valley does

not die  all of the other  times  it is used is in postguodian

chapters so if it wasnt for the one use in chapter  this symbol would be

strongly unique to the postguodian chapters
 
symbols that show up much more often in two layers but

rarely in the other one are presented in the table on the following page in the

same format as the previous one  symbols in the never sections appear

about equally often in the other two layers but not once in the indicated

layer
 
dao is almost three times more likely to appear in

early and late than postguodian and there almost always as dao of but not

quite enough to make it into the following table under rarely in

postguodian

besides the symbol distributions it is interesting to note

that of the six chapters in which the majority of the sources are

anticonfucian all but chapter  are late and it is postguodian  thus

none of the early chapters are anticonfucian   also the

antimilitary chapters   are early while the chapters offering military

advice   are postguodian   finally living for the

substance is a good thing in chapter  late but a bad thing in chapters 

and  both postguodian
 
early chapters are more concerned with heaven and earth

images of the feminine and the child the concepts of withoutname and no

danger and are the only chapters that try to describe dao     

   while they have little to do with the sage only twice using thus

the sage in  chapters governing the nation easy vs difficult and never

mention the concept of not striving
 
late chapters have more confucian terms advice on how to

rule and talk about noninterference but at the same time are the only ones

that talk about possessing or taking hold of the world or the nation  
 
postguodian chapters also offer some advice on how to rule

tend to deal with hardsoftweakstrong are the only chapters that offer

military advice and talk a lot about death but rarely mention dao or de and

never mention the feminine the child emptiness or the uncarved block
 
the rest of the appendix collects all the chapters of each layer

together so the reader can see their common themes  the final section is

called what would the sage do and collects every reference to the sage from

the entire document

early
 
one
the dao that can be spoken of

is not the everconstant 
     

dao
the name that can be named is

not the everconstant 
     

name
that which is withoutname is

the beginning of heaven 
     

and earth
that which possesses a name

is the mother of the ten 
     

thousand creatures
 
therefore  always

withoutdesire thus you observe its 
     

subtle mystery
always possessing desires

thus you observe its external 
     

appearances 
these two they arise from

the same source but have 
     

different names
this sameness is called their

deep mystery
 
deep mysteries and again

deep mysteries 
the gateway of many subtle

mysteries
 
 
four
dao is like a cup or bowl

yet use it and there exists no 
     

need to fill it
profound and deep it

appears to be the ancestor of the 
     

ten thousand creatures
 
it blunts their sharpness
loosens their tangles
softens their brightness
makes them the same as the

dust of the world
 
deep and profound it seems

to barely exist
i do not know whose child it

is 
its image came before that of

god
 
 
five
heaven and earth are not kind


thus the ten thousand

creatures become as straw dogs to 
     

them
the sage is not kind 
thus the  families become

as straw dogs to him
 
the space between heaven and

earth 
how is it just like a bellows

or flute
it is empty yet does not run

out
the more it moves and the

more it produces
 
too much talking is

exceptionally exhausting
which is not as good as

maintaining what is within
 
 
six
the spirit of the valley does

not die 
it is called the deep and mysterious

feminine
 
the gateway of this deep and

mysterious feminine   
it is called the source of

heaven and earth
 
unbroken it seems to exist
using it takes no effort
 
 
seven
heaven is eternal earth is

enduring                           


the reason that heaven and

earth can be eternal and 
     

enduring
is because they do not live

for themselves
therefore they can live

forever          
 
thus the sage 
puts his self behind others

yet finds his self before them
considers his self extraneous

yet his self survives
 
is this not because he has no

selfinterests
therefore he can achieve his

selfinterests
 
 
nine
holding and filling it
are not as good as your

stopping short
 
hammering and sharpening it
can not be forever maintained
 
when gold and jade fill a

room
there is no one who can

protect it
 
to have wealth and high rank

but with arrogance 
then naturally their loss is

your own fault
 
when the task is successful

the self should let go of

it          
this is the way of heaven
 
 
ten
carrying and managing a body

while embracing the one
are you able to not separate

them
concentrating your qi to

become soft            
are you able to be like a

newborn infant
cleansing and clearing your

deep and mysterious 
     

perception
are you able to be without

blemish
loving the citizens and

governing the nation
are you able to use

nonaction
opening and closing the

gateway of heaven
are you able to serve as the

feminine
attaining clear insight in

all directions                                   


are you able to not use your

knowledge
 
creating them and raising

them
creating but not possessing
acting but not concerned with

the results
leading yet not governing 
this is called deep and

mysterious de
 
 
thirteen
favor and disgrace seem

alarming
high rank brings great

suffering if you have a self
 
what is meant by favor and

disgrace seem alarming
favor makes you the inferior

so gaining it seems 
     

alarming
losing it also seems alarming
this is what is meant by

favor and disgrace seem 
     

alarming 
 
what is meant by high rank

brings great suffering if 
     

you have a self
i am the reason that i have

great suffering i who act like 
     

i have a self
when i am without a self how

could i have suffering
 
therefore  he who is high

ranking and uses his self to 
     

serve the world 
it seems he can thus be

entrusted with the world
he who is loving and uses his

self to serve the world 
it seems he can thus be

entrusted with the world
 
 
fourteen
look it is not seen its

name is called elusive
listen it is not heard its

name is called tenuous
grasp it is not gotten its

name is called subtle and 
     

obscure
these three things can not be

investigated any further 
therefore they blend and

become one
 
this one thing 
its highest point is not

bright
its lowest point is not dark
continuous and unending it

can not be named
it returns to nonexistence
it is called the form of that

which is withoutform
the image of nonexistence
it is called confusing and

indistinct
meet it and you do not see

its beginning
follow it and you do not see

its end
 
hold fast to the way of the

ancients 
in order to master the

present moment
the ability to know the

ancient beginning 
this is called the main

principle of dao
 
 
fifteen
the virtue of the ancients

made they who were scholars 
     

subtle mysterious obscure deep and penetrating
their mysterious depths can

not be understood
 
now  only because they can

not be understood
therefore we try to emulate

their appearance 
hesitant as if crossing a

winter stream
wary as if afraid of their

neighbors all around         
respectful they are like a

visiting guest
yielding like ice that is

about to to break off
honest and genuine they are

like the uncarved block
wide and open they are like

a valley
unclear they are like muddy

water
 
who can take muddy water and

use stillness to slowly and 
     

gently make it pure and clear
who can take what is tranquil

and use continual movement 
     

to slowly and gently bring it to life
 
he who maintains this way

does not desire to be full
now  only because he is not

full
thus he can be hidden and

unfinished
 
 
sixteen
attain the utmost emptiness
maintain a profound

stillness
 
the ten thousand creatures

arise in unison
and thus i observe their

return
now  all the myriad

creatures return to their source
returning to the source

speaks of stillness
stillness is called returning

to the natural order
returning to the natural

order speaks of the 
     

everconstant
 
knowing the everconstant

speaks of insight
not knowing the everconstant

is foolish and creates 
     

misfortune
 
knowing the everconstant

leads to tolerance
being tolerant leads to being

just and unbiased
being just and unbiased leads

to being kingly 
being kingly leads to heaven
heaven leads to dao
dao leads to what endures
 
when the self disappears

there can be no danger
 
 
twenty
renounce learning and be

without worry
 
yes together with yeah  
what is their mutual distance

or nearness
beautiful together with

ugliness 
what is their mutual distance

or similarity
 
that which people fear they

are not able to not fear
how ridiculous they are not

yet centered
 
everyone is very festive
as if enjoying the tai lao

sacrifice
as if climbing terraces in

the spring
i alone am unmoved 
like one who has not yet

given any sign
like a newborn infant who

does not yet act like a baby
very tired and worn out as

if without a place to return 
     

to
 
everyone all has more than

they need
i alone seem to have lost

everything
i have the heartmind of a

foolish person indeed
i am very mixed up and

confused
 
common people are very clear

and bright
i alone seem confused
common people are very

observant and alert
i alone am very gloomy and

depressed
tranquil they are like the

ocean
i drift on the wind as if

without a place to rest
everyone all has a purpose

i alone am stupid and stubborn and appear mean and 
     

shallow
i alone am different compared

to other people 
and value the food of the

mother
 
 
twenty one
the greatest de is possible

only when dao is followed
 
the action of dao on

creatures is just indistinct just 
     

confusing
confusing and indistinct

within it exists image
indistinct and confusing

within it exists things
obscure and dark within it

exists essence
its essence is extremely real

and true
within it exists truth
 
from the present reaching to

antiquity
its name has not departed  
thus i observe the father of

the multitudes
how do i thus know the father

of the multitudes is like 
     

this 
by means of this
 
 
twenty three
minimal words are naturally

so
therefore  strong winds do

not last the entire

morning          
sudden rains do not last the

entire day
 
who makes these things 

heaven and earth
even heaven and earth can not

maintain them forever
and so how much less can people
 
therefore  of those who

engage in dao 
he who daos is one with dao
he who des is one with

de    
he who loses is one with the

loss
 
for he who is one with

dao       
dao is also pleased to have

him          
for he who is one with de

     
de is also pleased to have

him            
for he who is one with loss

   
loss is also pleased to have

him
 
if you do not trust enough

then you will not have 
     

anyones trust
 
 
twenty four
he who stands on tiptoe does

not really stand
he who stands astride can not

travel
he who displays himself does

not have insight
he who considers himself

correct does not distinguish 
     

himself     
he who boasts about himself

is without merit 
he who brags about himself

does not endure
 
he who lives in dao 

calls these leftover food and unnecessary behavior 

creatures detest them no matter what

therefore  he who possesses dao does not live by them
 
 
twenty five
something existed unformed

yet complete

before heaven and earth were created

silent  empty 
standing alone not changing

it circulates everywhere and causes no danger
it can be considered the

mother of the world
 
i do not know its name
its symbol is called dao

if i tried to make its name i would call it great

being great speaks of departing

departing speaks of being remote
being remote speaks of

returning
 
dao is great
heaven is great

earth is great

the king is also great

within the realm exist four that are great

and the king resides as one of them
 
people follow the earth

the earth follows heaven

heaven follows dao

dao follows what is naturally so
 
 
twenty eight
know your maleness but

maintain your femaleness
serve as a stream to the

world    
serving as a stream to the

world
the everconstant de will not

depart
returning you to the state of

the newborn infant
 
know your brightness but

maintain your darkness
serve as an example to the

world
serving as an example to the

world
the everconstant de will not

falter
returning you to the state of

the limitless
 
know your honor but maintain

your disgrace
serve as a valley to the

world
serving as a valley to the

world
the everconstant de will

then be sufficient
returning you to the state of

the uncarved block
 
when the uncarved block is

broken up then it becomes 
     

tools
when the sage uses it then

he becomes the senior 
     

government official
therefore  the greatest

cutting does not divide
 
 
thirty
he who uses dao to assist the

master of the people
does not use weapons or

strength on the world
for his troubles would likely

return 
in the dwelling places of

armies thorns and brambles are 
     

produced
and so what is left behind a

great army must have a bad 
     

year
 
he who has virtue gets

results and stops
he does not dare to take by

using strength
he gets results but never

brags           
gets results but never

boasts
gets results but is not

arrogant
gets results but only when

he has no choice
gets results but never uses

strength
 
when creatures are robust but

old
this is called not dao
that which is not dao has

an early finish
 
 
thirty one
now  fine weapons they are

not tools of good fortune
creatures detest them no

matter what
therefore  he who possesses

dao does not live by them
when a noble man is in his

dwelling then he honors the 
     

left
when he commands troops then

he honors the right
 
weapons they are not tools

of good fortune
they are not the tools of a noble

man
when he has no choice but to

use them
to be calm and indifferent is

superior 
never pleased indeed
and he who is pleased enjoys

killing people
 
now  he who enjoys killing

people
can not get what he desires

from the world
 
therefore  in fortunate

affairs honor the left
in unfortunate affairs honor

the right
thus the assistant general of

the army resides on the left
the supreme general of the

army resides on the right
 
thus we say they are dwelling

at a funeral 
when many people are killed
then mourn and weep with

grief for them
victory in war thus means

they will dwell at a funeral
 
 
thirty two
dao is everconstantly

withoutname
 
even though the concept of

the uncarved block seems 
     

insignificant 
no one in the world can

conquer it
if nobles and kings could

maintain it
the ten thousand creatures

would naturally obey
heaven and earth would join

with each other 
thus dropping a sweet dew
there are no citizens who

would make this happen
yet it would be naturally

fair and impartial
 
and so begin to divide and

you have names
once names exist
men should also be ready to

know when to stop
knowing when to stop is the

reason that there is no 
     

danger
 
an analogy for the action of dao

in the world 
it is similar to a stream in

a valley that becomes part of a 
     

large river or ocean
 
 
thirty four
great dao is like a vast

flood
it is able to flow left and

right
 
the ten thousand creatures

depend on it in order for life 
and are not rejected
it accomplishes its tasks

successfully 
yet does not possess a name
it clothes and supports the

ten thousand creatures 
but does not act as their

master
 
therefore  since it is

everconstantly withoutdesire
it can then be named

insignificant
 
since the ten thousand

creatures return to it 
but it does not act as their

master
it can then be named great
 
thus the sage can achieve

greatness    
because he does not act

great
therefore he can achieve

greatness
 
 
thirty five
holding fast to the great

image
the entire world comes

towards you
comes towards you and

meeting with no harm
there is the greatest peace

and calm
 
music together with good food

make passing guests stay
but daos words are bland
they are without flavor
 
look for it there is not

enough to see
listen for it there is not

enough to hear
use it there is not enough

to exhaust
 
 
thirty seven
dao everconstantly resides

in nonaction
yet nothing is left undone
 
if nobles and kings could

maintain it 
the ten thousand creatures

would naturally transform
transform and if desire

arises
i would restrain it by means

of the nameless uncarved 
     

block            
 
in the state of the nameless

uncarved block
men also would be

withoutdesire
not desiring thus they would

be still 
and the world would naturally

settle
 
 
thirty nine
of those who in ancient times

attained oneness 
heaven attained oneness thus

becoming pure and clear
earth attained oneness thus

becoming stable
spirit attained oneness thus

becoming potent
the valley attained oneness

thus becoming full
the ten thousand creatures

attained oneness thus 
     

becoming alive
nobles and kings attained

oneness thus serving the 
     

world faithfully
they attained it
 
if heaven could not use its

purity and clarity 
i fear it would split apart
if earth could not use its

stability
i fear it would erupt
if spirit could not use its

potency 
i fear it would cease to be
if the valley could not use

its fullness 
i fear it would be used up
if the ten thousand creatures

could not use their life 
i fear they would be

destroyed
if nobles and kings could not

use their high rank and 
 

    prominence
i fear they would fall
 
therefore  humility thus

serves as the source of high 
     

rank
low thus serves as the

foundation of high
thus nobles and kings call

themselves orphaned lonely 
       

and unlucky
does this not mean that

humility thus serves as the 
     

source
does it not 
 
therefore  to attain

exceptional popularity is to be 
     

without popularity 
do not desire to be scarce

like jade
but common like rock
 
 
forty one
the superior scholar hearing

of dao works hard and 
     

practices it
the average scholar hearing

of dao seems to keep it 
     

seems to lose it
the inferior scholar hearing

of dao laughs greatly at it
if he did not laugh it would

not be qualified to be dao
 
therefore  in the

established sayings that exist it is 
     

said 
insight into dao seems like

darkness
advancing in dao seems like

retreating
smooth dao seems knotted
superior de seems like a

valley
the greatest purity seems

like disgrace
the most extensive de seems

like it is not enough
established de seems aimless
real and true character seems

inconsistent
 
the greatest region is

without borders
the greatest vessel is last

to be completed
the greatest tone is a

tenuous sound
the greatest image is

withoutform
dao is hidden and

withoutname
 
now  only dao is good at

beginning and also good at 
     

completing
 
 
forty four
fame and self  which do you

love
self and property  which is

greater
gain and loss  which is the

affliction
 
extreme desire must lead to

great expense
collecting too much must lead

to substantial loss
 
knowing when you have enough

there can be no 
     

disgrace
knowing when to stop there

can be no danger
then you can forever endure
 
 
fifty one
dao creates them
de raises them
things shape them
circumstances complete them
 
thus among the ten thousand

creatures
there are none who do not

respect dao and honor de
respect of dao 
honor of de 
now  there is no one who

commands this
yet it is always naturally

so
 
therefore  dao creates them

de raises them
leads them nourishes them
shelters them heals 

them
supports them protects them
 
creating but not possessing
acting but not concerned with

the results
leading yet not governing 
this is called deep and

mysterious de
 
 
fifty two
the world had a beginning 
which can be considered the

mother of the world
once you have realized its

mother
you thus know her children
once you know her children
return to and maintain their

mother
 
when the self disappears

there can be no danger      
 
block your senses close your

gateway 
all your life you will not

struggle
open your senses be

successful in your duties 
all your life you will not

have relief
 
seeing the insignificant

speaks of insight
maintaining softness speaks

of strength
use your brightness to return

to your insight
do not lose your self in

misfortune
this is called practicing the

everconstant
 
 
fifty five
he who embodies the substance

of de
can be compared to a newborn

child 
wasps scorpions snakes and

serpents do not sting him
fierce beasts do not seize

him
birds of prey do not claw

him                                   


his bones are weak his

muscles are soft yet his grasp is 
     

firm and strong
he has not yet known the

union of female and male yet 
     

his penis rises
he has the utmost essence

indeed
he cries the entire day yet

does not get hoarse
he has the utmost harmony

indeed
 
knowing harmony speaks of the

everconstant
knowing the everconstant

speaks of insight
benefitting life speaks of

good fortune
heartmind making qi speaks

of strength
 
when creatures are robust but

old
we call them not dao
that which is not dao has

an early finish
 
 
fifty six
he who knows does not speak
he who speaks does not know
 
block your senses close your

gateway
blunt your sharpness
loosen your tangles
soften your brightness
be the same as the dust of

the world
this is called a deep and

mysterious sameness
 
therefore  you can not gain

it and be friendly
can not gain it and be

unfriendly
can not gain it and benefit
can not gain it and cause

harm
can not gain it and have high

rank
can not gain it and be lowly
 
therefore you become valuable

to the world


late
 
three
not honoring those who are

esteemable
ensures that the citizens do

not strive
not valuing rare goods
ensures that the citizens do

not act like thieves
not showing that which can be

desired
ensures that the citizens

heartminds do not become 
     

confused
 
thus the governing of the

sage
empties their heartminds

fills their stomachs
weakens their ambitions

strengthens their bones
 
by always ensuring that the

citizens are 
     

withoutknowledge and withoutdesire
those who make men wise will

not dare to act
 
act with nonaction then all

will be governed
 
 
eight
the highest virtue is like

water 
waters virtue benefits the

ten thousand creatures yet it 
     

does not strive
it dwells in places that

everyone detests 
therefore it is almost

comparable to dao
 
in dwelling the virtue is in

the land
in your heartmind the

virtue is in being profound and 
     

deep
in relations the virtue is

in being kind
in speech the virtue is in

being truthful
in governing the virtue is

in being honest and just
in your duties the virtue is

in being competent
in action the virtue is in

the timing
 
now  only because there is

no striving
therefore there is no blame
 
 
twelve
the five colors can make

peoples eyes blind
the five tones can make

peoples ears deaf
the five flavors can make

peoples mouths dull
excessive hunting and horse

racing can make peoples 
     

heartminds become wild   
rare goods can make peoples

behavior corrupt        
 
thus the sage 
acts on what is inside he

does not act on what he sees
therefore he leaves that and

chooses this
 
 
seventeen
the existence of the best

ruler is barely known to the 
     

people
next is one who they love and

praise
next is one who they fear
next is one who they

ridicule
 
if the ruler does not trust

enough then he will not have 
     

anyones trust
 
thoughtful he values his

words
 
when tasks are accomplished

and duties are successful
the  families all say we

are naturally so
 
 
eighteen
when the great dao is

abandoned 
there exists kindness and

morality
 
when intelligence and wisdom

arise 
there exists a great deal of

deception
 
when the six relationships

are not in harmony 
there exists devoted children

and loving parents
 
when the nation and the families

are very confused 
there exists loyal officials
 
 
nineteen
renounce sacredness abandon

wisdom
and the citizens benefit

fold
renounce kindness abandon

morality
and the citizens return to

being devoted children and 
   

  loving parents
renounce cleverness abandon

profit
and thieves and bandits will

not exist
 
these three things thus make

a civilized society but are 
     

not enough
 
therefore  to ensure the

citizens have a place to belong
see the simplicity
embrace the concept of the

uncarved block
less selfishness 
fewer desires
 
 
twenty two
what is wrong then becomes

whole and perfect
what is bent then becomes

straight
what is hollow then becomes

filled
what is worn out then becomes

new
have little then gain
have too much then become

confused
 
thus the sage  
embraces the one thus

serving as an example to the 
     

world 
he does not display himself

therefore he has insight
does not consider himself

correct therefore he 
     

distinguishes himself
does not boast about himself

therefore he possesses 
     

merit
does not brag about himself

therefore he endures
 
now  only because he does

not strive 
therefore no one in the world

can strive against him
 
that which the ancients say 
he who is wrong then becomes

whole and perfect 
how can these be empty words
be truly whole and perfect

and return to it
 
 
twenty seven
a good traveler is without

wagon track or footprint
a good speaker is without

flaw or disgrace
a good accountant does not

use counting tokens
a good barrier is without bar

or lock yet can not be 
     

opened
a good binding is without

cord or restraint yet can not 
     

be loosened
 
thus the sage 
is always good at helping

people 
therefore he does not abandon

people           
is always good at helping

creatures 
therefore he does not abandon

creatures
this is called following your

insight
 
therefore  he who is a

virtuous person is the teacher of 
     

he who is not a virtuous person 
he who is not a virtuous

person is the resource of he 
     

who is a virtuous person   
if the latter does not value

his teacher
or the former does not love

his resource
even if there is wisdom

there will be great confusion
this is called the essential

subtle mystery
 
 
twenty nine
would you take hold of the

world and control it       
i see you have no choice
 
now  the world is a divine

vessel
you can not control it

indeed
he who acts ruins it
he who grasps loses it
 
therefore  creatures are 
sometimes active sometimes

passive
sometimes breathe heavy

sometimes breathe easy
sometimes strong sometimes

weak
sometimes oppressed

sometimes overthrown
 
thus the sage 
removes the extremes
removes the extravagant and

wasteful
removes the arrogance
 
 
thirty eight
a man of highest de does not

use his de thus he 
     

possesses de
a man of inferior de does not

lose his de thus he is 
     

without de
 
a man of highest de uses

nonaction and acts without 
     

motive                             

    
a man of inferior de coerces

others and has a motive to 
     

act
a man of highest kindness

coerces others and acts 
     

without motive        
a man of highest morality

coerces others and has a 
     

motive to act
a man of highest propriety

coerces others and if there 
     

is no one who responds
then he rolls up his sleeves

and keeps doing it
 
therefore  lose dao and

later comes de
lose de and later comes

kindness
lose kindness and later

comes morality
lose morality and later

comes propriety
now  propriety is that which

is merely the appearance 
     

of loyalty and honesty
and the beginning of

confusion
 
he who is ahead in knowledge

has the flower of dao
but the beginning of

stupidity and foolishness
 
thus the greatest elders 
live by daos substance and

do not dwell on daos 
     

appearance
live on daos fruit and do

not dwell on daos

flower          
therefore they leave that and

choose this
 
 
forty five
great achievement seems

incomplete 
but its usefulness is not

impaired
 
great fullness is like a cup

or bowl 
its usefulness is not

exhausted
 
great straightness seems

bent
great skillfulness seems

clumsy
great debaters seem slow of speech
 
restlessness conquers cold
stillness conquers heat
 
purity and clarity along with

stillness makes the world 
     

proper and correct
 
 
forty six
when the world possesses dao
riding horses are nonetheless

used for manure
when the world is without

dao
warhorses are bred in the

countryside                                  

           
 
there is no fault greater

than the capacity for desire
there is no misfortune

greater than not knowing when 
     

you have enough
there is no error greater

than desire for gain
 
therefore  knowing the

sufficiency of having enough 
     

there is always enough
 
 
forty seven
you do not have to go out the

door 
in order to to know the

world
you do not have to look out

the window         
in order to to know the way

of

heaven                     


 
the farther you go out
you know even less
 
thus the sage 
does not travel yet knows
does not display himself yet

has a reputation
does not act yet

accomplishes
 
 
forty eight
the actions of those who

learn daily increase
the actions of those who dao

daily decrease
decreasing and again

decreasing
in order to arrive at

nonaction
 
use nonaction and nothing

is left undone
to take hold of the world

always use noninterference
when you are compelled 

to interfere
then you are not qualified to

take hold of the world
 
 
forty nine
the sage does not have a

constant heartmind
thus the  families

heartminds become his 
     

heartmind
 
he who is virtuous i am

virtuous to him
he who is not virtuous i am

also virtuous to him
because de is virtue
 
he who is honest i am honest

with him
he who is not honest i am

also honest with him
because de is honesty
 
the sage lives in the world

gathering it all in
and so he serves the world

merging with their 
     

heartminds
 
the  families all pay

attention to their ears and eyes
and the sage treats them all

like his children
 
 
fifty three
if i correctly use the

tiniest bit of knowledge that i 
     

possess
while travelling on the great

way
it is only walking off the

path that i need to fear
the great way is extremely

even
but the citizens are fond of

side paths
 
although the royal court is

very wellkept
the fields are very overgrown

with weeds
the granaries are very empty
while at the court they wear

refined multicolored silks
carry sharp swords
stuff themselves with drink

and food
and have an excess of wealth

and goods
 
this is called robbery and

extravagance
not dao indeed
 
 
fifty four
that which is well

established is not uprooted
that which is well embraced

is not abandoned
thus children and

grandchildren offer sacrifices and so 
     

sacrifices do not stop
 
cultivate it in the self 

your de will then be true and 
     

real
cultivate it in the family 

its de will then be more than 
     

enough
cultivate it in the village 

its de will then last forever
cultivate it in the nation 

its de will then be abundant
cultivate it in the world 

its de will then be everywhere
 
therefore  use your self to

contemplate the self
use your family to

contemplate the family
use your village to

contemplate the village
use your nation to

contemplate the nation
use the world to contemplate

the world
 
how do i thus know the world

is like this
by means of this
 
 
fifty seven
use honesty and justness when

governing a nation
use strange and unusual

tactics when commanding 
     

troops
use noninterference to take

hold of the world
how do i thus know it is like

this 
by means of this  
 
the world has many

prohibitions and taboos
and the citizens become even

poorer
the citizens have many sharp

tools 
and the nation and the

families grow in confusion 
the people have too much

knowledge and cleverness
and strange things begin to

increase
matters of law are

increasingly proclaimed
and more thieves and bandits

exist
 
therefore  the sage says 
i use nonaction and the

citizens naturally transform
i cherish stillness and the

citizens naturally become 
     

honest and just
i use noninterference and

the citizens naturally become 
     

wealthy
i am withoutdesire and the

citizens naturally return to 
     

the state of the uncarved block
 
 
fifty eight
if their government is very

restrained
its citizens will be very

genuine and honest
if their government is very

observant and alert
its citizens will be very

lacking and deficient
 
misfortune is that which

good fortune leans on         
good fortune is that which

misfortune lies on
who knows their limits
they are not honest and just
honesty and justness returns

becoming strange and 
     

unusual
virtue returns becoming

weird and strange
 
the confusion of the people 
its days have indeed been

everlasting
 
thus the sage  
is honest and does not

divide
is honorable and does not

injure
is straightforward and does

not indulge in excess
is bright but does not

dazzle
 
 
fifty nine
when governing people or

doing heavens duties 
it is better to be sparing
 
now  only when you can be

sparing 
this is called early

acceptance
early acceptance is called

doubling your accumulation 
     

of de
with a double accumulation of

de 
then everything can be

overcome
when everything can be

overcome 
then no one knows your

limits
when no one knows your

limits 
you can possess the nation
possessing the mother of the

nation 
you can forever endure
 
this is called having a deep

source and a firm 
     

foundation
the way of long life and

enduring sight
 
 
sixty
governing a great nation is

like cooking a small fish
 
because dao is present in the

world 
its ghosts do not have

spirit 
 
not that its ghosts do not

have any spirit
but their spirit does not

injure people
 
not only does their spirit

not injure people
the sage also does not injure

people
 
now  since these two do not

injure each other
therefore their de merges and

returns
 
 
sixty one
a great nation is like the

lowest places water can flow  
the merging place of the

world
the female of the world
 
the female always uses

stillness to conquer the male
by using stillness she

becomes lowerthan
 
therefore  if a great nation

is lowerthan a small nation
then it takes hold of the

small nation
if a small nation is

lowerthan a great nation
then it is taken hold of by

the great nation
 
therefore  sometimes one

nation is lowerthan in order 
     

to take hold of
sometimes one nation is

lowerthan and then it is taken 
     

hold of
 
a great nation merely desires

to combine livestock and 
     

people
a small nation merely desires

to get work for its people
now  for both nations to

each get that which is their 
     

desire
it is proper for the great

nation to be lowerthan
 
 
sixty two
that which daos is the

obscure mystery of the ten 
     

thousand creatures
this is the treasure of a

virtuous person
and that which is the

protection of a person who is not 
     

virtuous 
 
beautiful speech can be used

in the market
respectful behavior can

benefit people
people who are not virtuous
why abandon them
 
therefore  when inaugurating

the son of heaven
or installing the three

nobles 
even if you possessed jade

disks drawn by a team of 
     

four

horses                                  


that is not as good as

sitting and offering this way
 
what was the ancients reason

that they valued this way
did they not say  
seek in order to obtain
have faults in order to be

forgiven
 
therefore dao becomes

valuable to the world
 
 
sixty three
act with nonaction
handle duties with

noninterference
taste that which is

withoutflavor
 
greatness is insignificant

too much is less
repay animosity with de
 
plan for the difficult while

it is easy
act on the great while it is

tiny
in the world difficult duties

certainly start while easy
in the world great duties

certainly start while tiny
 
thus the sage in the end does

not act great
therefore he can achieve his

greatness
 
men who make promises

lightly certainly few will trust
men who expect most duties to

be easy will certainly 
     

have many difficulties
 
thus the sage plans for

things to be difficult
therefore in the end he is

without difficulty
 
 
sixty four
what is peaceful is easy to

hold         
what has not yet been

revealed is easy to plan for
what is brittle is easy to

shatter           
what is minute is easy to

scatter
act on it while it does not

yet exist
govern them while they are

not yet confused
 
a tree too big to embrace is

created from the tiniest 
     

shoot
a terrace of nine stories

rises from a pile of dirt
a journey of a thousand miles

begins from under the feet
 
he who acts ruins it
he who grasps loses it
 
thus the sage  
does not act therefore he

does not ruin
does not grasp therefore he

does not lose
 
citizens are always on the

verge of achieving their 
     

undertakings yet they ruin them   
be as careful in the end as

if it was the beginning 
then you will not ruin your

affairs
 
thus the sage 
desires to not desire
does not value rare goods
learns to not learn
 
he returns to that which

everyone else has passed over
thus helping the ten thousand

creatures to be naturally 
     

so 
yet not daring to act
 
 
sixty five
the virtue of the ancients

they who acted in dao
did not use it to enlighten

the citizens
but would have used it to

keep them ignorant 
the citizens are hard to

govern
because they have too much

knowledge
 
therefore  using knowledge

to govern the nation
is the bane of the nation
not using knowledge to govern

the nation
is the good fortune of the

nation
he who has knowledge of these

two also has them as 
     

examples
 
to always understand these

examples 
this is called deep and

mysterious de
deep and mysterious de is so

profound and remote
that when creatures return

it returns with them
then they reach the greatest

harmony
 
 
sixty six
the reason that rivers and

seas can act as kings of the 
     

 valleys
is because they are good at being

lowerthan them     
therefore  they can act as

kings of the  valleys
 
thus the sage 
in desiring to be above the

citizens 
he must by means of his

speech be lowerthan them 
in desiring to be before the

citizens 
he must by means of his self

be behind them
 
thus the sage 
lives above them but the

citizens are not burdened
lives in front of them but

the citizens are not harmed
thus the world is pleased to

promote him and does not 
     

tire of him
 
because he does not strive
therefore no one in the world

can strive against him


postguodian
 
eleven
thirty spokes of a wheel

share one hub
in its emptiness exists the

usefulness of the cart
 
mix water with clay thus

making a vessel
in its emptiness exists the

usefulness of the vessel
 
cut out doors and windows

thus making a room        
in their emptiness exists the

usefulness of the room
 
therefore  what exists thus

makes a thing profitable
emptiness thus makes it

useful
 
 
twenty six
serious

serves as the source of frivolous

stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness
thus the noble man travels

the entire day 
and does not stray from his

wagon
he is serious even though

glorious sights and feasts 
     

exist 
he

lives above them like this
so how could one be the

master of ten thousand chariots 
and conduct his self

frivolously in the world     
 
be frivolous then lose the

source

be restless then lose the rulership
 
 
thirty three
he who knows people is wise
he who knows himself has

insight
 
he who is victorious over

people possesses power
he who is victorious over

himself is strong
 
he who knows he has enough is

wealthy
he who uses force possesses

ambition
 
he who does not lose his

place endures
he who dies yet does not

perish has longevity
 
 
thirty six
when you are about to gather

something
you must have originally

spread it out
when you are about to weaken

something
you must have originally

strengthened it
when you are about to abandon

something
you must have originally been

interested in it
when you are about to seize

something
you must have originally

given it
 
this is called subtle and

obscure insight
 
what is soft and weak

conquers what is hard and strong
 
fish can not escape from the

deep
the sharp tools of the nation
can not be shown to the

people
 
 
forty
the movement of dao returns

things
the function of dao is to

weaken things
 
the ten thousand creatures of

the world are created from 
     

being
being is created from

nonbeing
 
 
forty two
dao creates one
one creates two
two creates three
three creates the ten

thousand creatures
the ten thousand creatures

carry yin and embrace yang
pouring their qi together

thus becoming harmonious
 
that which people detest 
being alone orphaned

lonely and unlucky 
yet kings and nobles thus

name themselves
 
therefore  creatures 
sometimes lose yet they

gain
sometimes gain yet they

lose
 
that which people teach i

also teach 
those who are bullies and

hoodlums do not meet their 
     

natural death
i will thus become their

elder teacher
 
 
forty three
the softest things of the

world
overrun the hardest things of

the world
 
nonbeing can enter where

there is no space in between
thus i know that nonaction

has benefits
 
the teaching of notalking
the benefit of nonaction 
few in the world attain

these
 
 
fifty
between coming out into life

and entering death
followers of life are  in


followers of death are  in 
people whose lives are merely

moving them towards the 
     

place of death 
are also  in 
 
now  what is the reason
because they live life for

its substance
 
but i have heard that he who

is skilled at taking in life
can travel the mountains and

does not meet rhino or 
     

tiger
can enter a battle not

wearing armor or weapons
the rhino has no place to

thrust its horns
the tiger has no place to use

its claws
the weapon has no place to

allow its blade
 
now  what is the reason
because for him there is no

place of death
 
 
sixty seven
in the world all say i am

great
but do not seem to be like

everyone else
now  only because i am

not  like everyone else 
      

therefore i can be great
if i was like everyone else
long ago i would have become

insignificant indeed
 
now   i possess three

treasures  
hold and maintain them
the first is called

compassion
the second is called economy
the third is called not

daring to act first in the world
 
with compassion you can

therefore be brave
with economy you can

therefore expand
by not daring to act first in

the world
therefore you can achieve the

capacity for leadership
 
at present people abandon

compassion but also try to be 
     

brave
abandon economy but also try

to expand
abandon being behind but also

try to be first 
this is death
 
now  when compassion is used

in war the consequence 
     

is victory
when it is used for

protection the consequence is 
     

strength
when heaven would help you
using compassion it protects

you
 
 
sixty eight
he who is good at being a

scholar is not militant
he who is good at war does

not get angry
he who is good at conquering

the enemy does not 
     

engage them
he who is good at making use

of people acts lowerthan 
     

them
 
this is called the de of not

striving
this is called the power of

making use of people
this is called joining the

elite of heavens ancients 
     

indeed
 
 
sixty nine
those who command troops have

a saying  
i dare not act like the

master but instead act like a guest
dare not advance an inch but

instead retreat a foot
 
this is called marching

without marching
seizing without using your

arms
routing without having an

enemy
defending without using

weapons
 
there is no misfortune

greater than underestimating the 
     

enemy
by underestimating the enemy

i nearly lose my 
      

treasures
 
therefore  when armies on

opposing sides are evenly 
     

matched
then they who mourn will be

victorious
 
 
seventy
my words are very easy to

understand
very easy to practice
but there is no one in the

world who can understand 
     

them
there is no one who can

practice them
 
my words possess a lineage
my duties possess a ruler
 
now  only because i am

withoutknowledge
thus i am not understood
those who understand me are

rare
consequently i am one who is

valued
 
thus the sage wears coarse

cloth but carries jade in his 
     

heart
 
 
seventy one
knowing that you do not know

is honorable
not knowing that you know is

a sickness
 
now  only when you are sick

of sickness
thus you are not sick
 
the sage is not sick
because he is sick of

sickness
thus he is not sick
 
 
seventy two
if the citizens do not fear

your authority
then a greater authority will

arrive
 
do not disrespect their

dwellings
do not despise their

livelihood 
 
now  only because you do not

despise them
thus they will not tire of

you
 
thus the sage 
knows himself but not display

himself
loves himself but does not

exalt himself
therefore he leaves that and

chooses this
 
 
seventy three
when your courage lies in

daring
the consequence is killing
when your courage lies in not

daring
the consequence is survival
 
these two choices they

sometimes cause benefit 
     

sometimes cause harm
that which heaven detests 

who knows its reasons
 
the way of heaven 
does not strive yet

skillfully achieves its goals
does not speak yet

skillfully responds
does not summon yet everything

naturally comes to it
is certainly unhurried yet

skillfully prepares
 
heavens net is extremely

vast
it is wide meshed yet does

not fail
 
 
seventy four
if the citizens do not fear

death
how can you use death to

frighten them
assuming you could ensure

that the citizens always fear 
     

death
and i get hold of those who

act strange and unusual and 
     

kill them
then who would be daring
 
there will always exist an

executioner
now  to take the place of

the executioner to do the 
     

killing
this is called taking the

place of a great craftsman to 
     

carve wood
now  of those who take the

place of a great craftsman to 
     

carve wood
few will not injure their

hand
 
 
seventy five
the citizens are hungry
because their superiors eat

too much of their taxes
thus they are hungry
 
the citizens are hard to

govern
because their superiors are

compelled to take action
thus they are hard to govern
 
the citizens take death

lightly
because they seek the substance

of life
thus they take death lightly
 
now  only he who has no use

for being alive
is virtuous compared to he

who values living
 
 
seventy six
the people are born indeed

soft and weak
they die indeed hard and

inflexible 
the ten thousand creatures

the grass and trees are born 
     

indeed soft and fragile
they die indeed dried and

withered
 
therefore  that which is

hard and inflexible is a follower 
     

of death
that which is soft and weak

is a follower of life
 
thus if a weapon is

inflexible the consequence is defeat      
if a tree is inflexible then

it snaps
 
inflexible and great dwell

below
soft and weak dwell above
 
 
seventy seven
the way of heaven how it is

just like stretching a bow
he who is high is pressed

down by it
he who is low is lifted by

it
he who has excess is reduced

by it
he who does not have enough

is filled by it
 
the way of heaven
reduces what has excess and

fills what does not have 
     

enough
the way of people on the

other hand is not like this
and takes from those who do

not have enough in order to 
     

offer it to those who have too much
 
who can have too much and

offer it to the world
only he who possesses dao
 
thus the sage 
acts but is not concerned

with the results
accomplishes his tasks but

does not dwell on them
he does not desire to display

his virtue
 
 
seventy eight
in the world nothing is

softer and weaker than water
yet for attacking that which

is hard and strong
there is nothing that can

surpass it
this is because it endlessly

replaces itself
 
weakness conquers strength
softness conquers hardness
in the world there is no one

who does not know this
but there is no one who can

practice it
 
thus the sage says 
accepting upon oneself the

disgrace of the nation
is called being master of the

shrines
accepting upon oneself the

misfortune of the nation
is called being king of the

world
 
honest words seem contrary
 


seventy nine
harmonize a great resentment


and there must exist some

remaining resentment
how can this be considered

good
 
thus the sage  
holds the left side of an

agreement
but does not demand payment

of people
 
therefore  to have de is to

take charge of your 
     

agreements
to be without de is to take

charge of taking away from 
     

others
 
the way of heaven while

without favor
is always with virtuous

people
 
 
eighty
in a small nation with few

citizens 
ensure that it has the

weapons of ten nobles but does not 
     

use them
ensure that the citizens take

death seriously and do not 
     

migrate far
even though they have boats

and carriages there is no 
     

place to take advantage of them
even though they have armor

and weapons there is no 
     

place to display them
 
ensure that the citizens

return to knotting ropes and using 
     

them
find deliciousness in their

food
beauty in their clothes
contentment in their

dwellings
happiness in their customs
 
although neighboring nations

overlook one another
and sounds of roosters and

dogs can be heard in one 
     

another 
the citizens reach old age

and die
and do not come and go

between one another
 
 
eighty one
true words are not beautiful
beautiful words are not true
 
he who has virtue does not

argue
he who argues does not have

virtue
 
he who knows is not learned
he who is learned does not

know
 
the sage does not accumulate

things 
since through serving people

the more one has
since through giving to

people one has even more
 
the way of heaven benefits

and does not cause harm
the way of the sage acts yet

does not strive
 
 
 
as mentioned above

chapter  seems to be a truly mongrel chapter with characteristics that

indicate it belongs to all three layers and none of them  therefore it

is presented here separate from the other layers
 
two
in the world when all know

that the action of beauty is 
     

beautiful then ugliness ensues
when all know that the action

of good is goodness then 
     

notgood ensues

              

   
 
therefore  being and

nonbeing create each other
difficult and easy complete

each other
long and short contrast each

other
high and low lean on each

other
tone and voice harmonize each

other
before and after follow each

other
 
thus the sage 
lives by using nonaction in

his duties
and practicing notalking in

his teachings
 
the ten thousand creatures

arise but do not have a 
     

beginning 
creating but not possessing
acting but not concerned

with the results
accomplishing tasks but not

dwelling on them          
 
now  only because there is

no dwelling
thus the results do not

depart
 
 
what would the sage do
thus the sage 
lives by using nonaction in

his duties
and practicing notalking in

his teachings
 
thus the governing of the

sage
empties their heartminds

fills their bellies
weakens their ambitions

strengthens their bones
 
the sage is not kind
thus the  families become

as straw dogs to him
 
thus the sage 
puts his self behind others

yet finds his self before them
considers his self

extraneous yet his self survives
is this not because he has no

selfinterests
therefore he can achieve his

selfinterests
 
thus the sage 
acts on what is inside he

does not act on what he sees
therefore he leaves that and

chooses this
 
thus the sage  
embraces the one thus

serving as an example to the 
     

world 
he does not display himself

therefore he has insight
does not consider himself

correct therefore he 
     

distinguishes himself
does not boast about himself

therefore he possesses 
     

merit
does not brag about himself

therefore he endures
now  only because he does

not strive 
therefore no one in the world

can strive against him
 
thus the sage 
is always good at helping

people 
therefore he does not abandon

people           
is always good at helping

creatures 
therefore he does not abandon

creatures
this is called following your

insight
 
thus the sage 
removes the extremes
removes the extravagant and

wasteful
removes the arrogance
 
thus the sage can achieve

greatness    
because he does not act

great
therefore he can achieve

greatness
 
thus the sage 
does not travel yet knows
does not display himself yet

has a reputation
does not act yet

accomplishes
 
 
the sage does not have a

constant heartmind
thus the  families

heartminds become his 
     

heartmind
 
the sage lives in the world

taking it all in
and so he serves the world

merging with their 
     

heartminds
 
the  families all pay

attention to their ears and eyes
and the sage treats them all

like his children
 
therefore  the sage says 
i use nonaction and the

citizens naturally transform
i cherish stillness and the

citizens naturally become 
     

honest and just
i use noninterference and

the citizens naturally become 
     

wealthy
i am withoutdesire and the

citizens naturally return to 
     

the state of the uncarved block
 
thus the sage  
is honest and does not

divide
is honorable and does not

injure
is straightforward and does

not indulge in excess
is bright but does not

dazzle
 
the sage also does not injure

people
 
thus the sage in the end does

not act great
therefore he can achieve his

greatness
 
thus the sage plans for

things to be difficult
therefore in the end he is

without difficulty
 
thus the sage  
does not act therefore he

does not ruin
does not grasp therefore he

does not lose
 
thus the sage 
desires to not desire
does not value rare goods
learns to not learn
 
thus the sage 
in desiring to be above the

citizens 
he must by means of his

speech be lowerthan them 
in desiring to be before the

citizens 
he must by means of his self be

behind them
 
thus the sage 
lives above them but the

citizens are not burdened
lives in front of them but

the citizens are not harmed
thus the world is pleased to

promote him and does not 
     

tire of him
 
thus the sage wears coarse

cloth but carries jade in his 
     

heart
 
the sage is not sick
because he is sick of

sickness
thus he is not sick
 
thus the sage 
knows himself but not display

himself
loves himself but does not

exalt himself
therefore he leaves that and

chooses this
 
thus the sage 
acts but is not concerned

with the results
accomplishes his tasks but

does not dwell on them
he does not desire to display

his virtue
 
thus the sage says 
accepting upon oneself the

disgrace of the nation
is called being master of the

shrines
accepting upon oneself the

misfortune of the nation
is called being king of the

world
 
thus the sage  
holds the left side of an

agreement
but does not demand payment

of people
 
the sage does not accumulate

things 
since through serving people

the more one has
since through giving to

people one has even more
 
the way of the sage acts yet

does not strive

      ch   the tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging

      tao the name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name

    


       conceived of as having no name it is the originator of heaven and

      earth conceived of as having a name it is the mother of all things

    


      

    


   always without desire we must be found

   if its deep mystery we would sound

   but if desire always within us be

   its outer fringe is all that we shall see




       under these two aspects it is really the same but as development

      takes place it receives the different names together we call them the

      mystery where the mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is

      subtle and wonderful

    


        all in the world know the beauty of the beautiful and in doing this

      they have the idea of what ugliness is they all know the skill of the

      skilful and in doing this they have the idea of what the want of skill

      is

    


       so it is that existence and nonexistence give birth the one to the

      idea of the other that difficulty and ease produce the one the idea of

      the other that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the

      other that the ideas of height and lowness arise from the contrast of

      the one with the other that the musical notes and tones become harmonious

      through the relation of one with another and that being before and behind

      give the idea of one following another

    


       therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything and conveys

      his instructions without the use of speech

    


       all things spring up and there is not one which declines to show

      itself they grow and there is no claim made for their ownership they go

      through their processes and there is no expectation of a reward for the

      results the work is accomplished and there is no resting in it as an

      achievement

    


   the work is done but how no one can see

  tis this that makes the power not cease to be




        not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep

      the people from rivalry among themselves not to prize articles which are

      difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves not to

      show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their

      minds from disorder

    


       therefore the sage in the exercise of his government empties their

      minds fills their bellies weakens their wills and strengthens their

      bones

    


       he constantly tries to keep them without knowledge and without

      desire and where there are those who have knowledge to keep them from

      presuming to act on it when there is this abstinence from action good

      order is universal

    


        the tao is like the emptiness of a vessel and in our employment

      of it we must be on our guard against all fulness how deep and

      unfathomable it is as if it were the honoured ancestor of all things

    


       we should blunt our sharp points and unravel the complications of

      things we should attemper our brightness and bring ourselves into

      agreement with the obscurity of others how pure and still the tao is as

      if it would ever so continue

    


       i do not know whose son it is it might appear to have been before god

    


        heaven and earth do not act from the impulse of any wish to be

      benevolent they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with

      the sages do not act from any wish to be benevolent they deal with the

      people as the dogs of grass are dealt with

    


       may not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows

    


  tis emptied yet it loses not its power

  tis moved again and sends forth air the more

   much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see

   your inner being guard and keep it free




      

    


   the valley spirit dies not aye the same

   the female mystery thus do we name

   its gate from which at first they issued forth

   is called the root from which grew heaven and earth

   long and unbroken does its power remain

   used gently and without the touch of pain




        heaven is longenduring and earth continues long the reason why

      heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they

      do not live of or for themselves this is how they are able to continue

      and endure

    


       therefore the sage puts his own person last and yet it is found in the

      foremost place he treats his person as if it were foreign to him and yet

      that person is preserved is it not because he has no personal and private

      ends that therefore such ends are realised

    


        the highest excellence is like that of water the excellence of

      water appears in its benefiting all things and in its occupying without

      striving to the contrary the low place which all men dislike hence

      its way is near to that of the tao

    


       the excellence of a residence is in the suitability of the place

      that of the mind is in abysmal stillness that of associations is in their

      being with the virtuous that of government is in its securing good order

      that of the conduct of affairs is in its ability and that of the

      initiation of any movement is in its timeliness

    


       and when one with the highest excellence does not wrangle about his

      low position no one finds fault with him

    


        it is better to leave a vessel unfilled than to attempt to carry it

      when it is full if you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened the

      point cannot long preserve its sharpness

    


       when gold and jade fill the hall their possessor cannot keep them

      safe when wealth and honours lead to arrogancy this brings its evil on

      itself when the work is done and ones name is becoming distinguished

      to withdraw into obscurity is the way of heaven

    


        when the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one

      embrace they can be kept from separating when one gives undivided

      attention to the vital breath and brings it to the utmost degree of

      pliancy he can become as a tender babe when he has cleansed away the

      most mysterious sights of his imagination he can become without a flaw

    


       in loving the people and ruling the state cannot he proceed without

      any purpose of action in the opening and shutting of his gates of

      heaven cannot he do so as a female bird while his intelligence reaches

      in every direction cannot he appear to be without knowledge

    


       the tao produces all things and nourishes them it produces them

      and does not claim them as its own it does all and yet does not boast of

      it it presides over all and yet does not control them this is what is

      called the mysterious quality of the tao

    


       the thirty spokes unite in the one nave but it is on the empty space

      for the axle that the use of the wheel depends clay is fashioned into

      vessels but it is on their empty hollowness that their use depends the

      door and windows are cut out from the walls to form an apartment but it

      is on the empty space within that its use depends therefore what has

      a positive existence serves for profitable adaptation and what has not

      that for actual usefulness

    


      

    


      

    


   colours five hues from th eyes their sight will take

   musics five notes the ears as deaf can make

   the flavours five deprive the mouth of taste

   the chariot course and the wild hunting waste

   make mad the mind and objects rare and strange

   sought for mens conduct will to evil change




       therefore the sage seeks to satisfy the craving of the belly and not

      the insatiable longing of the eyes he puts from him the latter and

      prefers to seek the former

    


        favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared honour and

      great calamity to be regarded as personal conditions of the same kind

    


       what is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace disgrace is

      being in a low position after the enjoyment of favour the getting that

      favour leads to the apprehension of losing it and the losing it leads

      to the fear of still greater calamitythis is what is meant by

      saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared

    


      and what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be

      similarly regarded as personal conditions what makes me liable to great

      calamity is my having the body which i call myself if i had not the

      body what great calamity could come to me

    


       therefore he who would administer the kingdom honouring it as he

      honours his own person may be employed to govern it and he who would

      administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be

      entrusted with it

    


        we look at it and we do not see it and we name it the equable

      we listen to it and we do not hear it and we name it the inaudible we

      try to grasp it and do not get hold of it and we name it the subtle

      with these three qualities it cannot be made the subject of description

      and hence we blend them together and obtain the one

    


       its upper part is not bright and its lower part is not obscure

      ceaseless in its action it yet cannot be named and then it again returns

      and becomes nothing this is called the form of the formless and the

      semblance of the invisible this is called the fleeting and

      indeterminable

    


       we meet it and do not see its front we follow it and do not see its

      back when we can lay hold of the tao of old to direct the things of the

      present day and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning

      this is called unwinding the clue of tao

    


        the skilful masters of the tao in old times with a subtle and

      exquisite penetration comprehended its mysteries and were deep also so

      as to elude mens knowledge as they were thus beyond mens knowledge i

      will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be

    


       shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter

      irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them grave like a

      guest in awe of his host evanescent like ice that is melting away

      unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything vacant

      like a valley and dull like muddy water

    


       who can make the muddy water clear let it be still and it will

      gradually become clear who can secure the condition of rest let movement

      go on and the condition of rest will gradually arise

    


       they who preserve this method of the tao do not wish to be full of

      themselves it is through their not being full of themselves that they

      can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete

    


        the state of vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree and

      that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour all things alike go

      through their processes of activity and then we see them return to

      their original state when things in the vegetable world have displayed

      their luxuriant growth we see each of them return to its root this

      returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness and that

      stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their

      appointed end

    


       the report of that fulfilment is the regular unchanging rule to know

      that unchanging rule is to be intelligent not to know it leads to wild

      movements and evil issues the knowledge of that unchanging rule produces

      a grand capacity and forbearance and that capacity and forbearance lead

      to a community of feeling with all things from this community of

      feeling comes a kingliness of character and he who is kinglike goes on

      to be heavenlike in that likeness to heaven he possesses the tao

      possessed of the tao he endures long and to the end of his bodily life

      is exempt from all danger of decay

    


        in the highest antiquity the people did not know that there were

      their rulers in the next age they loved them and praised them in the

      next they feared them in the next they despised them thus it was that

      when faith in the tao was deficient in the rulers a want of faith in

      them ensued in the people

    


       how irresolute did those earliest rulers appear showing by their

      reticence the importance which they set upon their words their work was

      done and their undertakings were successful while the people all said

      we are as we are of ourselves

    


        when the great tao way or method ceased to be observed

      benevolence and righteousness came into vogue then appeared wisdom and

      shrewdness and there ensued great hypocrisy

    


       when harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships filial

      sons found their manifestation when the states and clans fell into

      disorder loyal ministers appeared

    


        if we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom it would

      be better for the people a hundredfold if we could renounce our

      benevolence and discard our righteousness the people would again become

      filial and kindly if we could renounce our artful contrivances and

      discard our scheming for gain there would be no thieves nor robbers

    


      

    


   those three methods of government

   thought olden ways in elegance did fail

   and made these names their want of worth to veil

   but simple views and courses plain and true

   would selfish ends and many lusts eschew




      

    


      

    


   when we renounce learning we have no troubles

   the ready yes and flattering yea

   small is the difference they display

   but mark their issues good and ill

   what space the gulf between shall fill




      what all men fear is indeed to be feared but how wide and without end is

      the range of questions asking to be discussed

    


       the multitude of men look satisfied and pleased as if enjoying a full

      banquet as if mounted on a tower in spring i alone seem listless and

      still my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence i

      am like an infant which has not yet smiled i look dejected and forlorn

      as if i had no home to go to the multitude of men all have enough and to

      spare i alone seem to have lost everything my mind is that of a stupid

      man i am in a state of chaos

    


      ordinary men look bright and intelligent while i alone seem to be

      benighted they look full of discrimination while i alone am dull and

      confused i seem to be carried about as on the sea drifting as if i had

      nowhere to rest all men have their spheres of action while i alone seem

      dull and incapable like a rude borderer thus i alone am different from

      other men but i value the nursingmother the tao

    


      

    


    the grandest forms of active force

    from tao come their only source

    who can of tao the nature tell

    our sight it flies our touch as well

    eluding sight eluding touch

    the forms of things all in it crouch

    eluding touch eluding sight

    there are their semblances all right

    profound it is dark and obscure

    things essences all there endure

    those essences the truth enfold

    of what when seen shall then be told

    now it is so twas so of old

    its namewhat passes not away

    so in their beautiful array

    things form and never know decay




      how know i that it is so with all the beauties of existing things by this

      nature of the tao

    


        the partial becomes complete the crooked straight the empty

      full the worn out new he whose desires are few gets them he whose

      desires are many goes astray

    


       therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing of humility

      and manifests it to all the world he is free from selfdisplay and

      therefore he shines from selfassertion and therefore he is

      distinguished from selfboasting and therefore his merit is

      acknowledged from selfcomplacency and therefore he acquires

      superiority it is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no

      one in the world is able to strive with him

    


       that saying of the ancients that the partial becomes complete was not

      vainly spokenall real completion is comprehended under it

    


        abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of

      his nature a violent wind does not last for a whole morning a sudden

      rain does not last for the whole day to whom is it that these two

      things are owing to heaven and earth if heaven and earth cannot make

      such spasmodic actings last long how much less can man

    


       therefore when one is making the tao his business those who are also

      pursuing it agree with him in it and those who are making the

      manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that while

      even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they

      fail

    


       hence those with whom he agrees as to the tao have the happiness of

      attaining to it those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have

      the happiness of attaining to it and those with whom he agrees in their

      failure have also the happiness of attaining to the tao but when

      there is not faith sufficient on his part a want of faith in him

      ensues on the part of the others

    


       he who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm he who stretches his

      legs does not walk easily so he who displays himself does not shine

      he who asserts his own views is not distinguished he who vaunts himself

      does not find his merit acknowledged he who is selfconceited has no

      superiority allowed to him such conditions viewed from the standpoint of

      the tao are like remnants of food or a tumour on the body which all

      dislike hence those who pursue the course of the tao do not adopt and

      allow them

    


        there was something undefined and complete coming into existence

      before heaven and earth how still it was and formless standing alone

      and undergoing no change reaching everywhere and in no danger of being

      exhausted it may be regarded as the mother of all things

    


       i do not know its name and i give it the designation of the tao the

      way or course making an effort further to give it a name i call it the

      great

    


       great it passes on in constant flow passing on it becomes remote

      having become remote it returns therefore the tao is great heaven is

      great earth is great and the sage king is also great in the universe

      there are four that are great and the sage king is one of them

    


       man takes his law from the earth the earth takes its law from heaven

      heaven takes its law from the tao the law of the tao is its being what it

      is

    


        gravity is the root of lightness stillness the ruler of movement

    


       therefore a wise prince marching the whole day does not go far from

      his baggage waggons although he may have brilliant prospects to look at

      he quietly remains in his proper place indifferent to them how should

      the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom if

      he do act lightly he has lost his root of gravity if he proceed to

      active movement he will lose his throne

    


        the skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps

      the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed

      the skilful reckoner uses no tallies the skilful closer needs no bolts or

      bars while to open what he has shut will be impossible the skilful

      binder uses no strings or knots while to unloose what he has bound will

      be impossible in the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men

      and so he does not cast away any man he is always skilful at saving

      things and so he does not cast away anything this is called hiding the

      light of his procedure

    


       therefore the man of skill is a master to be looked up to by him who

      has not the skill and he who has not the skill is the helper of the

      reputation of him who has the skill if the one did not honour his

      master and the other did not rejoice in his helper an observer though

      intelligent might greatly err about them this is called the utmost

      degree of mystery

    


      

    


      

    


   who knows his manhoods strength

   yet still his female feebleness maintains

   as to one channel flow the many drains

   all come to him yea all beneath the sky

   thus he the constant excellence retains

   the simple child again free from all stains



   who knows how white attracts

   yet always keeps himself within blacks shade

   the pattern of humility displayed

   displayed in view of all beneath the sky

   he in the unchanging excellence arrayed

   endless return to mans first state has made



   who knows how glory shines

   yet loves disgrace nor eer for it is pale

   behold his presence in a spacious vale

   to which men come from all beneath the sky

   the unchanging excellence completes its tale

   the simple infant man in him we hail




       the unwrought material when divided and distributed forms vessels

      the sage when employed becomes the head of all the officers of

      government and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent

      measures

    


        if any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself and to

      effect this by what he does i see that he will not succeed the kingdom

      is a spiritlike thing and cannot be got by active doing he who would so

      win it destroys it he who would hold it in his grasp loses it

    


      

    


   the course and nature of things is such that

   what was in front is now behind

   what warmed anon we freezing find

   strength is of weakness oft the spoil

   the store in ruins mocks our toil




      hence the sage puts away excessive effort extravagance and easy

      indulgence

    


        he who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the tao will not

      assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms such a course is sure

      to meet with its proper return

    


       wherever a host is stationed briars and thorns spring up in the

      sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years

    


       a skilful commander strikes a decisive blow and stops he does not

      dare by continuing his operations to assert and complete his mastery he

      will strike the blow but will be on his guard against being vain or

      boastful or arrogant in consequence of it he strikes it as a matter of

      necessity he strikes it but not from a wish for mastery

    


       when things have attained their strong maturity they become old this

      may be said to be not in accordance with the tao and what is not in

      accordance with it soon comes to an end

    


        now arms however beautiful are instruments of evil omen hateful

      it may be said to all creatures therefore they who have the tao do not

      like to employ them

    


       the superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable

      place but in time of war the right hand those sharp weapons are

      instruments of evil omen and not the instruments of the superior manhe

      uses them only on the compulsion of necessity calm and repose are what he

      prizes victory by force of arms is to him undesirable to consider this

      desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men and he who delights

      in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom

    


       on occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized

      position on occasions of mourning the right hand the second in command

      of the army has his place on the left the general commanding in chief has

      his on the righthis place that is is assigned to him as in the

      rites of mourning he who has killed multitudes of men should weep for

      them with the bitterest grief and the victor in battle has his place

      rightly according to those rites

    


        the tao considered as unchanging has no name

    


       though in its primordial simplicity it may be small the whole world

      dares not deal with one embodying it as a minister if a feudal prince

      or the king could guard and hold it all would spontaneously submit

      themselves to him

    


       heaven and earth under its guidance unite together and send down the

      sweet dew which without the directions of men reaches equally

      everywhere as of its own accord

    


       as soon as it proceeds to action it has a name when it once has that

      name men can know to rest in it when they know to rest in it they can

      be free from all risk of failure and error

    


       the relation of the tao to all the world is like that of the great

      rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys

    


        he who knows other men is discerning he who knows himself is

      intelligent he who overcomes others is strong he who overcomes himself

      is mighty he who is satisfied with his lot is rich he who goes on acting

      with energy has a firm will

    


       he who does not fail in the requirements of his position continues

      long he who dies and yet does not perish has longevity

    


        allpervading is the great tao it may be found on the left hand

      and on the right

    


       all things depend on it for their production which it gives to them

      not one refusing obedience to it when its work is accomplished it does

      not claim the name of having done it it clothes all things as with a

      garment and makes no assumption of being their lordit may be

      named in the smallest things all things return to their root and

      disappear and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing

      soit may be named in the greatest things

    


       hence the sage is able in the same way to accomplish his great

      achievements it is through his not making himself great that he can

      accomplish them

    


        to him who holds in his hands the great image of the invisible

      tao the whole world repairs men resort to him and receive no hurt but

      find rest peace and the feeling of ease

    


       music and dainties will make the passing guest stop for a time but

      though the tao as it comes from the mouth seems insipid and has no

      flavour though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to the use

      of it is inexhaustible

    


        when one is about to take an inspiration he is sure to make a

      previous expiration when he is going to weaken another he will first

      strengthen him when he is going to overthrow another he will first have

      raised him up when he is going to despoil another he will first have

      made gifts to himthis is called hiding the light of his

      procedure

    


       the soft overcomes the hard and the weak the strong

    


       fishes should not be taken from the deep instruments for the profit of

      a state should not be shown to the people

    


        the tao in its regular course does nothing for the sake of doing

      it and so there is nothing which it does not do

    


       if princes and kings were able to maintain it all things would of

      themselves be transformed by them

    


       if this transformation became to me an object of desire i would

      express the desire by the nameless simplicity

    


   simplicity without a name

   is free from all external aim

   with no desire at rest and still

   all things go right as of their will




 






      part ii

    


        those who possessed in highest degree the attributes of the tao

      did not seek to show them and therefore they possessed them in fullest

      measure those who possessed in a lower degree those attributes sought

      how not to lose them and therefore they did not possess them in fullest

      measure

    


       those who possessed in the highest degree those attributes did

      nothing with a purpose and had no need to do anything those who

      possessed them in a lower degree were always doing and had need to be

      so doing

    


       those who possessed the highest benevolence were always seeking to

      carry it out and had no need to be doing so those who possessed the

      highest righteousness were always seeking to carry it out and had need

      to be so doing

    


       those who possessed the highest sense of propriety were always

      seeking to show it and when men did not respond to it they bared the

      arm and marched up to them

    


       thus it was that when the tao was lost its attributes appeared when

      its attributes were lost benevolence appeared when benevolence was lost

      righteousness appeared and when righteousness was lost the proprieties

      appeared

    


       now propriety is the attenuated form of lealheartedness and good

      faith and is also the commencement of disorder swift apprehension is

      only a flower of the tao and is the beginning of stupidity

    


       thus it is that the great man abides by what is solid and eschews what

      is flimsy dwells with the fruit and not with the flower it is thus that

      he puts away the one and makes choice of the other

    


        the things which from of old have got the one the tao are

    


   heaven which by it is bright and pure

   earth rendered thereby firm and sure

   spirits with powers by it supplied

   valleys kept full throughout their void

   all creatures which through it do live

   princes and kings who from it get

   the model which to all they give




      all these are the results of the one tao

    


      

    


   if heaven were not thus pure it soon would rend

   if earth were not thus sure twould break and bend

   without these powers the spirits soon would fail

   if not so filled the drought would parch each vale

   without that life creatures would pass away

   princes and kings without that moral sway

   however grand and high would all decay




       thus it is that dignity finds its firm root in its previous

      meanness and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness from which

      it rises hence princes and kings call themselves orphans men of

      small virtue and as carriages without a nave is not this an

      acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the

      foundation of their dignity so it is that in the enumeration of the

      different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the

      ends of a carriage they do not wish to show themselves elegantlooking as

      jade but prefer to be coarselooking as an ordinary stone

    


      

    


      

    


   the movement of the tao

     by contraries proceeds

   and weakness marks the course

     of taos mighty deeds




       all things under heaven sprang from it as existing and named that

      existence sprang from it as nonexistent and not named

    


        scholars of the highest class when they hear about the tao

      earnestly carry it into practice scholars of the middle class when they

      have heard about it seem now to keep it and now to lose it scholars of

      the lowest class when they have heard about it laugh greatly at it if

      it were not thus laughed at it would not be fit to be the tao

    


       therefore the sentencemakers have thus expressed themselves

    


  the tao when brightest seen seems light to lack

   who progress in it makes seems drawing back

   its even way is like a rugged track

   its highest virtue from the vale doth rise

   its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes

   and he has most whose lot the least supplies

   its firmest virtue seems but poor and low

   its solid truth seems change to undergo

   its largest square doth yet no corner show

   a vessel great it is the slowest made

   loud is its sound but never word it said

   a semblance great the shadow of a shade




       the tao is hidden and has no name but it is the tao which is skilful

      at imparting to all things what they need and making them complete

    


        the tao produced one one produced two two produced three three

      produced all things all things leave behind them the obscurity out of

      which they have come and go forward to embrace the brightness into

      which they have emerged while they are harmonised by the breath of

      vacancy

    


       what men dislike is to be orphans to have little virtue to be as

      carriages without naves and yet these are the designations which kings

      and princes use for themselves so it is that some things are increased by

      being diminished and others are diminished by being increased

    


       what other men thus teach i also teach the violent and strong do

      not die their natural death i will make this the basis of my teaching

    


        the softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the

      hardest that which has no substantial existence enters where there is

      no crevice i know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing with a

      purpose

    


       there are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words

      and the advantage arising from nonaction

    


      

    


      

    


   or fame or life

     which do you hold more dear

   or life or wealth

     to which would you adhere

   keep life and lose those other things

   keep them and lose your lifewhich brings

     sorrow and pain more near




      

    


   thus we may see

     who cleaves to fame

     rejects what is more great

   who loves large stores

     gives up the richer state




      

    


   who is content

   needs fear no shame

   who knows to stop

   incurs no blame

   from danger free

   long live shall he




      

    


      

    


   who thinks his great achievements poor

   shall find his vigour long endure

   of greatest fulness deemed a void

   exhaustion neer shall stem the tide

   do thou whats straight still crooked deem

   thy greatest art still stupid seem

   and eloquence a stammering scream




       constant action overcomes cold being still overcomes heat purity and

      stillness give the correct law to all under heaven

    


        when the tao prevails in the world they send back their swift

      horses to draw the dungcarts when the tao is disregarded in the world

      the warhorses breed in the border lands

    


       there is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition no calamity

      greater than to be discontented with ones lot no fault greater than the

      wish to be getting therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an

      enduring and unchanging sufficiency

    


        without going outside his door one understands all that takes

      place under the sky without looking out from his window one sees the

      tao of heaven the farther that one goes out from himself the less he

      knows

    


       therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling gave their

      right names to things without seeing them and accomplished their ends

      without any purpose of doing so

    


        he who devotes himself to learning seeks from day to day to

      increase his knowledge he who devotes himself to the tao seeks from

      day to day to diminish his doing

    


       he diminishes it and again diminishes it till he arrives at doing

      nothing on purpose having arrived at this point of nonaction there is

      nothing which he does not do

    


       he who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no

      trouble with that end if one take trouble with that end he is not

      equal to getting as his own all under heaven

    


        the sage has no invariable mind of his own he makes the mind of

      the people his mind

    


       to those who are good to me i am good and to those who are not good

      to me i am also goodand thus all get to be good to those who

      are sincere with me i am sincere and to those who are not sincere

      with me i am also sincereand thus all get to be sincere

    


       the sage has in the world an appearance of indecision and keeps his

      mind in a state of indifference to all the people all keep their eyes and

      ears directed to him and he deals with them all as his children

    


        men come forth and live they enter again and die

    


       of every ten three are ministers of life to themselves and three are

      ministers of death

    


       there are also three in every ten whose aim is to live but whose

      movements tend to the land or place of death and for what reason

      because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life

    


       but i have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted

      to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or

      tiger and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp

      weapon the rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its

      horn nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws nor the weapon a

      place to admit its point and for what reason because there is in him no

      place of death

    


        all things are produced by the tao and nourished by its outflowing

      operation they receive their forms according to the nature of each and

      are completed according to the circumstances of their condition therefore

      all things without exception honour the tao and exalt its outflowing

      operation

    


       this honouring of the tao and exalting of its operation is not the

      result of any ordination but always a spontaneous tribute

    


       thus it is that the tao produces all things nourishes them brings

      them to their full growth nurses them completes them matures them

      maintains them and overspreads them

    


       it produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them it

      carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in

      doing so it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over themthis

      is called its mysterious operation

    


        the tao which originated all under the sky is to be considered as

      the mother of them all

    


       when the mother is found we know what her children should be when one

      knows that he is his mothers child and proceeds to guard the qualities

      of the mother that belong to him to the end of his life he will be free

      from all peril

    


       let him keep his mouth closed and shut up the portals of his

      nostrils and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion let

      him keep his mouth open and spend his breath in the promotion of his

      affairs and all his life there will be no safety for him

    


       the perception of what is small is the secret of clearsightedness

      the guarding of what is soft and tender is the secret of strength

    


      

    


   who uses well his light

   reverting to its source so bright

   will from his body ward all blight

   and hides the unchanging from mens sight




        if i were suddenly to become known and put into a position to

      conduct a government according to the great tao what i should be most

      afraid of would be a boastful display

    


       the great tao or way is very level and easy but people love the

      byways

    


       their courtyards and buildings shall be well kept but their fields

      shall be illcultivated and their granaries very empty they shall wear

      elegant and ornamented robes carry a sharp sword at their girdle pamper

      themselves in eating and drinking and have a superabundance of property

      and wealthsuch princes may be called robbers and boasters this

      is contrary to the tao surely

    


      

    


      

    


   what taos skilful planter plants

     can never be uptorn

   what his skilful arms enfold

     from him can neer be borne

   sons shall bring in lengthening line

   sacrifices to his shrine




      

    


   tao when nursed within ones self

     his vigour will make true

   and where the family it rules

     what riches will accrue

   the neighbourhood where it prevails

     in thriving will abound

   and when tis seen throughout the state

     good fortune will be found

   employ it the kingdom oer

     and men thrive all around




       in this way the effect will be seen in the person by the observation

      of different cases in the family in the neighbourhood in the state and

      in the kingdom

    


       how do i know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky

      by this method of observation

    


        he who has in himself abundantly the attributes of the tao is

      like an infant poisonous insects will not sting him fierce beasts will

      not seize him birds of prey will not strike him

    


       the infants bones are weak and its sinews soft but yet its grasp is

      firm it knows not yet the union of male and female and yet its virile

      member may be excitedshowing the perfection of its physical

      essence all day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarseshowing

      the harmony in its constitution

    


      

    


   to him by whom this harmony is known

   the secret of the unchanging tao is shown

   and in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne

   all lifeincreasing arts to evil turn

   where the mind makes the vital breath to burn

   false is the strength and oer it we should mourn




       when things have become strong they then become old which may be

      said to be contrary to the tao whatever is contrary to the tao soon ends

    


        he who knows the tao does not care to speak about it he who

      is ever ready to speak about it does not know it

    


       he who knows it will keep his mouth shut and close the portals of

      his nostrils he will blunt his sharp points and unravel the

      complications of things he will attemper his brightness and bring

      himself into agreement with the obscurity of others this is called the

      mysterious agreement

    


       such an one cannot be treated familiarly or distantly he is beyond

      all consideration of profit or injury of nobility or meannesshe

      is the noblest man under heaven

    


        a state may be ruled by measures of correction weapons of war

      may be used with crafty dexterity but the kingdom is made ones own

      only by freedom from action and purpose

    


       how do i know that it is so by these factsin the kingdom the

      multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the

      people the more implements to add to their profit that the people have

      the greater disorder is there in the state and clan the more acts of

      crafty dexterity that men possess the more do strange contrivances

      appear the more display there is of legislation the more thieves and

      robbers there are

    


       therefore a sage has said i will do nothing of purpose and the

      people will be transformed of themselves i will be fond of keeping still

      and the people will of themselves become correct i will take no trouble

      about it and the people will of themselves become rich i will manifest

      no ambition and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive

      simplicity

    


      

    


      

    


   the government that seems the most unwise

   oft goodness to the people best supplies

   that which is meddling touching everything

   will work but ill and disappointment bring




      miseryhappiness is to be found by its side happinessmisery

      lurks beneath it who knows what either will come to in the end

    


       shall we then dispense with correction the method of correction

      shall by a turn become distortion and the good in it shall by a turn

      become evil the delusion of the people on this point has indeed

      subsisted for a long time

    


       therefore the sage is like a square which cuts no one with its

      angles like a corner which injures no one with its sharpness he is

      straightforward but allows himself no license he is bright but does not

      dazzle

    


        for regulating the human in our constitution and rendering the

      proper service to the heavenly there is nothing like moderation

    


       it is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return

      to mans normal state that early return is what i call the repeated

      accumulation of the attributes of the tao with that repeated

      accumulation of those attributes there comes the subjugation of every

      obstacle to such return of this subjugation we know not what shall be

      the limit and when one knows not what the limit shall be he may be the

      ruler of a state

    


       he who possesses the mother of the state may continue long his case is

      like that of the plant of which we say that its roots are deep and its

      flower stalks firmthis is the way to secure that its enduring life

      shall long be seen

    


        governing a great state is like cooking small fish

    


       let the kingdom be governed according to the tao and the manes of the

      departed will not manifest their spiritual energy it is not that those

      manes have not that spiritual energy but it will not be employed to hurt

      men it is not that it could not hurt men but neither does the ruling

      sage hurt them

    


       when these two do not injuriously affect each other their good

      influences converge in the virtue of the tao

    


        what makes a great state is its being like a lowlying

      downflowing streamit becomes the centre to which tend all the

      small states under heaven

    


       to illustrate from the case of all femalesthe female always

      overcomes the male by her stillness stillness may be considered a sort

      of abasement

    


       thus it is that a great state by condescending to small states gains

      them for itself and that small states by abasing themselves to a great

      state win it over to them in the one case the abasement leads to gaining

      adherents in the other case to procuring favour

    


       the great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them a

      small state only wishes to be received by and to serve the other each

      gets what it desires but the great state must learn to abase itself

    


      

    


      

    


   tao has of all things the most honoured place

   no treasures give good men so rich a grace

   bad men it guards and doth their ill efface




       its admirable words can purchase honour its admirable deeds can

      raise their performer above others even men who are not good are not

      abandoned by it

    


       therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the son of heaven

      and he has appointed his three ducal ministers though a prince were to

      send in a round symbolofrank large enough to fill both the hands and

      that as the precursor of the team of horses in the courtyard such an

      offering would not be equal to a lesson of this tao which one might

      present on his knees

    


       why was it that the ancients prized this tao so much was it not

      because it could be got by seeking for it and the guilty could escape

      from the stain of their guilt by it this is the reason why all under

      heaven consider it the most valuable thing

    


        it is the way of the tao to act without thinking of acting to

      conduct affairs without feeling the trouble of them to taste without

      discerning any flavour to consider what is small as great and a few as

      many and to recompense injury with kindness

    


       the master of it anticipates things that are difficult while they are

      easy and does things that would become great while they are small all

      difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in

      which they were easy and all great things from one in which they were

      small therefore the sage while he never does what is great is able on

      that account to accomplish the greatest things

    


       he who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith he who is

      continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult therefore

      the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy and so never has any

      difficulties

    


        that which is at rest is easily kept hold of before a thing has

      given indications of its presence it is easy to take measures against it

      that which is brittle is easily broken that which is very small is easily

      dispersed action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance

      order should be secured before disorder has begun

    


       the tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout the tower

      of nine storeys rose from a small heap of earth the journey of a

      thousand li commenced with a single step

    


       he who acts with an ulterior purpose does harm he who takes hold of

      a thing in the same way loses his hold the sage does not act so and

      therefore does no harm he does not lay hold so and therefore does not

      lose his hold but people in their conduct of affairs are constantly

      ruining them when they are on the eve of success if they were careful at

      the end as they should be at the beginning they would not so ruin

      them

    


       therefore the sage desires what other men do not desire and does not

      prize things difficult to get he learns what other men do not learn

      and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by thus he helps

      the natural development of all things and does not dare to act with an

      ulterior purpose of his own

    


        the ancients who showed their skill in practising the tao did so

      not to enlighten the people but rather to make them simple and ignorant

    


       the difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much

      knowledge he who tries to govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to

      it while he who does not try to do so is a blessing

    


       he who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule

      ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the

      mysterious excellence of a governor deep and farreaching is such

      mysterious excellence showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others

      but leading them to a great conformity to him

    


        that whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and

      tribute of all the valley streams is their skill in being lower than

      theyit is thus that they are the kings of them all so it is that

      the sage ruler wishing to be above men puts himself by his words below

      them and wishing to be before them places his person behind them

    


       in this way though he has his place above them men do not feel his

      weight nor though he has his place before them do they feel it an injury

      to them

    


       therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of

      him because he does not strive no one finds it possible to strive with

      him

    


        all the world says that while my tao is great it yet appears to

      be inferior to other systems of teaching now it is just its greatness

      that makes it seem to be inferior if it were like any other system for

      long would its smallness have been known

    


       but i have three precious things which i prize and hold fast the first

      is gentleness the second is economy and the third is shrinking from

      taking precedence of others

    


       with that gentleness i can be bold with that economy i can be liberal

      shrinking from taking precedence of others i can become a vessel of the

      highest honour nowadays they give up gentleness and are all for being

      bold economy and are all for being liberal the hindmost place and seek

      only to be foremostof all which the end is death

    


       gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle and firmly to

      maintain its ground heaven will save its possessor by his very

      gentleness protecting him

    


      

    


    he who in taos wars has skill

      assumes no martial port

    he who fights with most good will

      to rage makes no resort

    he who vanquishes yet still

      keeps from his foes apart

    he whose hests men most fulfil

      yet humbly plies his art



    thus we say he neer contends

      and therein is his might

    thus we say mens wills he bends

      that they with him unite

    thus we say like heavens his ends

      no sage of old more bright




        a master of the art of war has said i do not dare to be the host

      to commence the war i prefer to be the guest to act on the defensive

      i do not dare to advance an inch i prefer to retire a foot this is

      called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks baring the arms to

      fight where there are no arms to bare grasping the weapon where there is

      no weapon to grasp advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy

    


       there is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war to do that

      is near losing the gentleness which is so precious thus it is that when

      opposing weapons are actually crossed he who deplores the situation

      conquers

    


        my words are very easy to know and very easy to practise but

      there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise

      them

    


       there is an originating and allcomprehending principle in my words

      and an authoritative law for the things which i enforce it is because

      they do not know these that men do not know me

    


       they who know me are few and i am on that account the more to be

      prized it is thus that the sage wears a poor garb of hair cloth while

      he carries his signet of jade in his bosom

    


        to know and yet think we do not know is the highest attainment

      not to know and yet think we do know is a disease

    


       it is simply by being pained at the thought of having this disease

      that we are preserved from it the sage has not the disease he knows the

      pain that would be inseparable from it and therefore he does not have it

    


        when the people do not fear what they ought to fear that which is

      their great dread will come on them

    


       let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life

      let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on

    


       it is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise

    


       therefore the sage knows these things of himself but does not parade

      his knowledge loves but does not appear to set a value on himself

      and thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the

      former

    


        he whose boldness appears in his daring to do wrong in defiance

      of the laws is put to death he whose boldness appears in his not daring

      to do so lives on of these two cases the one appears to be

      advantageous and the other to be injurious but

    


   when heavens anger smites a man

   who the cause shall truly scan




      on this account the sage feels a difficulty as to what to do in the

      former case

    


       it is the way of heaven not to strive and yet it skilfully overcomes

      not to speak and yet it is skilful in obtaining a reply does not call

      and yet men come to it of themselves its demonstrations are quiet and

      yet its plans are skilful and effective the meshes of the net of heaven

      are large far apart but letting nothing escape

    


        the people do not fear death to what purpose is it to try to

      frighten them with death if the people were always in awe of death and i

      could always seize those who do wrong and put them to death who would

      dare to do wrong

    


       there is always one who presides over the infliction of death he who

      would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be

      described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter seldom is it that

      he who undertakes the hewing instead of the great carpenter does not cut

      his own hands

    


        the people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes

      consumed by their superiors it is through this that they suffer famine

    


       the people are difficult to govern because of the excessive agency of

      their superiors in governing them it is through this that they are

      difficult to govern

    


       the people make light of dying because of the greatness of their

      labours in seeking for the means of living it is this which makes them

      think light of dying thus it is that to leave the subject of living

      altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it

    


        man at his birth is supple and weak at his death firm and strong

      so it is with all things trees and plants in their early growth are

      soft and brittle at their death dry and withered

    


       thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death

      softness and weakness the concomitants of life

    


       hence he who relies on the strength of his forces does not conquer

      and a tree which is strong will fill the outstretched arms and thereby

      invites the feller

    


       therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below and that of

      what is soft and weak is above

    


        may not the way or tao of heaven be compared to the method of

      bending a bow the part of the bow which was high is brought low and

      what was low is raised up so heaven diminishes where there is

      superabundance and supplements where there is deficiency

    


       it is the way of heaven to diminish superabundance and to supplement

      deficiency it is not so with the way of man he takes away from those who

      have not enough to add to his own superabundance

    


       who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under

      heaven only he who is in possession of the tao

    


       therefore the ruling sage acts without claiming the results as his

      he achieves his merit and does not rest arrogantly in ithe does

      not wish to display his superiority

    


        there is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water and

      yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that

      can take precedence of itfor there is nothing so effectual for

      which it can be changed

    


       every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard and the

      weak the strong but no one is able to carry it out in practice

    


      

    


   therefore a sage has said

  he who accepts his states reproach

     is hailed therefore its altars lord

   to him who bears mens direful woes

     they all the name of king accord




       words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical

    


        when a reconciliation is effected between two parties after a

      great animosity there is sure to be a grudge remaining in the mind of

      the one who was wrong and how can this be beneficial to the other

    


       therefore to guard against this the sage keeps the lefthand portion

      of the record of the engagement and does not insist on the speedy

      fulfilment of it by the other party so he who has the attributes of

      the tao regards only the conditions of the engagement while he who has

      not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself

    


       in the way of heaven there is no partiality of love it is always on

      the side of the good man

    


        in a little state with a small population i would so order it

      that though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred

      men there should be no employment of them i would make the people while

      looking on death as a grievous thing yet not remove elsewhere to avoid

      it

    


       though they had boats and carriages they should have no occasion to

      ride in them though they had buff coats and sharp weapons they should

      have no occasion to don or use them

    


       i would make the people return to the use of knotted cords instead of

      the written characters

    


       they should think their coarse food sweet their plain clothes

      beautiful their poor dwellings places of rest and their common

      simple ways sources of enjoyment

    


       there should be a neighbouring state within sight and the voices of

      the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us but i would

      make the people to old age even to death not have any intercourse with

      it

    


        sincere words are not fine fine words are not sincere those who

      are skilled in the tao do not dispute about it the disputatious are

      not skilled in it those who know the tao are not extensively learned

      the extensively learned do not know it

    


       the sage does not accumulate for himself the more that he expends

      for others the more does he possess of his own the more that he gives to

      others the more does he have himself

    


       with all the sharpness of the way of heaven it injures not with all

      the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive
