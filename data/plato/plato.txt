 introduction and analysis




the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exception of the

laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearer approaches to

modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the sophist the politicus or

statesman is more ideal the form and institutions of the state are more

clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art the symposium and the

protagoras are of higher excellence but no other dialogue of plato has the

same largeness of view and the same perfection of style no other shows an

equal knowledge of the world or contains more of those thoughts which are new

as well as old and not of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a

deeper irony or a greater wealth of humour or imagery or more dramatic power

nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and

speculation or to connect politics with philosophy the republic is the centre

around which the other dialogues may be grouped here philosophy reaches the

highest point cp especially in books v vi vii to which ancient thinkers

ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among the moderns was the

first who conceived a method of knowledge although neither of them always

distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth and both of

them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet

realized he was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen and

in him more than in any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge

are contained the sciences of logic and psychology which have supplied so

many instruments of thought to afterages are based upon the analyses of

socrates and plato the principles of definition the law of contradiction the

fallacy of arguing in a circle the distinction between the essence and

accidents of a thing or notion between means and ends between causes and

conditions also the division of the mind into the rational concupiscent and

irascible elements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and

unnecessarythese and other great forms of thought are all of them to be

found in the republic and were probably first invented by plato the greatest

of all logical truths and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt

to lose sight the difference between words and things has been most

strenuously insisted on by him cp rep polit cratyl   ff

although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings

eg rep but he does not bind up truth in logical formulaelogic is

still veiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines to

contemplate all truth and all existence is very unlike the

doctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered soph

elenchi  




neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part of a still

larger design which was to have included an ideal history of athens as well as

a political and physical philosophy the fragment of the critias has given

birth to a worldfamous fiction second only in importance to the tale of troy

and the legend of arthur and is said as a fact to have inspired some of the

early navigators of the sixteenth century this mythical tale of which the

subject was a history of the wars of the athenians against the island of

atlantis is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to which

it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to

the poems of homer it would have told of a struggle for liberty cp tim 

c intended to represent the conflict of persia and hellas we may judge from

the noble commencement of the timaeus from the fragment of the critias itself

and from the third book of the laws in what manner plato would have treated

this high argument we can only guess why the great design was abandoned

perhaps because plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious

history or because he had lost his interest in it or because advancing years

forbade the completion of it and we may please ourselves with the fancy that

had this imaginary narrative ever been finished we should have found plato

himself sympathising with the struggle for hellenic independence cp laws

iii  ff singing a hymn of triumph over marathon and salamis perhaps

making the reflection of herodotus v  where he contemplates the growth of

the athenian empirehow brave a thing is freedom of speech which

has made the athenians so far exceed every other state of hellas in

greatness or more probably attributing the victory to the ancient

good order of athens and to the favor of apollo and athene cp introd to

critias




again plato may be regarded as the captain

arhchegoz or leader of a goodly band of followers for in the

republic is to be found the original of ciceros de republica of st

augustines city of god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the

numerous other imaginary states which are framed upon the same model the

extent to which aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in

the politics has been little recognised and the recognition is the more

necessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the two philosophers had

more in common than they were conscious of and probably some elements of plato

remain still undetected in aristotle in english philosophy too many

affinities may be traced not only in the works of the cambridge platonists

but in great original writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his

ideas that there is a truth higher than experience of which the mind bears

witness to herself is a conviction which in our own generation has been

enthusiastically asserted and is perhaps gaining ground of the greek authors

who at the renaissance brought a new life into the world plato has had the

greatest influence the republic of plato is also the first treatise upon

education of which the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul and

goethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he has a

revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressed with the

unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised a real influence on

theology and at the revival of literature on politics even the fragments of

his words when repeated at secondhand symp  d have in all

ages ravished the hearts of men who have seen reflected in them their own

higher nature he is the father of idealism in philosophy in politics in

literature and many of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and

statesmen such as the unity of knowledge the reign of law and the equality

of the sexes have been anticipated in a dream by him




the argument of the republic is the search after justice the nature of which

is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless old manthen

discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socrates and

polemarchusthen caricatured by thrasymachus and partially explained by

socratesreduced to an abstraction by glaucon and adeimantus and having

become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal state which

is constructed by socrates the first care of the rulers is to be education of

which an outline is drawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an

improved religion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic a

manlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual and the state

we are thus led on to the conception of a higher state in which no man

calls anything his own and in which there is neither marrying

nor giving in marriage and kings are philosophers and

philosophers are kings and there is another and higher

education intellectual as well as moral and religious of science as well as

of art and not of youth only but of the whole of life such a state is hardly

to be realized in this world and quickly degenerates to the perfect ideal

succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honour this again

declining into democracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but

regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the

wheel has come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of

human life but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we end

the subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which

had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the republic is now

resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetry is discovered to be an imitation

thrice removed from the truth and homer as well as the dramatic poets having

been condemned as an imitator is sent into banishment along with them and the

idea of the state is supplemented by the revelation of a future life




the division into books like all similar divisions cp sir gc lewis in the

classical museum vol ii p  is probably later than the age of plato the

natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of

book ii down to the paragraph beginning i had always admired the genius

of glaucon and adeimantus which is introductory the first book

containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice and

concluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving at any

definite result to this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice

according to common opinion and an answer is demanded to the

questionwhat is justice stripped of appearances the second division

 includes the remainder of the second and the whole of the third and fourth

books which are mainly occupied with the construction of the first state and

the first education the third division  consists of the fifth sixth and

seventh books in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject of

enquiry and the second state is constructed on principles of communism and

ruled by philosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes the

place of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninth books 

the perversions of states and of the individuals who correspond to them are

reviewed in succession and the nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny

are further analysed in the individual man the tenth book  is the

conclusion of the whole in which the relations of philosophy to poetry are

finally determined and the happiness of the citizens in this life which has

now been assured is crowned by the vision of another




or a more general division into two parts may be adopted the first books i 

iv containing the description of a state framed generally in accordance with

hellenic notions of religion and morality while in the second books v  x

the hellenic state is transformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which

all other governments are the perversions these two points of view are really

opposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato the

republic like the phaedrus see introduction to phaedrus is an imperfect

whole the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the

hellenic temple which at last fades away into the heavens whether this

imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from the

imperfect reconcilement in the writers own mind of the struggling

elements of thought which are now first brought together by him or perhaps

from the composition of the work at different timesare questions like

the similar question about the iliad and the odyssey which are worth asking

but which cannot have a distinct answer in the age of plato there was no

regular mode of publication and an author would have the less scruple in

altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his friends

there is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for

a time or turned from one work to another and such interruptions would be

more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing in all

attempts to determine the chronological order of the platonic writings on

internal evidence this uncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at

one time is a disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer

works such as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on the

other hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only arise out of the

discordant elements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in a single

whole perhaps without being himself able to recognise the inconsistency which

is obvious to us for there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers

have ever been able to anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want

of connexion in their own writings or the gaps in their systems which are

visible enough to those who come after them in the beginnings of literature

and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought and language more

inconsistencies occur than now when the paths of speculation are well worn and

the meaning of words precisely defined for consistency too is the growth of

time and some of the greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in

unity tried by this test several of the platonic dialogues according to our

modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is no proof that they

were composed at different times or by different hands and the supposition

that the republic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in

some degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the work to

another




the second title concerning justice is not the one by which the

republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in antiquity and like

the other second titles of the platonic dialogues may therefore be assumed to

be of later date morgenstern and others have asked whether the definition of

justice which is the professed aim or the construction of the state is the

principal argument of the work the answer is that the two blend in one and

are two faces of the same truth for justice is the order of the state and the

state is the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human

society the one is the soul and the other is the body and the greek ideal of

the state as of the individual is a fair mind in a fair body in hegelian

phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the idea or

described in christian language the kingdom of god is within and yet

developes into a church or external kingdom the house not made with

hands eternal in the heavens is reduced to the proportions of an

earthly building or to use a platonic image justice and the state are the

warp and the woof which run through the whole texture and when the

constitution of the state is completed the conception of justice is not

dismissed but reappears under the same or different names throughout the work

both as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as the principle of

rewards and punishments in another life the virtues are based on justice of

which common honesty in buying and selling is the shadow and justice is based

on the idea of good which is the harmony of the world and is reflected both

in the institutions of states and in motions of the heavenly bodies cp tim

 the timaeus which takes up the political rather than the ethical side of

the republic and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward

world yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reign

over the state over nature and over man




too much however has been made of this question both in ancient and modern

times there is a stage of criticism in which all works whether of nature or

of art are referred to design now in ancient writings and indeed in

literature generally there remains often a large element which was not

comprehended in the original design for the plan grows under the

authors hand new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing he has

not worked out the argument to the end before he begins the reader who seeks

to find some one idea under which the whole may be conceived must necessarily

seize on the vaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with

the ordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagines himself to

have found the true argument in the representation of human life in a

state perfected by justice and governed according to the idea of good

there may be some use in such general descriptions but they can hardly be said

to express the design of the writer the truth is that we may as well speak of

many designs as of one nor need anything be excluded from the plan of a great

work to which the mind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which

does not interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unity is to

be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in poetry in prose is a

problem which has to be determined relatively to the subjectmatter to plato

himself the enquiry what was the intention of the writer or

what was the principal argument of the republic would have been

hardly intelligible and therefore had better be at once dismissed cp the

introduction to the phaedrus




is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which to

platos own mind are most naturally represented in the form of the

state just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or the day

of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or the

sun of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us

at least their great spiritual ideals so through the greek state plato

reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which is the idea of

goodlike the sun in the visible worldabout human perfection

which is justiceabout education beginning in youth and continuing in

later yearsabout poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false

teachers and evil rulers of mankindabout the world which

is the embodiment of themabout a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth

but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life no such

inspired creation is at unity with itself any more than the clouds of heaven

when the sun pierces through them every shade of light and dark of truth and

of fiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work of philosophical

imagination it is not all on the same plane it easily passes from ideas to

myths and fancies from facts to figures of speech it is not prose but poetry

at least a great part of it and ought not to be judged by the rules of logic

or the probabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideas into an

artistic whole they take possession of him and are too much for him we have

no need therefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has conceived is

practicable or not or whether the outward form or the inward life came first

into the mind of the writer for the practicability of his ideas has nothing to

do with their truth and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly

said to bear the greatest marks of designjustice more than

the external framework of the state the idea of good more than justice the

great science of dialectic or the organisation of ideas has no real content

but is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to

be pursued by the spectator of all time and all existence it is in the fifth

sixth and seventh books that plato reaches the summit of

speculation and these although they fail to satisfy the requirements

of a modern thinker may therefore be regarded as the most important as they

are also the most original portions of the work




it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has been raised

by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at which the conversation was held

the year  bc which is proposed by him will do as well as any other for

a writer of fiction and especially a writer who like plato is notoriously

careless of chronology cp rep symp  a etc only aims at general

probability whether all the persons mentioned in the republic could ever have

met at any one time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an

athenian reading the work forty years later or to plato himself at the time of

writing any more than to shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and

need not greatly trouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer

which is still worth asking because the investigation shows that

we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be useless

therefore to waste time in inventing farfetched reconcilements of them in

order to avoid chronological difficulties such for example as the conjecture

of cf hermann that glaucon and adeimantus are not the brothers but the

uncles of plato cp apol  a or the fancy of stallbaum that plato

intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of his

dialogues were written




the principal characters in the republic are cephalus polemarchus

thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalus appears in the

introduction only polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument and

thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book the main

discussion is carried on by socrates glaucon and adeimantus among the

company are lysias the orator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and

brothers of polemarchus an unknown charmantidesthese are mute auditors

also there is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialogue which

bears his name he appears as the friend and ally of thrasymachus




cephalus the patriarch of the house has been appropriately engaged in

offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who has almost done with

life and is at peace with himself and with all mankind he feels that he is

drawing nearer to the world below and seems to linger around the memory of the

past he is eager that socrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of

the last generation happy in the consciousness of a wellspent life glad at

having escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love of conversation

his affection his indifference to riches even his garrulity are interesting

traits of character he is not one of those who have nothing to say because

their whole mind has been absorbed in making money yet he acknowledges that

riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to dishonesty or

falsehood the respectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love of

conversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the oracle leads

him to ask questions of all men young and old alike should also be noted who

better suited to raise the question of justice than cephalus whose life might

seem to be the expression of it the moderation with which old age is pictured

by cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic not

only of him but of greek feeling generally and contrasts with the

exaggeration of cicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described by

plato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possible touches as

cicero remarks ep ad attic iv  the aged cephalus would have been out of

place in the discussion which follows and which he could neither have

understood nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety cp

lysimachus in the laches




his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness

of youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the opening scene and will

not let him off on the subject of women and children like

cephalus he is limited in his point of view and represents the proverbial

stage of morality which has rules of life rather than principles and he quotes

simonides cp aristoph clouds as his father had quoted pindar but after

this he has no more to say the answers which he makes are only elicited from

him by the dialectic of socrates he has not yet experienced the influence of

the sophists like glaucon and adeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity

of refuting them he belongs to the presocratic or predialectical age he is

incapable of arguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he

does not know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is a thief

and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from his brother lysias

contra eratosth we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty tyrants but no

allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance that cephalus and

his family were of syracusan origin and had migrated from thurii to athens




the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have already

heard in the phaedrus is the personification of the sophists according to

platos conception of them in some of their worst characteristics he is

vain and blustering refusing to discourse unless he is paid fond of making an

oration and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable socrates but a mere child

in argument and unable to foresee that the next move to use a

platonic expression will shut him up he has reached the stage

of framing general notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus and

polemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a discussion and vainly

tries to cover his confusion with banter and insolence whether such doctrines

as are attributed to him by plato were really held either by him or by any

other sophist is uncertain in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about

morality might easily grow upthey are certainly put into the mouths of

speakers in thucydides but we are concerned at present with platos

description of him and not with the historical reality the inequality of the

contest adds greatly to the humour of the scene the pompous and empty sophist

is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic who knows

how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him he is greatly

irritated by the irony of socrates but his noisy and imbecile rage only lays

him more and more open to the thrusts of his assailant his determination to

cram down their throats or put bodily into their souls his own

words elicits a cry of horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite

as worthy of remark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing

than his complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten at first

he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soon with apparent

goodwill and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two

occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he is humorously protected by

socrates as one who has never been his enemy and is now his

friend from cicero and quintilian and from aristotles rhetoric

we learn that the sophist whom plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note

whose writings were preserved in later ages the play on his name which was

made by his contemporary herodicus aris rhet thou wast ever bold in

battle seems to show that the description of him is not devoid of

verisimilitude




when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principal respondents glaucon and

adeimantus appear on the scene here as in greek tragedy cp introd to

phaedo three actors are introduced at first sight the two sons of ariston

may seem to wear a family likeness like the two friends simmias and cebes in

the phaedo but on a nearer examination of them the similarity vanishes and

they are seen to be distinct characters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can

just never have enough of fechting cp the character of him in

xen mem iii  the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of

love the juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed

of animals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of youthful

life he is full of quickness and penetration piercing easily below the clumsy

platitudes of thrasymachus to the real difficulty he turns out to the light

the seamy side of human life and yet does not lose faith in the just and true

it is glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the

philosopher to the world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of

pigs who is always prepared with a jest when the argument offers him an

opportunity and who is ever ready to second the humour of socrates and to

appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music or in the

lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of

democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded to by socrates who

however will not allow him to be attacked by his brother adeimantus he is a

soldier and like adeimantus has been distinguished at the battle of megara

anno the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the

profounder objections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is more

demonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues the argument

further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth

adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grownup man of the world in the

second book when glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be

considered without regard to their consequences adeimantus remarks that they

are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences and

in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book

that socrates fails in making his citizens happy and is answered that

happiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aim but the

indirect consequence of the good government of a state in the discussion about

religion and mythology adeimantus is the respondent but glaucon breaks in

with a slight jest and carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about

music and gymnastic to the end of the book it is adeimantus again who

volunteers the criticism of common sense on the socratic method of argument

and who refuses to let socrates pass lightly over the question of women and

children it is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative as

glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the dialogue for

example throughout the greater part of the sixth book the causes of the

corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of good are discussed

with adeimantus glaucon resumes his place of principal respondent but he has

a difficulty in apprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some

false hits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returns with

the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to the contentious state

in the next book he is again superseded and glaucon continues to the end




thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successive stages of

morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the olden time who is

followed by the practical man of that day regulating his life by proverbs and

saws to him succeeds the wild generalization of the sophists and lastly come

the young disciples of the great teacher who know the sophistical arguments

but will not be convinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature of

things these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus are clearly

distinguished from one another neither in the republic nor in any other

dialogue of plato is a single character repeated




the delineation of socrates in the republic is not wholly consistent in the

first book we have more of the real socrates such as he is depicted in the

memorabilia of xenophon in the earliest dialogues of plato and in the

apology he is ironical provoking questioning the old enemy of the sophists

ready to put on the mask of silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the

sixth book his enmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they

are the representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he also

becomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the range either of the

political or the speculative ideas of the real socrates in one passage plato

himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for socrates who had

passed his whole life in philosophy to give his own opinion and not to be

always repeating the notions of other men there is no evidence that either the

idea of good or the conception of a perfect state were comprehended in the

socratic teaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal and

of final causes cp xen mem phaedo and a deep thinker like him in his

thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardly have failed to touch on

the nature of family relations for which there is also some positive evidence

in the memorabilia mem the socratic method is nominally retained and every

inference is either put into the mouth of the respondent or represented as the

common discovery of him and socrates but any one can see that this is a mere

form of which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances the method

of enquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help of

interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points of view the

nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when he describes

himself as a companion who is not good for much in an investigation but can

see what he is shown and may perhaps give the answer to a question more

fluently than another




neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taught the

immortality of the soul which is unknown to his disciple glaucon in the

republic cp apol nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or

revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction or that he would have

banished poetry or have denounced the greek mythology his favorite oath is

retained and a slight mention is made of the daemonium or internal sign

which is alluded to by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real

element of socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic than in

any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example and illustration

 





let us apply the test of common instances you

says adeimantus ironically in the sixth book are so unaccustomed to

speak in images and this use of examples or images though truly

socratic in origin is enlarged by the genius of plato into the form of an

allegory or parable which embodies in the concrete what has been already

described or is about to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the

cave in book vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book vi

the composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of the soul the

noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi are a figure of the

relation of the people to the philosophers in the state which has been

described other figures such as the dog or the marriage of the portionless

maiden or the drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books also form links

of connexion in long passages or are used to recall previous discussions




plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him as

not of this world and with this representation of him the ideal

state and the other paradoxes of the republic are quite in accordance though

they cannot be shown to have been speculations of socrates to him as to other

great teachers both philosophical and religious when they looked upward the

world seemed to be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of

mankind has revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it and

even in socrates himself the sterner judgement of the multitude at times passes

into a sort of ironical pity or love men in general are incapable of

philosophy and are therefore at enmity with the philosopher but their

misunderstanding of him is unavoidable for they have never seen him as he

truly is in his own image they are only acquainted with artificial systems

possessing no native force of truthwords which admit of many

applications their leaders have nothing to measure with and are therefore

ignorant of their own stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to

be quarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they could only

learn that they are cutting off a hydras head this moderation towards

those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features of socrates

in the republic in all the different representations of socrates whether of

xenophon or plato and amid the differences of the earlier or later dialogues

he always retains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after

truth without which he would have ceased to be socrates




leaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the republic and

then proceed to consider  the general aspects of this hellenic ideal of the

state  the modern lights in which the thoughts of plato may be read




book i the republic opens with a truly greek scenea festival in honour

of the goddess bendis which is held in the piraeus to this is added the

promise of an equestrian torchrace in the evening the whole work is supposed

to be recited by socrates on the day after the festival to a small party

consisting of critias timaeus hermocrates and another this we learn from

the first words of the timaeus




when the rhetorical advantage of reciting the dialogue has been gained the

attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience nor is the reader

further reminded of the extraordinary length of the narrative of the numerous

company three only take any serious part in the discussion nor are we

informed whether in the evening they went to the torchrace or talked as in

the symposium through the night the manner in which the conversation has

arisen is described as followssocrates and his companion glaucon are

about to leave the festival when they are detained by a message from

polemarchus who speedily appears accompanied by adeimantus the brother of

glaucon and with playful violence compels them to remain promising them not

only the torchrace but the pleasure of conversation with the young which to

socrates is a far greater attraction they return to the house of cephalus

polemarchus father now in extreme old age who is found sitting upon a

cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice you should come to me oftener

socrates for i am too old to go to you and at my time of life having lost

other pleasures i care the more for conversation socrates asks him

what he thinks of age to which the old man replies that the sorrows and

discontents of age are to be attributed to the tempers of men and that age is

a time of peace in which the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt yes

replies socrates but the world will say cephalus that you are happy in old

age because you are rich and there is something in what they say

socrates but not so much as they imagineas themistocles replied to the

seriphian neither you if you had been an athenian nor i if i had

been a seriphian would ever have been famous i might in like manner

reply to you neither a good poor man can be happy in age nor yet a bad rich

man socrates remarks that cephalus appears not to care about riches a

quality which he ascribes to his having inherited not acquired them and would

like to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them cephalus

answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon you and

then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to do injustice

through poverty and never to have deceived anyone are felt to be unspeakable

blessings socrates who is evidently preparing for an argument next asks

what is the meaning of the word justice to tell the truth and pay your debts

no more than this or must we admit exceptions ought i for example to put

back into the hands of my friend who has gone mad the sword which i borrowed

of him when he was in his right mind there must be exceptions

and yet says polemarchus the definition which has been

given has the authority of simonides here cephalus retires to look

after the sacrifices and bequeaths as socrates facetiously remarks the

possession of the argument to his heir polemarchus




the description of old age is finished and plato as his manner is has

touched the keynote of the whole work in asking for the definition of justice

first suggesting the question which glaucon afterwards pursues respecting

external goods and preparing for the concluding mythus of the world below in

the slight allusion of cephalus the portrait of the just man is a natural

frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse which follows and may

perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about the nature of justice there is

no difficulty in discerning who is a just man the first

explanation has been supported by a saying of simonides and now socrates has a

mind to show that the resolution of justice into two unconnected precepts

which have no common principle fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic




he proceeds what did simonides mean by this saying of his did he mean that

i was to give back arms to a madman no not in that case not if the

parties are friends and evil would result he meant that you were to do what

was proper good to friends and harm to enemies every act does

something to somebody and following this analogy socrates asks what is this

due and proper thing which justice does and to whom he is answered that

justice does good to friends and harm to enemies but in what way good or harm

in making alliances with the one and going to war with the

other then in time of peace what is the good of justice the answer is

that justice is of use in contracts and contracts are money partnerships yes

but how in such partnerships is the just man of more use than any other man

when you want to have money safely kept and not used then

justice will be useful when money is useless and there is another difficulty

justice like the art of war or any other art must be of opposites good at

attack as well as at defence at stealing as well as at guarding but then

justice is a thief though a hero notwithstanding like autolycus the homeric

hero who was excellent above all men in theft and

perjuryto such a pass have you and homer and simonides brought

us though i do not forget that the thieving must be for the good of friends

and the harm of enemies and still there arises another question are friends

to be interpreted as real or seeming enemies as real or seeming and are our

friends to be only the good and our enemies to be the evil the answer is

that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends and evil to our

seeming and real evil enemiesgood to the good evil to the evil but

ought we to render evil for evil at all when to do so will only make men more

evil can justice produce injustice any more than the art of horsemanship can

make bad horsemen or heat produce cold the final conclusion is that no sage

or poet ever said that the just return evil for evil this was a maxim of some

rich and mighty man periander perdiccas or ismenias the theban about bc






thus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to be

inadequate to the wants of the age the authority of the poets is set aside

and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an approach to the christian

precept of forgiveness of injuries similar words are applied by the persian

mystic poet to the divine being when the questioning spirit is stirred within

himif because i do evil thou punishest me by evil what is the

difference between thee and me in this both plato and kheyam rise above

the level of many christian  theologians the first definition of justice

easily passes into the second for the simple words to speak the truth

and pay your debts is substituted the more abstract to do good to

your friends and harm to your enemies either of these explanations

gives a sufficient rule of life for plain men but they both fall short of the

precision of philosophy we may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry

which not only arises out of the conflict of established principles in

particular cases but also out of the effort to attain them and is prior as

well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality the

interrogation of moral ideas the appeal to the authority of

homer the conclusion that the maxim do good to your friends and harm

to your enemies being erroneous could not have been the word of any

great man are all of them very characteristic of the platonic socrates




here thrasymachus who has made several attempts to interrupt but has

hitherto been kept in order by the company takes advantage of a pause and

rushes into the arena beginning like a savage animal with a roar

socrates he says what folly is thiswhy do you

agree to be vanquished by one another in a pretended argument he then

prohibits all the ordinary definitions of justice to which socrates replies

that he cannot tell how many twelve is if he is forbidden to say  x  or  x

 or  x  or  x  at first thrasymachus is reluctant to argue but at

length with a promise of payment on the part of the company and of praise from

socrates he is induced to open the game listen he says

my answer is that might is right justice the interest of the stronger

now praise me let me understand you first do you mean that because

polydamas the wrestler who is stronger than we are finds the eating of beef

for his interest the eating of beef is also for our interest who are not so

strong thrasymachus is indignant at the illustration and in pompous words

apparently intended to restore dignity to the argument he explains his meaning

to be that the rulers make laws for their own interests but suppose says

socrates that the ruler or stronger makes a mistakethen the interest of

the stronger is not his interest thrasymachus is saved from this speedy

downfall by his disciple cleitophon who introduces the word

thinksnot the actual interest of the ruler but what he

thinks or what seems to be his interest is justice the contradiction is

escaped by the unmeaning evasion for though his real and apparent interests

may differ what the ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain what he

thinks to be his interest




of course this was not the original assertion nor is the new interpretation

accepted by thrasymachus himself but socrates is not disposed to quarrel about

words if as he significantly insinuates his adversary has changed his mind

in what follows thrasymachus does in fact withdraw his admission that the ruler

may make a mistake for he affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible

socrates is quite ready to accept the new position which he equally turns

against thrasymachus by the help of the analogy of the arts every art or

science has an interest but this interest is to be distinguished from the

accidental interest of the artist and is only concerned with the good of the

things or persons which come under the art and justice has an interest which

is the interest not of the ruler or judge but of those who come under his

sway




thrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion when he makes a bold

diversion tell me socrates he says have you a

nurse what a question why do you ask because if you have she

neglects you and lets you go about drivelling and has not even taught you to

know the shepherd from the sheep for you fancy that shepherds and rulers never

think of their own interest but only of their sheep or subjects whereas the

truth is that they fatten them for their use sheep and subjects alike and

experience proves that in every relation of life the just man is the loser and

the unjust the gainer especially where injustice is on the grand scale which

is quite another thing from the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and

robbers of temples the language of men proves thisour

gracious and blessed tyrant and the likeall

which tends to show  that justice is the interest of the stronger and 

that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice




thrasymachus who is better at a speech than at a close argument having

deluged the company with words has a mind to escape but the others will not

let him go and socrates adds a humble but earnest request that he will not

desert them at such a crisis of their fate and what can i do more for

you he says would you have me put the words bodily into your

souls god forbid replies socrates but we want you to be consistent in

the use of terms and not to employ physician in an exact sense

and then again shepherd or ruler in an

inexactif the words are strictly taken the ruler and the shepherd look

only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own whereas you

insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office no doubt about

it replies thrasymachus then why are they paid is not the reason

that their interest is not comprehended in their art and is therefore the

concern of another art the art of pay which is common to the arts in general

and therefore not identical with any one of them nor would any man be a ruler

unless he were induced by the hope of reward or the fear of

punishmentthe reward is money or honour the punishment is the

necessity of being ruled by a man worse than himself and if a state or

church were composed entirely of good men they would be affected by the last

motive only and there would be as much nolo episcopari as there

is at present of the opposite




the satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and apparently

incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced there is a similar

irony in the argument that the governors of mankind do not like being in

office and that therefore they demand pay




enough of this the other assertion of thrasymachus is far more

importantthat the unjust life is more gainful than the just now as you

and i glaucon are not convinced by him we must reply to him but if we try

to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to decide for us we

had better therefore proceed by making mutual admissions of the truth to one

another




thrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than perfect

justice and after a little hesitation he is induced by socrates to admit the

still greater paradox that injustice is virtue and justice vice socrates

praises his frankness and assumes the attitude of one whose only wish is to

understand the meaning of his opponents at the same time he is weaving a net

in which thrasymachus is finally enclosed the admission is elicited from him

that the just man seeks to gain an advantage over the unjust only but not over

the just while the unjust would gain an advantage over either socrates in

order to test this statement employs once more the favourite analogy of the

arts the musician doctor skilled artist of any sort does not seek to gain

more than the skilled but only more than the unskilled that is to say he

works up to a rule standard law and does not exceed it whereas the

unskilled makes random efforts at excess thus the skilled falls on the side of

the good and the unskilled on the side of the evil and the just is the

skilled and the unjust is the unskilled




there was great difficulty in bringing thrasymachus to the point the day was

hot and he was streaming with perspiration and for the first time in his life

he was seen to blush but his other thesis that injustice was stronger than

justice has not yet been refuted and socrates now proceeds to the

consideration of this which with the assistance of thrasymachus he hopes to

clear up the latter is at first churlish but in the judicious hands of

socrates is soon restored to goodhumour is there not honour among thieves is

not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice is not absolute

injustice absolute weakness also a house that is divided against itself cannot

stand two men who quarrel detract from one anothers strength and he

who is at war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods not wickedness

therefore but semiwickedness flourishes in statesa remnant of good is

needed in order to make union in action possiblethere is no kingdom of

evil in this world




another question has not been answered is the just or the unjust the happier

to this we reply that every art has an end and an excellence or virtue by

which the end is accomplished and is not the end of the soul happiness and

justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained justice and

happiness being thus shown to be inseparable the question whether the just or

the unjust is the happier has disappeared




thrasymachus replies let this be your entertainment socrates at the

festival of bendis yes and a very good entertainment with which your

kindness has supplied me now that you have left off scolding and yet not a

good entertainmentbut that was my own fault for i tasted of too many

things first of all the nature of justice was the subject of our enquiry and

then whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly and then the

comparative advantages of just and unjust and the sum of all is that i know

not what justice is how then shall i know whether the just is happy or not




thus the sophistical fabric has been demolished chiefly by appealing to the

analogy of the arts justice is like the arts  in having no external

interest and  in not aiming at excess and  justice is to happiness what

the implement of the workman is to his work at this the modern reader

is apt to stumble because he forgets that plato is writing in an age when the

arts and the virtues like the moral and intellectual faculties were still

undistinguished among early enquirers into the nature of human action the arts

helped to fill up the void of speculation and at first the comparison of the

arts and the virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious they only saw

the points of agreement in them and not the points of difference virtue like

art must take means to an end good manners are both an art and a virtue

character is naturally described under the image of a statue and there are

many other figures of speech which are readily transferred from art to morals

the next generation cleared up these perplexities or at least supplied after

ages with a further analysis of them the contemporaries of plato were in a

state of transition and had not yet fully realized the commonsense

distinction of aristotle that virtue is concerned with action art with

production nic eth or that virtue implies intention and

constancy of purpose whereas art requires knowledge only

and yet in the absurdities which follow from some uses of the analogy there

seems to be an intimation conveyed that virtue is more than art this is

implied in the reductio ad absurdum that justice is a thief and

in the dissatisfaction which socrates expresses at the final result




the expression an art of pay which is described as common

to all the arts is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language

nor is it employed elsewhere either by plato or by any other greek writer it

is suggested by the argument and seems to extend the conception of art to

doing as well as making another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be noted in

the words men who are injured are made more unjust for those who

are injured are not necessarily made worse but only harmed or illtreated




the second of the three arguments that the just does not aim at

excess has a real meaning though wrapped up in an enigmatical form

that the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly hellenic

sentiment which may be compared with the language of those modern writers who

speak of virtue as fitness and of freedom as obedience to law the

mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an ethical one and

even finds a mythological expression in the conception of envy greek ideas

of measure equality order unity proportion still linger in the writings of

moralists and the true spirit of the fine arts is better conveyed by such

terms than by superlatives




when workmen strive to do better than well

they do confound their skill in covetousness king john act iv sc






the harmony of the soul and body and of the parts of the soul with one

another a harmony fairer than that of musical notes is the true

hellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature




in what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with thrasymachus plato

argues that evil is not a principle of strength but of discord and

dissolution just touching the question which has been often treated in modern

times by theologians and philosophers of the negative nature of evil in the

last argument we trace the germ of the aristotelian doctrine of an end and a

virtue directed towards the end which again is suggested by the arts the

final reconcilement of justice and happiness and the identity of the individual

and the state are also intimated socrates reassumes the character of a

knownothing at the same time he appears to be not wholly

satisfied with the manner in which the argument has been conducted nothing is

concluded but the tendency of the dialectical process here as always is to

enlarge our conception of ideas and to widen their application to human life




book ii thrasymachus is pacified but the intrepid glaucon insists on

continuing the argument he is not satisfied with the indirect manner in which

at the end of the last book socrates had disposed of the question

whether the just or the unjust is the happier he begins by

dividing goods into three classesfirst goods desirable in themselves

secondly goods desirable in themselves and for their results thirdly goods

desirable for their results only he then asks socrates in which of the three

classes he would place justice in the second class replies socrates among

goods desirable for themselves and also for their results then the

world in general are of another mind for they say that justice belongs to the

troublesome class of goods which are desirable for their results only socrates

answers that this is the doctrine of thrasymachus which he rejects glaucon

thinks that thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer

and proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in themselves and

apart from the results and rewards of them which the world is always dinning in

his ears he will first of all speak of the nature and origin of justice

secondly of the manner in which men view justice as a necessity and not a

good and thirdly he will prove the reasonableness of this view




to do injustice is said to be a good to suffer injustice an evil as

the evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good the

sufferers who cannot also be doers make a compact that they will have

neither and this compact or mean is called justice but is really the

impossibility of doing injustice no one would observe such a compact if he

were not obliged let us suppose that the just and unjust have two rings like

that of gyges in the wellknown story which make them invisible and then no

difference will appear in them for every one will do evil if he can and he

who abstains will be regarded by the world as a fool for his pains men may

praise him in public out of fear for themselves but they will laugh at him in

their hearts cp gorgias




and now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust imagine the unjust

man to be master of his craft seldom making mistakes and easily correcting

them having gifts of money speech strengththe greatest villain

bearing the highest character and at his side let us place the just in his

nobleness and simplicitybeing not seemingwithout name or

rewardclothed in his justice onlythe best of men who is thought

to be the worst and let him die as he has lived i might add but i would

rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of injusticethey

will tell you that the just man will be scourged racked bound will have his

eyes put out and will at last be crucified literally impaledand all

this because he ought to have preferred seeming to being how different is the

case of the unjust who clings to appearance as the true reality his high

character makes him a ruler he can marry where he likes trade where he likes

help his friends and hurt his enemies having got rich by dishonesty he can

worship the gods better and will therefore be more loved by them than the

just




i was thinking what to answer when adeimantus joined in the already unequal

fray he considered that the most important point of all had been

omittedmen are taught to be just for the sake of rewards

parents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue and other

advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind such as wealthy marriages

and high offices there are the pictures in homer and hesiod of fat sheep and

heavy fleeces rich cornfields and trees toppling with fruit which the gods

provide in this life for the just and the orphic poets add a similar picture

of another the heroes of musaeus and eumolpus lie on couches at a festival

with garlands on their heads enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of

immortal drunkenness some go further and speak of a fair posterity in the

third and fourth generation but the wicked they bury in a slough and make them

carry water in a sieve and in this life they attribute to them the infamy

which glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just who are supposed to be

unjust




take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and

prosevirtue as hesiod says is honourable but

difficult vice is easy and profitable you may often see the wicked in

great prosperity and the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven and

mendicant prophets knock at rich mens doors promising to atone for the

sins of themselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and

festive games or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy good or

bad by divine help and at a small chargethey appeal to books professing

to be written by musaeus and orpheus and carry away the minds of whole cities

and promise to get souls out of purgatory and if we refuse to

listen to them no one knows what will happen to us




when a livelyminded ingenuous youth hears all this what will be his

conclusion will he in the language of pindar make

justice his high tower or fortify himself with crooked deceit justice

he reflects without the appearance of justice is misery and ruin injustice

has the promise of a glorious life appearance is master of truth and lord of

happiness to appearance then i will turni will put on the show of

virtue and trail behind me the fox of archilochus i hear some one saying that

wickedness is not easily concealed to which i reply that

nothing great is easy union and force and rhetoric will do much

and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods still how do we know

that there are gods only from the poets who acknowledge that they may be

appeased by sacrifices then why not sin and pay for indulgences out of your

sin for if the righteous are only unpunished still they have no further

reward while the wicked may be unpunished and have the pleasure of sinning

too but what of the world below nay says the argument there are atoning

powers who will set that matter right as the poets who are the sons of the

gods tell us and this is confirmed by the authority of the state




how can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice add good

manners and as the wise tell us we shall make the best of both worlds who

that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling at the praises of

justice even if a man knows the better part he will not be angry with others

for he knows also that more than human virtue is needed to save a man and that

he only praises justice who is incapable of injustice




the origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning heroes

poets instructors of youth have always asserted the temporal

dispensation the honours and profits of justice had we been taught in

early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul and unseen

by any human or divine eye we should not have needed others to be our

guardians but every one would have been the guardian of himself this is what

i want you to show socratesother men use arguments which rather tend

to strengthen the position of thrasymachus that might is right

but from you i expect better things and please as glaucon said to exclude

reputation let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just and do you

still prove to us the superiority of justice




the thesis which for the sake of argument has been maintained by glaucon is

the converse of that of thrasymachusnot right is the interest of the

stronger but right is the necessity of the weaker starting from the same

premises he carries the analysis of society a step further backmight is

still right but the might is the weakness of the many combined against the

strength of the few




there have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which have a

family likeness to the speculations of glaucon eg that power is the

foundation of right or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well or

ill or that virtue is selflove or the love of power or that war is the

natural state of man or that private vices are public benefits all such

theories have a kind of plausibility from their partial agreement with

experience for human nature oscillates between good and evil and the motives

of actions and the origin of institutions may be explained to a certain extent

on either hypothesis according to the character or point of view of a

particular thinker the obligation of maintaining authority under all

circumstances and sometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and

has become a sort of instinct among civilized men the divine right of kings

or more generally of governments is one of the forms under which this natural

feeling is expressed nor again is there any evil which has not some

accompaniment of good or pleasure nor any good which is free from some alloy

of evil nor any noble or generous thought which may not be attended by a

shadow or the ghost of a shadow of selfinterest or of selflove we know that

all human actions are imperfect but we do not therefore attribute them to the

worse rather than to the better motive or principle such a philosophy is both

foolish and false like that opinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other

men to be like himself and theories of this sort do not represent the real

nature of the state which is based on a vague sense of right gradually

corrected and enlarged by custom and law although capable also of perversion

any more than they describe the origin of society which is to be sought in the

family and in the social and religious feelings of man nor do they represent

the average character of individuals which cannot be explained simply on a

theory of evil but has always a counteracting element of good and as men

become better such theories appear more and more untruthful to them because

they are more conscious of their own disinterestedness a little experience may

make a man a cynic a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier

view of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men




the two brothers ask socrates to prove to them that the just is happy when they

have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily supposed to

consist not that there is  any absurdity in the attempt to frame a notion

of justice apart from circumstances for the ideal must always be a paradox

when compared with the ordinary conditions of human life neither the stoical

ideal nor the christian ideal is true as a fact but they may serve as a basis

of education and may exercise an ennobling influence an ideal is none the

worse because some one has made the discovery that no such ideal

was ever realized and in a few exceptional individuals who are raised above

the ordinary level of humanity the ideal of happiness may be realized in death

and misery this may be the state which the reason deliberately approves and

which the utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain

cases to prefer




nor again  must we forget that plato though he agrees generally with the

view implied in the argument of the two brothers is not expressing his own

final conclusion but rather seeking to dramatize one of the aspects of ethical

truth he is developing his idea gradually in a series of positions or

situations he is exhibiting socrates for the first time undergoing the

socratic interrogation lastly  the word happiness involves

some degree of confusion because associated in the language of modern

philosophy with conscious pleasure or satisfaction which was not equally

present to his mind




glaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the happiness

of the unjust to which the misery of the tyrant in book ix is the answer and

parallel and still the unjust must appear just that is the homage

which vice pays to virtue but now adeimantus taking up the hint which

had been already given by glaucon proceeds to show that in the opinion of

mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of rewards and reputation and

points out the advantage which is given to such arguments as those of

thrasymachus and glaucon by the conventional morality of mankind he seems to

feel the difficulty of justifying the ways of god to man both

the brothers touch upon the question whether the morality of actions is

determined by their consequences and both of them go beyond the position of

socrates that justice belongs to the class of goods not desirable for

themselves only but desirable for themselves and for their results to which

he recalls them in their attempt to view justice as an internal principle and

in their condemnation of the poets they anticipate him the common life of

greece is not enough for them they must penetrate deeper into the nature of

things




it has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of glaucon and

adeimantus but is taken by socrates to mean all virtue may we not more truly

say that the oldfashioned notion of justice is enlarged by socrates and

becomes equivalent to universal order or wellbeing first in the state and

secondly in the individual he has found a new answer to his old question

protag whether the virtues are one or many viz that one is

the ordering principle of the three others in seeking to establish the purely

internal nature of justice he is met by the fact that man is a social being

and he tries to harmonise the two opposite theses as well as he can there is

no more inconsistency in this than was inevitable in his age and country there

is no use in turning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy which

from some other point of view would appear equally inconsistent plato does

not give the final solution of philosophical questions for us nor can he be

judged of by our standard




the remainder of the republic is developed out of the question of the sons of

ariston three points are deserving of remark in what immediately

followsfirst that the answer of socrates is altogether indirect he

does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation of the idea of

justice and still less will he be tempted to affirm the stoical paradox that

the just man can be happy on the rack but first he dwells on the difficulty of

the problem and insists on restoring man to his natural condition before he

will answer the question at all he too will frame an ideal but his ideal

comprehends not only abstract justice but the whole relations of man under

the fanciful illustration of the large letters he implies that he will only

look for justice in society and that from the state he will proceed to the

individual his answer in substance amounts to thisthat under

favourable conditions ie in the perfect state justice and happiness will

coincide and that when justice has been once found happiness may be left to

take care of itself that he falls into some degree of inconsistency when in

the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the rewards and honours of justice

may be admitted for he has left those which exist in the perfect state and

the philosopher who retires under the shelter of a wall can

hardly have been esteemed happy by him at least not in this world still he

maintains the true attitude of moral action let a man do his duty first

without asking whether he will be happy or not and happiness will be the

inseparable accident which attends him seek ye first the kingdom of god

and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you




secondly it may be remarked that plato preserves the genuine character of

greek thought in beginning with the state and in going on to the individual

first ethics then politicsthis is the order of ideas to us the reverse

is the order of history only after many struggles of thought does the

individual assert his right as a moral being in early ages he is not one but

one of many the citizen of a state which is prior to him and he has no notion

of good or evil apart from the law of his country or the creed of his church

and to this type he is constantly tending to revert whenever the influence of

custom or of party spirit or the recollection of the past becomes too strong

for him




thirdly we may observe the confusion or identification of the individual and

the state of ethics and politics which pervades early greek speculation and

even in modern times retains a certain degree of influence the subtle

difference between the collective and individual action of mankind seems to

have escaped early thinkers and we too are sometimes in danger of forgetting

the conditions of united human action whenever we either elevate politics into

ethics or lower ethics to the standard of politics the good man and the good

citizen only coincide in the perfect state and this perfection cannot be

attained by legislation acting upon them from without but if at all by

education fashioning them from within




socrates praises the sons of ariston inspired offspring of the

renowned hero as the elegiac poet terms them but he does not

understand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice while their

character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own arguments he knows not

how to answer them although he is afraid of deserting justice in the hour of

need he therefore makes a condition that having weak eyes he shall be allowed

to read the large letters first and then go on to the smaller that is he must

look for justice in the state first and will then proceed to the individual

accordingly he begins to construct the state




society arises out of the wants of man his first want is food his second a

house his third a coat the sense of these needs and the possibility of

satisfying them by exchange draw individuals together on the same spot and

this is the beginning of a state which we take the liberty to invent although

necessity is the real inventor there must be first a husbandman secondly a

builder thirdly a weaver to which may be added a cobbler four or five

citizens at least are required to make a city now men have different natures

and one man will do one thing better than many and business waits for no man

hence there must be a division of labour into different employments into

wholesale and retail trade into workers and makers of workmens tools

into shepherds and husbandmen a city which includes all this will have far

exceeded the limit of four or five and yet not be very large but then again

imports will be required and imports necessitate exports and this implies

variety of produce in order to attract the taste of purchasers also merchants

and ships in the city too we must have a market and money and retail trades

otherwise buyers and sellers will never meet and the valuable time of the

producers will be wasted in vain efforts at exchange if we add hired servants

the state will be complete and we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse

of the citizens with one another justice and injustice will appear




here follows a rustic picture of their way of life they spend their days in

houses which they have built for themselves they make their own clothes and

produce their own corn and wine their principal food is meal and flour and

they drink in moderation they live on the best of terms with each other and

take care not to have too many children but said glaucon

interposing are they not to have a relish certainly they will

have salt and olives and cheese vegetables and fruits and chestnuts to roast

at the fire tis a city of pigs socrates why i replied

what do you want more only the comforts of lifesofas and

tables also sauces and sweets i see you want not only a state but a

luxurious state and possibly in the more complex frame we may sooner find

justice and injustice then the fine arts must go to workevery

conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be wanted there will be

dancers painters sculptors musicians cooks barbers tirewomen nurses

artists swineherds and neatherds too for the animals and physicians to cure

the disorders of which luxury is the source to feed all these superfluous

mouths we shall need a part of our neighbours land and they will want a

part of ours and this is the origin of war which may be traced to the same

causes as other political evils our city will now require the slight addition

of a camp and the citizen will be converted into a soldier but then again our

old doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten the art of war

cannot be learned in a day and there must be a natural aptitude for military

duties there will be some warlike natures who have this aptitudedogs

keen of scent swift of foot to pursue and strong of limb to fight and as

spirit is the foundation of courage such natures whether of men or animals

will be full of spirit but these spirited natures are apt to bite and devour

one another the union of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies

appears to be an impossibility and the guardian of a state requires both

qualities who then can be a guardian the image of the dog suggests an answer

for dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers your dog is a

philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing and philosophy

whether in man or beast is the parent of gentleness the human watchdogs must

be philosophers or lovers of learning which will make them gentle and how are

they to be learned without education




but what shall their education be is any better than the oldfashioned sort

which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic music includes

literature and literature is of two kinds true and false what do you

mean he said i mean that children hear stories before they learn

gymnastics and that the stories are either untrue or have at most one or two

grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood now early life is very impressible

and children ought not to learn what they will have to unlearn when they grow

up we must therefore have a censorship of nursery tales banishing some and

keeping others some of them are very improper as we may see in the great

instances of homer and hesiod who not only tell lies but bad lies stories

about uranus and saturn which are immoral as well as false and which should

never be spoken of to young persons or indeed at all or if at all then in a

mystery after the sacrifice not of an eleusinian pig but of some

unprocurable animal shall our youth be encouraged to beat their fathers by the

example of zeus or our citizens be incited to quarrel by hearing or seeing

representations of strife among the gods shall they listen to the narrative of

hephaestus binding his mother and of zeus sending him flying for helping her

when she was beaten such tales may possibly have a mystical interpretation

but the young are incapable of understanding allegory if any one asks what

tales are to be allowed we will answer that we are legislators and not

bookmakers we only lay down the principles according to which books are to be

written to write them is the duty of others




and our first principle is that god must be represented as he is not as the

author of all things but of good only we will not suffer the poets to say

that he is the steward of good and evil or that he has two casks full of

destiniesor that athene and zeus incited pandarus to break the treaty

or that god caused the sufferings of niobe or of pelops or the trojan war or

that he makes men sin when he wishes to destroy them either these were not the

actions of the gods or god was just and men were the better for being

punished but that the deed was evil and god the author is a wicked suicidal

fiction which we will allow no one old or young to utter this is our first

and great principlegod is the author of good only




and the second principle is like unto itwith god is no variableness or

change of form reason teaches us this for if we suppose a change in god he

must be changed either by another or by himself by anotherbut the best

works of nature and art and the noblest qualities of mind are least liable to

be changed by any external force by himselfbut he cannot change for

the better he will hardly change for the worse he remains for ever fairest

and best in his own image therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell

us of here begging in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl

about at night in strange disguises all that blasphemous nonsense with which

mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed but some one

will say that god who is himself unchangeable may take a form in relation to

us why should he for gods as well as men hate the lie in the soul or

principle of falsehood and as for any other form of lying which is used for a

purpose and is regarded as innocent in certain exceptional caseswhat

need have the gods of this for they are not ignorant of antiquity like the

poets nor are they afraid of their enemies nor is any madman a friend of

theirs god then is true he is absolutely true he changes not he deceives

not by day or night by word or sign this is our second great

principlegod is true away with the lying dream of agamemnon in homer

and the accusation of thetis against apollo in aeschylus




in order to give clearness to his conception of the state plato proceeds to

trace the first principles of mutual need and of division of labour in an

imaginary community of four or five citizens gradually this community

increases the division of labour extends to countries imports necessitate

exports a medium of exchange is required and retailers sit in the

marketplace to save the time of the producers these are the steps by which

plato constructs the first or primitive state introducing the elements of

political economy by the way as he is going to frame a second or civilized

state the simple naturally comes before the complex he indulges like

rousseau in a picture of primitive lifean idea which has indeed often

had a powerful influence on the imagination of mankind but he does not

seriously mean to say that one is better than the other politicus nor can

any inference be drawn from the description of the first state taken apart from

the second such as aristotle appears to draw in the politics we should not

interpret a platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in too literal

or matteroffact a style on the other hand when we compare the lively fancy

of plato with the driedup abstractions of modern treatises on philosophy we

are compelled to say with protagoras that the mythus is more

interesting protag




several interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in a

treatise on political economy are scattered up and down the writings of plato

especially laws population free trade adulteration wills and bequests

begging eryxias though not platos value and demand republic

division of labour the last subject and also the origin of retail trade is

treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of the republic but plato

never combined his economic ideas into a system and never seems to have

recognized that trade is one of the great motive powers of the state and of the

world he would make retail traders only of the inferior sort of citizens

rep laws though he remarks quaintly enough laws that if only

the best men and the best women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a

time or to carry on retail trade etc then we should knew how pleasant and

agreeable all these things are




the disappointment of glaucon at the city of pigs the ludicrous

description of the ministers of luxury in the more refined state and the

afterthought of the necessity of doctors the illustration of the nature of the

guardian taken from the dog the desirableness of offering some almost

unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to be celebrated the behaviour

of zeus to his father and of hephaestus to his mother are touches of humour

which have also a serious meaning in speaking of education plato rather

startles us by affirming that a child must be trained in falsehood first and in

truth afterwards yet this is not very different from saying that children must

be taught through the medium of imagination as well as reason that their minds

can only develope gradually and that there is much which they must learn

without understanding this is also the substance of platos view though

he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat differently from modern

ethical writers respecting truth and falsehood to us economies or

accommodations would not be allowable unless they were required by the human

faculties or necessary for the communication of knowledge to the simple and

ignorant we should insist that the word was inseparable from the intention

and that we must not be falsely true ie speak or act falsely

in support of what was right or true but plato would limit the use of fictions

only by requiring that they should have a good moral effect and that such a

dangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed by the rulers alone and for

great objects




a greek in the age of plato attached no importance to the question whether his

religion was an historical fact he was just beginning to be conscious that the

past had a history but he could see nothing beyond homer and hesiod whether

their narratives were true or false did not seriously affect the political or

social life of hellas men only began to suspect that they were fictions when

they recognised them to be immoral and so in all religions the consideration

of their morality comes first afterwards the truth of the documents in which

they are recorded or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of

them but in modern times and in protestant countries perhaps more than in

catholic we have been too much inclined to identify the historical with the

moral and some have refused to believe in religion at all unless a superhuman

accuracy was discernible in every part of the record the facts of an ancient

or religious history are amongst the most important of all facts but they are

frequently uncertain and we only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered

from them when we place ourselves above them these reflections tend to show

that the difference between plato and ourselves though not unimportant is not

so great as might at first sight appear for we should agree with him in

placing the moral before the historical truth of religion and generally in

disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which necessarily occur in

the early stages of all religions we know also that changes in the traditions

of a country cannot be made in a day and are therefore tolerant of many things

which science and criticism would condemn




we note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology said to

have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before christ by

theagenes of rhegium was well established in the age of plato and here as in

the phaedrus though for a different reason was rejected by him that

anachronisms whether of religion or law when men have reached another stage of

civilization should be got rid of by fictions is in accordance with universal

experience great is the art of interpretation and by a natural process which

when once discovered was always going on what could not be altered was

explained away and so without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by

side two forms of religion the tradition inherited or invented by the poets

and the customary worship of the temple on the other hand there was the

religion of the philosopher who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas but did

not therefore refuse to offer a cock to aesculapius or to be seen saying his

prayers at the rising of the sun at length the antagonism between the popular

and philosophical religion never so great among the greeks as in our own age

disappeared and was only felt like the difference between the religion of the

educated and uneducated among ourselves the zeus of homer and hesiod easily

passed into the royal mind of plato philebus the giant

heracles became the knighterrant and benefactor of mankind these and still

more wonderful transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of stoics

and neoplatonists in the two or three centuries before and after christ the

greek and roman religions were gradually permeated by the spirit of philosophy

having lost their ancient meaning they were resolved into poetry and morality

and probably were never purer than at the time of their decay when their

influence over the world was waning




a singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the lie in

the soul this is connected with the platonic and socratic doctrine that

involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary the lie in the soul is a true

lie the corruption of the highest truth the deception of the highest part of

the soul from which he who is deceived has no power of delivering himself for

example to represent god as false or immoral or according to plato as

deluding men with appearances or as the author of evil or again to affirm

with protagoras that knowledge is sensation or that being

is becoming or with thrasymachus that might is right

would have been regarded by plato as a lie of this hateful sort the greatest

unconsciousness of the greatest untruth eg if in the language of the

gospels john he who was blind were to say i see

is another aspect of the state of mind which plato is describing the lie in

the soul may be further compared with the sin against the holy ghost luke

allowing for the difference between greek and christian modes of speaking to

this is opposed the lie in words which is only such a deception as may occur

in a play or poem or allegory or figure of speech or in any sort of

accommodationwhich though useless to the gods may be useful to men in

certain cases socrates is here answering the question which he had himself

raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman and he is also contrasting

the nature of god and man for god is truth but mankind can only be true by

appearing sometimes to be partial or false reserving for another place the

greater questions of religion or education we may note further  the

approval of the old traditional education of greece  the preparation which

plato is making for the attack on homer and the poets  the preparation

which he is also making for the use of economies in the state  the

contemptuous and at the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he

alludes to the chronique scandaleuse of the gods




book iii there is another motive in purifying religion which is to banish

fear for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death or who believes the

tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below they must be

gently requested not to abuse hell they may be reminded that their stories are

both untrue and discouraging nor must they be angry if we expunge obnoxious

passages such as the depressing words of achillesi would rather

be a servingman than rule over all the dead and the verses which tell

of the squalid mansions the senseless shadows the flitting soul mourning over

lost strength and youth the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like

smoke or the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats the terrors

and horrors of cocytus and styx ghosts and sapless shades and the rest of

their tartarean nomenclature must vanish such tales may have their use but

they are not the proper food for soldiers as little can we admit the sorrows

and sympathies of the homeric heroesachilles the son of thetis in

tears throwing ashes on his head or pacing up and down the seashore in

distraction or priam the cousin of the gods crying aloud rolling in the

mire a good man is not prostrated at the loss of children or fortune neither

is death terrible to him and therefore lamentations over the dead should not

be practised by men of note they should be the concern of inferior persons

only whether women or men still worse is the attribution of such weakness to

the gods as when the goddesses say alas my travail and worst

of all when the king of heaven himself laments his inability to save hector

or sorrows over the impending doom of his dear sarpedon such a character of

god if not ridiculed by our young men is likely to be imitated by them nor

should our citizens be given to excess of laughtersuch violent

delights are followed by a violent reaction the description in the

iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the clumsiness of hephaestus will not

be admitted by us certainly not




truth should have a high place among the virtues for falsehood as we were

saying is useless to the gods and only useful to men as a medicine but this

employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of state the common man must

not in return tell a lie to the ruler any more than the patient would tell a

lie to his physician or the sailor to his captain




in the next place our youth must be temperate and temperance consists in

selfcontrol and obedience to authority that is a lesson which homer teaches

in some places the achaeans marched on breathing prowess in silent awe

of their leadersbut a very different one in other places

o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog but the heart of a

stag language of the latter kind will not impress selfcontrol on the

minds of youth the same may be said about his praises of eating and drinking

and his dread of starvation also about the verses in which he tells of the

rapturous loves of zeus and here or of how hephaestus once detained ares and

aphrodite in a net on a similar occasion there is a nobler strain heard in the

wordsendure my soul thou hast endured worse nor must

we allow our citizens to receive bribes or to say gifts persuade the

gods gifts reverend kings or to applaud the ignoble advice of phoenix

to achilles that he should get money out of the greeks before he assisted them

or the meanness of achilles himself in taking gifts from agamemnon or his

requiring a ransom for the body of hector or his cursing of apollo or his

insolence to the rivergod scamander or his dedication to the dead patroclus

of his own hair which had been already dedicated to the other rivergod

spercheius or his cruelty in dragging the body of hector round the walls and

slaying the captives at the pyre such a combination of meanness and cruelty in

cheirons pupil is inconceivable the amatory exploits of peirithous and

theseus are equally unworthy either these socalled sons of gods were not the

sons of gods or they were not such as the poets imagine them any more than

the gods themselves are the authors of evil the youth who believes that such

things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing in their veins

will be too ready to imitate their example




enough of gods and heroeswhat shall we say about men what the poets

and storytellers saythat the wicked prosper and the righteous are

afflicted or that justice is anothers gain such misrepresentations

cannot be allowed by us but in this we are anticipating the definition of

justice and had therefore better defer the enquiry




the subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated next follows style now

all poetry is a narrative of events past present or to come and narrative is

of three kinds the simple the imitative and a composition of the two an

instance will make my meaning clear the first scene in homer is of the last or

mixed kind being partly description and partly dialogue but if you throw the

dialogue into the oratio obliqua the passage will run thus the

priest came and prayed apollo that the achaeans might take troy and have a safe

return if agamemnon would only give him back his daughter and the other greeks

assented but agamemnon was wroth and so onthe whole then becomes

descriptive and the poet is the only speaker left or if you omit the

narrative the whole becomes dialogue these are the three styleswhich

of them is to be admitted into our state do you ask whether tragedy and

comedy are to be admitted yes but also something moreis it not

doubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all or rather has not

the question been already answered for we have decided that one man cannot in

his life play many parts any more than he can act both tragedy and comedy or

be rhapsodist and actor at once human nature is coined into very small pieces

and as our guardians have their own business already which is the care of

freedom they will have enough to do without imitating if they imitate they

should imitate not any meanness or baseness but the good only for the mask

which the actor wears is apt to become his face we cannot allow men to play

the parts of women quarrelling weeping scolding or boasting against the

godsleast of all when making love or in labour they must not represent

slaves or bullies or cowards drunkards or madmen or blacksmiths or

neighing horses or bellowing bulls or sounding rivers or a raging sea a

good or wise man will be willing to perform good and wise actions but he will

be ashamed to play an inferior part which he has never practised and he will

prefer to employ the descriptive style with as little imitation as possible

the man who has no selfrespect on the contrary will imitate anybody and

anything sounds of nature and cries of animals alike his whole performance

will be imitation of gesture and voice now in the descriptive style there are

few changes but in the dramatic there are a great many poets and musicians

use either or a compound of both and this compound is very attractive to

youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar but our state in which one

man plays one part only is not adapted for complexity and when one of these

polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers to exhibit himself and his poetry we

will show him every observance of respect but at the same time tell him that

there is no room for his kind in our state we prefer the rough honest poet

and will not depart from our original models laws




next as to the music a song or ode has three partsthe subject the

harmony and the rhythm of which the two last are dependent upon the first as

we banished strains of lamentation so we may now banish the mixed lydian

harmonies which are the harmonies of lamentation and as our citizens are to

be temperate we may also banish convivial harmonies such as the ionian and

pure lydian two remainthe dorian and phrygian the first for war the

second for peace the one expressive of courage the other of obedience or

instruction or religious feeling and as we reject varieties of harmony we

shall also reject the manystringed variouslyshaped instruments which give

utterance to them and in particular the flute which is more complex than any

of them the lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town and the

panspipe in the fields thus we have made a purgation of music and

will now make a purgation of metres these should be like the harmonies simple

and suitable to the occasion there are four notes of the tetrachord and there

are three ratios of metre    which have all their characteristics

and the feet have different characteristics as well as the rhythms but about

this you and i must ask damon the great musician who speaks if i remember

rightly of a martial measure as well as of dactylic trochaic and iambic

rhythms which he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another

assigning to each the proper quantity we only venture to affirm the general

principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the

style and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul should be reflected in

them all this principle of simplicity has to be learnt by every one in the

days of his youth and may be gathered anywhere from the creative and

constructive arts as well as from the forms of plants and animals




other artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or

unseemliness sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to the law

of simplicity he who violates it cannot be allowed to work in our city and to

corrupt the taste of our citizens for our guardians must grow up not amid

images of deformity which will gradually poison and corrupt their souls but in

a land of health and beauty where they will drink in from every object sweet

and harmonious influences and of all these influences the greatest is the

education given by music which finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts

to it the sense of beauty and of deformity at first the effect is unconscious

but when reason arrives then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as the

friend whom he always knew as in learning to read first we acquire the

elements or letters separately and afterwards their combinations and cannot

recognize reflections of them until we know the letters themselvesin

like manner we must first attain the elements or essential forms of the

virtues and then trace their combinations in life and experience there is a

music of the soul which answers to the harmony of the world and the fairest

object of a musical soul is the fair mind in the fair body some defect in the

latter may be excused but not in the former true love is the daughter of

temperance and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of bodily

pleasure enough has been said of music which makes a fair ending with love




next we pass on to gymnastics about which i would remark that the soul is

related to the body as a cause to an effect and therefore if we educate the

mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge and need only give a

general outline of the course to be pursued in the first place the guardians

must abstain from strong drink for they should be the last persons to lose

their wits whether the habits of the palaestra are suitable to them is more

doubtful for the ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing and if left off

suddenly is apt to endanger health but our warrior athletes must be wideawake

dogs and must also be inured to all changes of food and climate hence they

will require a simpler kind of gymnastic akin to their simple music and for

their diet a rule may be found in homer who feeds his heroes on roast meat

only and gives them no fish although they are living at the seaside nor

boiled meats which involve an apparatus of pots and pans and if i am not

mistaken he nowhere mentions sweet sauces sicilian cookery and attic

confections and corinthian courtezans which are to gymnastic what lydian and

ionian melodies are to music must be forbidden where gluttony and

intemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders and law

and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a state take an

interest in them but what can show a more disgraceful state of education than

to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home and

yet there is a worse stage of the same diseasewhen men have learned to

take a pleasure and pride in the twists and turns of the law not considering

how much better it would be for them so to order their lives as to have no need

of a nodding justice and there is a like disgrace in employing a physician

not for the cure of wounds or epidemic disorders but because a man has by

laziness and luxury contracted diseases which were unknown in the days of

asclepius how simple is the homeric practice of medicine eurypylus after he

has been wounded drinks a posset of pramnian wine which is of a heating

nature and yet the sons of asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him

the drink nor patroclus who is attending on him the truth is that this modern

system of nursing diseases was introduced by herodicus the trainer who being

of a sickly constitution by a compound of training and medicine tortured first

himself and then a good many other people and lived a great deal longer than

he had any right but asclepius would not practise this art because he knew

that the citizens of a wellordered state have no leisure to be ill and

therefore he adopted the kill or cure method which artisans and

labourers employ they must be at their business they say

and have no time for coddling if they recover well if they

dont there is an end of them whereas the rich man is supposed

to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill do you know a maxim of

phocylidesthat when a man begins to be rich or perhaps

a little sooner he should practise virtue but how can excessive

care of health be inconsistent with an ordinary occupation and yet consistent

with that practice of virtue which phocylides inculcates when a student

imagines that philosophy gives him a headache he never does anything he is

always unwell this was the reason why asclepius and his sons practised no such

art they were acting in the interest of the public and did not wish to

preserve useless lives or raise up a puny offspring to wretched sires honest

diseases they honestly cured and if a man was wounded they applied the proper

remedies and then let him eat and drink what he liked but they declined to

treat intemperate and worthless subjects even though they might have made

large fortunes out of them as to the story of pindar that asclepius was slain

by a thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life that is a

liefollowing our old rule we must say either that he did not take

bribes or that he was not the son of a god




glaucon then asks socrates whether the best physicians and the best judges will

not be those who have had severally the greatest experience of diseases and of

crimes socrates draws a distinction between the two professions the physician

should have had experience of disease in his own body for he cures with his

mind and not with his body but the judge controls mind by mind and therefore

his mind should not be corrupted by crime where then is he to gain experience

how is he to be wise and also innocent when young a good man is apt to be

deceived by evildoers because he has no pattern of evil in himself and

therefore the judge should be of a certain age his youth should have been

innocent and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the practice of

it but by the observation of it in others this is the ideal of a judge the

criminal turned detective is wonderfully suspicious but when in company with

good men who have experience he is at fault for he foolishly imagines that

every one is as bad as himself vice may be known of virtue but cannot know

virtue this is the sort of medicine and this the sort of law which will

prevail in our state they will be healing arts to better natures but the evil

body will be left to die by the one and the evil soul will be put to death by

the other and the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music

which will give harmony to the soul and good gymnastic which will give health

to the body not that this division of music and gymnastic really corresponds

to soul and body for they are both equally concerned with the soul which is

tamed by the one and aroused and sustained by the other the two together

supply our guardians with their twofold nature the passionate disposition when

it has too much gymnastic is hardened and brutalized the gentle or philosophic

temper which has too much music becomes enervated while a man is allowing

music to pour like water through the funnel of his ears the edge of his soul

gradually wears away and the passionate or spirited element is melted out of

him too little spirit is easily exhausted too much quickly passes into

nervous irritability so again the athlete by feeding and training has his

courage doubled but he soon grows stupid he is like a wild beast ready to do

everything by blows and nothing by counsel or policy there are two principles

in man reason and passion and to these not to the soul and body the two

arts of music and gymnastic correspond he who mingles them in harmonious

concord is the true musicianhe shall be the presiding genius of our

state




the next question is who are to be our rulers first the elder must rule the

younger and the best of the elders will be the best guardians now they will

be the best who love their subjects most and think that they have a common

interest with them in the welfare of the state these we must select but they

must be watched at every epoch of life to see whether they have retained the

same opinions and held out against force and enchantment for time and

persuasion and the love of pleasure may enchant a man into a change of purpose

and the force of grief and pain may compel him and therefore our guardians

must be men who have been tried by many tests like gold in the refiners

fire and have been passed first through danger then through pleasure and at

every age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain in full

command of themselves and their principles having all their faculties in

harmonious exercise for their countrys good these shall receive the

highest honours both in life and death it would perhaps be better to confine

the term guardians to this select class the younger men may be

called auxiliaries




and now for one magnificent lie in the belief of which oh that we could train

our rulersat any rate let us make the attempt with the rest of the

world what i am going to tell is only another version of the legend of cadmus

but our unbelieving generation will be slow to accept such a story the tale

must be imparted first to the rulers then to the soldiers lastly to the

people we will inform them that their youth was a dream and that during the

time when they seemed to be undergoing their education they were really being

fashioned in the earth who sent them up when they were ready and that they

must protect and cherish her whose children they are and regard each other as

brothers and sisters i do not wonder at your being ashamed to propound

such a fiction there is more behind these brothers and sisters have

different natures and some of them god framed to rule whom he fashioned of

gold others he made of silver to be auxiliaries others again to be

husbandmen and craftsmen and these were formed by him of brass and iron but

as they are all sprung from a common stock a golden parent may have a silver

son or a silver parent a golden son and then there must be a change of rank

the son of the rich must descend and the child of the artisan rise in the

social scale for an oracle says that the state will come to an end if

governed by a man of brass or iron will our citizens ever believe all

this not in the present generation but in the next perhaps

yes




now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers and look

about and pitch their camp in a high place which will be safe against enemies

from without and likewise against insurrections from within there let them

sacrifice and set up their tents for soldiers they are to be and not

shopkeepers the watchdogs and guardians of the sheep and luxury and avarice

will turn them into wolves and tyrants their habits and their dwellings should

correspond to their education they should have no property their pay should

only meet their expenses and they should have common meals gold and silver we

will tell them that they have from god and this divine gift in their souls

they must not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name of

gold they only of the citizens may not touch it or be under the same roof

with it or drink from it it is the accursed thing should they ever acquire

houses or lands or money of their own they will become householders and

tradesmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of helpers and the

hour of ruin both to themselves and the rest of the state will be at hand




the religious and ethical aspect of platos education will hereafter be

considered under a separate head some lesser points may be more conveniently

noticed in this place




 the constant appeal to the authority of homer whom with grave irony

plato after the manner of his age summons as a witness about ethics and

psychology as well as about diet and medicine attempting to distinguish the

better lesson from the worse sometimes altering the text from design more

than once quoting or alluding to homer inaccurately after the manner of the

early logographers turning the iliad into prose and delighting to draw

farfetched inferences from his words or to make ludicrous applications of

them he does not like heracleitus get into a rage with homer and archilochus

heracl but uses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth

not on a system like theagenes of rhegium or metrodorus or in later times the

stoics but as fancy may dictate and the conclusions drawn from them are

sound although the premises are fictitious these fanciful appeals to homer

add a charm to platos style and at the same time they have the effect

of a satire on the follies of homeric interpretation to us and probably to

himself although they take the form of arguments they are really figures of

speech they may be compared with modern citations from scripture which have

often a great rhetorical power even when the original meaning of the words is

entirely lost sight of the real like the platonic socrates as we gather from

the memorabilia of xenophon was fond of making similar adaptations great in

all ages and countries in religion as well as in law and literature has been

the art of interpretation




 the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the

style notwithstanding the fascination which the word

classical exercises over us we can hardly maintain that this

rule is observed in all the greek poetry which has come down to us we cannot

deny that the thought often exceeds the power of lucid expression in aeschylus

and pindar or that rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the sophistpoet

euripides only perhaps in sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the two in

him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a greek statue in

which there is nothing to add or to take away at least this is true of single

plays or of large portions of them the connection in the tragic choruses and

in the greek lyric poets is not unfrequently a tangled thread which in an age

before logic the poet was unable to draw out many thoughts and feelings

mingled in his mind and he had no power of disengaging or arranging them for

there is a subtle influence of logic which requires to be transferred from

prose to poetry just as the music and perfection of language are infused by

poetry into prose in all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his own meaning

apol for he does not see that the word which is full of associations to his

own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of another or that the sequence

which is clear to himself is puzzling to others there are many passages in

some of our greatest modern poets which are far too obscure in which there is

no proportion between style and subject in which any halfexpressed figure

any harsh construction any distorted collocation of words any remote sequence

of ideas is admitted and there is no voice coming sweetly from

nature or music adding the expression of feeling to thought as if

there could be poetry without beauty or beauty without ease and clearness the

obscurities of early greek poets arose necessarily out of the state of language

and logic which existed in their age they are not examples to be followed by

us for the use of language ought in every generation to become clearer and

clearer like shakespere they were great in spite not in consequence of

their imperfections of expression but there is no reason for returning to the

necessary obscurity which prevailed in the infancy of literature the english

poets of the last century were certainly not obscure and we have no excuse for

losing what they had gained or for going back to the earlier or transitional

age which preceded them the thought of our own times has not outstripped

language a want of platos art of measuring is the rule

cause of the disproportion between them




 in the third book of the republic a nearer approach is made to a theory of

art than anywhere else in plato his views may be summed up as

followstrue art is not fanciful and imitative but simple and

idealthe expression of the highest moral energy whether in action or

repose to live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and simple

character or to listen to such strains is the best of influencesthe

true greek atmosphere in which youth should be brought up that is the way to

create in them a natural good taste which will have a feeling of truth and

beauty in all things for though the poets are to be expelled still art is

recognized as another aspect of reasonlike love in the symposium

extending over the same sphere but confined to the preliminary education and

acting through the power of habit and this conception of art is not limited to

strains of music or the forms of plastic art but pervades all nature and has a

wide kindred in the world the republic of plato like the athens of pericles

has an artistic as well as a political side




there is hardly any mention in plato of the creative arts only in two or three

passages does he even allude to them rep soph he is not lost in rapture

at the great works of phidias the parthenon the propylea the statues of zeus

or athene he would probably have regarded any abstract truth of number or

figure as higher than the greatest of them yet it is hard to suppose that some

influence such as he hopes to inspire in youth did not pass into his own mind

from the works of art which he saw around him we are living upon the fragments

of them and find in a few broken stones the standard of truth and beauty but

in plato this feeling has no expression he nowhere says that beauty is the

object of art he seems to deny that wisdom can take an external form

phaedrus he does not distinguish the fine from the mechanical arts whether

or no like some writers he felt more than he expressed it is at any rate

remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with

an almost entire silence about them in one very striking passage he tells us

that a work of art like the state is a whole and this conception of a whole

and the love of the newlyborn mathematical sciences may be regarded if not as

the inspiring at any rate as the regulating principles of greek art xen

mem and sophist




 plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better not be

in robust health and should have known what illness is in his own person but

the judge ought to have had no similar experience of evil he is to be a good

man who having passed his youth in innocence became acquainted late in life

with the vices of others and therefore according to plato a judge should not

be young just as a young man according to aristotle is not fit to be a hearer

of moral philosophy the bad on the other hand have a knowledge of vice but

no knowledge of virtue it may be doubted however whether this train of

reflection is well founded in a remarkable passage of the laws it is

acknowledged that the evil may form a correct estimate of the good the union

of gentleness and courage in book ii at first seemed to be a paradox yet was

afterwards ascertained to be a truth and plato might also have found that the

intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence of it there is a

directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight into vice and the knowledge

of character is in some degree a natural sense independent of any special

experience of good or evil




 one of the most remarkable conceptions of plato because ungreek and also

very different from anything which existed at all in his age of the world is

the transposition of ranks in the spartan state there had been enfranchisement

of helots and degradation of citizens under special circumstances and in the

ancient greek aristocracies merit was certainly recognized as one of the

elements on which government was based the founders of states were supposed to

be their benefactors who were raised by their great actions above the ordinary

level of humanity at a later period the services of warriors and legislators

were held to entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of

citizenship and to the first rank in the state and although the existence of

an ideal aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains of early greek

history and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a character however the

idea may be defined to any actual hellenic stateor indeed to any state

which has ever existed in the worldstill the rule of the best was

certainly the aspiration of philosophers who probably accommodated a good deal

their views of primitive history to their own notions of good government plato

further insists on applying to the guardians of his state a series of tests by

which all those who fell short of a fixed standard were either removed from the

governing body or not admitted to it and this academic

discipline did to a certain extent prevail in greek states especially in

sparta he also indicates that the system of caste which existed in a great

part of the ancient and is by no means extinct in the modern european world

should be set aside from time to time in favour of merit he is aware how

deeply the greater part of mankind resent any interference with the order of

society and therefore he proposes his novel idea in the form of what he

himself calls a monstrous fiction compare the ceremony of

preparation for the two great waves in book v two principles

are indicated by him first that there is a distinction of ranks dependent on

circumstances prior to the individual second that this distinction is and

ought to be broken through by personal qualities he adapts mythology like the

homeric poems to the wants of the state making the phoenician

tale the vehicle of his ideas every greek state had a myth respecting

its own origin the platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men

the gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told and the analogy of

greek tradition are a sufficient verification of the monstrous

falsehood ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and

iron age succeeding one another but plato supposes these differences in the

natures of men to exist together in a single state mythology supplies a figure

under which the lesson may be taught as protagoras says the myth is

more interesting and also enables plato to touch lightly on new

principles without going into details in this passage he shadows forth a

general truth but he does not tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks

is to be effected indeed throughout the republic he allows the lower ranks to

fade into the distance we do not know whether they are to carry arms and

whether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the communistic

regulations respecting property and marriage nor is there any use in arguing

strictly either from a few chance words or from the silence of plato or in

drawing inferences which were beyond his vision aristotle in his criticism on

the position of the lower classes does not perceive that the poetical creation

is like the air invulnerable and cannot be penetrated by the

shafts of his logic pol




 two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest degree

fanciful and ideal and which suggest to him many reflections are to be found

in the third book of the republic first the great power of music so much

beyond any influence which is experienced by us in modern times when the art

or science has been far more developed and has found the secret of harmony as

well as of melody secondly the indefinite and almost absolute control which

the soul is supposed to exercise over the body




in the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration such as we may also

observe among certain masters of the art not unknown to us at the present

day with this natural enthusiasm which is felt by a few only there seems to

mingle in plato a sort of pythagorean reverence for numbers and numerical

proportion to which aristotle is a stranger intervals of sound and number are

to him sacred things which have a law of their own not dependent on the

variations of sense they rise above sense and become a connecting link with

the world of ideas but it is evident that plato is describing what to him

appears to be also a fact the power of a simple and characteristic melody on

the impressible mind of the greek is more than we can easily appreciate the

effect of national airs may bear some comparison with it and besides all

this there is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the harmony

of soul and body which is so potently inspired by them




the second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting questionshow

far can the mind control the body is the relation between them one of mutual

antagonism or of mutual harmony are they two or one and is either of them the

cause of the other may we not at times drop the opposition between them and

the mode of describing them which is so familiar to us and yet hardly conveys

any precise meaning and try to view this composite creature man in a more

simple manner must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a

higher and a lower principle divided by no distinct line which at times break

asunder and take up arms against one another or again they are reconciled and

move together either unconsciously in the ordinary work of life or

consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim to be attained not without an

effort and for which every thought and nerve are strained and then the body

becomes the good friend or ally or servant or instrument of the mind and the

mind has often a wonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and

weakness and calling out a hidden strength reason and the desires the

intellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as to form a

single human being they are ever parting ever meeting and the identity or

diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most part unnoticed by

us when the mind touches the body through the appetites we acknowledge the

responsibility of the one to the other there is a tendency in us which says

drink there is another which says do not drink it is

not good for you and we all of us know which is the rightful superior

we are also responsible for our health although into this sphere there enter

some elements of necessity which may be beyond our control still even in the

management of health care and thought continued over many years may make us

almost free agents if we do not exact too much of ourselves and if we

acknowledge that all human freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of

mind




we are disappointed to find that plato in the general condemnation which he

passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day depreciates the

effects of diet he would like to have diseases of a definite character and

capable of receiving a definite treatment he is afraid of invalidism

interfering with the business of life he does not recognize that time is the

great healer both of mental and bodily disorders and that remedies which are

gradual and proceed little by little are safer than those which produce a

sudden catastrophe neither does he see that there is no way in which the mind

can more surely influence the body than by the control of eating and drinking

or any other action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of

the will can be more simple or truly asserted




 lesser matters of style may be remarked




 the affected ignorance of music which is platos way of expressing

that he is passing lightly over the subject




 the tentative manner in which here as in the second book he proceeds with

the construction of the state




 the description of the state sometimes as a reality and then again as a

work of imagination only these are the arts by which he sustains the

readers interest




 connecting links or the preparation for the entire expulsion of the poets

in book x




 the companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the valetudinarian

the satirical jest about the maxim of phocylides the manner in which the image

of the gold and silver citizens is taken up into the subject and the argument

from the practice of asclepius should not escape notice




book iv adeimantus said suppose a person to argue socrates that you

make your citizens miserable and this by their own freewill they are the

lords of the city and yet instead of having like other men lands and houses

and money of their own they live as mercenaries and are always mounting

guard you may add i replied that they receive no pay but only their

food and have no money to spend on a journey or a mistress well and

what answer do you give my answer is that our guardians may or may not

be the happiest of meni should not be surprised to find in the longrun

that they werebut this is not the aim of our constitution which was

designed for the good of the whole and not of any one part if i went to a

sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye which is the noblest

feature of the face not purple but black he would reply the eye must

be an eye and you should look at the statue as a whole now i

can well imagine a fools paradise in which everybody is eating and

drinking clothed in purple and fine linen and potters lie on sofas and have

their wheel at hand that they may work a little when they please and cobblers

and all the other classes of a state lose their distinctive character and a

state may get on without cobblers but when the guardians degenerate into boon

companions then the ruin is complete remember that we are not talking of

peasants keeping holiday but of a state in which every man is expected to do

his own work the happiness resides not in this or that class but in the state

as a whole i have another remark to makea middle condition is best for

artisans they should have money enough to buy tools and not enough to be

independent of business and will not the same condition be best for our

citizens if they are poor they will be mean if rich luxurious and lazy and

in neither case contented but then how will our poor city be able to go

to war against an enemy who has money there may be a difficulty in

fighting against one enemy against two there will be none in the first place

the contest will be carried on by trained warriors against welltodo citizens

and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout opponents at least

suppose also that before engaging we send ambassadors to one of the two

cities saying silver and gold we have not do you help us and take our

share of the spoilwho would fight against the lean wiry dogs

when they might join with them in preying upon the fatted sheep but if

many states join their resources shall we not be in danger i am amused

to hear you use the word state of any but our own state they are

states but not a statemany in one for in

every state there are two hostile nations rich and poor which you may set one

against the other but our state while she remains true to her principles

will be in very deed the mightiest of hellenic states




to the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity it must

be neither too large nor too small to be one this is a matter of secondary

importance like the principle of transposition which was intimated in the

parable of the earthborn men the meaning there implied was that every man

should do that for which he was fitted and be at one with himself and then

the whole city would be united but all these things are secondary if

education which is the great matter be duly regarded when the wheel has once

been set in motion the speed is always increasing and each generation

improves upon the preceding both in physical and moral qualities the care of

the governors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from

innovation alter the songs of a country damon says and you will soon end by

altering its laws the change appears innocent at first and begins in play

but the evil soon becomes serious working secretly upon the characters of

individuals then upon social and commercial relations and lastly upon the

institutions of a state and there is ruin and confusion everywhere but if

education remains in the established form there will be no danger a

restorative process will be always going on the spirit of law and order will

raise up what has fallen down nor will any regulations be needed for the

lesser matters of liferules of deportment or fashions of dress like

invites like for good or for evil education will correct deficiencies and

supply the power of selfgovernment far be it from us to enter into the

particulars of legislation let the guardians take care of education and

education will take care of all other things




but without education they may patch and mend as they please they will make no

progress any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by some favourite

remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of living if you tell such

persons that they must first alter their habits then they grow angry they are

charming people charmingnay the very reverse evidently

these gentlemen are not in your good graces nor the state which is like them

and such states there are which first ordain under penalty of death that no one

shall alter the constitution and then suffer themselves to be flattered into

and out of anything and he who indulges them and fawns upon them is their

leader and saviour yes the men are as bad as the states but do

you not admire their cleverness nay some of them are stupid enough to

believe what the people tell them and when all the world is telling a

man that he is six feet high and he has no measure how can he believe

anything else but dont get into a passion to see our statesmen trying

their nostrums and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the hydralike

rogueries of mankind is as good as a play minute enactments are superfluous

in good states and are useless in bad ones




and now what remains of the work of legislation nothing for us but to apollo

the god of delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all

thingsthat is to say religion only our ancestral deity sitting upon

the centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any sense

in an affair of such magnitude no foreign god shall be supreme in our

realms




here as socrates would say let us reflect on greek what has

preceded thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens but

only of the wellbeing of the state they may be the happiest of men but our

principal aim in founding the state was not to make them happy they were to be

guardians not holidaymakers in this pleasant manner is presented to us the

famous question both of ancient and modern philosophy touching the relation of

duty to happiness of right to utility




first duty then happiness is the natural order of our moral ideas the

utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error and shows to us a

side of ethics which is apt to be neglected it may be admitted further that

right and utility are coextensive and that he who makes the happiness of

mankind his object has one of the highest and noblest motives of human action

but utility is not the historical basis of morality nor the aspect in which

moral and religious ideas commonly occur to the mind the greatest happiness of

all is as we believe the faroff result of the divine government of the

universe the greatest happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in

a life of virtue and goodness but we seem to be more assured of a law of right

than we can be of a divine purpose that all mankind should be

saved and we infer the one from the other and the greatest happiness

of the individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the ordinary

sense of the term and may be realised in a life of pain or in a voluntary

death further the word happiness has several ambiguities it

may mean either pleasure or an ideal life happiness subjective or objective

in this world or in another of ourselves only or of our neighbours and of all

men everywhere by the modern founder of utilitarianism the selfregarding and

disinterested motives of action are included under the same term although they

are commonly opposed by us as benevolence and selflove the word happiness has

not the definiteness or the sacredness of truth and

right it does not equally appeal to our higher nature and has

not sunk into the conscience of mankind it is associated too much with the

comforts and conveniences of life too little with the goods of the soul

which we desire for their own sake in a great trial or danger or

temptation or in any great and heroic action it is scarcely thought of for

these reasons the greatest happiness principle is not the true

foundation of ethics but though not the first principle it is the second

which is like unto it and is often of easier application for the larger part

of human actions are neither right nor wrong except in so far as they tend to

the happiness of mankind introd to gorgias and philebus




the same question reappears in politics where the useful or expedient seems to

claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority for concerning political

measures we chiefly ask how will they affect the happiness of mankind yet

here too we may observe that what we term expediency is merely the law of right

limited by the conditions of human society right and truth are the highest

aims of government as well as of individuals and we ought not to lose sight of

them because we cannot directly enforce them they appeal to the better mind of

nations and sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests to

resist they are the watchwords which all men use in matters of public policy

as well as in their private dealings the peace of europe may be said to depend

upon them in the most commercial and utilitarian states of society the power

of ideas remains and all the higher class of statesmen have in them something

of that idealism which pericles is said to have gathered from the teaching of

anaxagoras they recognise that the true leader of men must be above the

motives of ambition and that national character is of greater value than

material comfort and prosperity and this is the order of thought in plato

first he expects his citizens to do their duty and then under favourable

circumstances that is to say in a wellordered state their happiness is

assured that he was far from excluding the modern principle of utility in

politics is sufficiently evident from other passages in which the most

beneficial is affirmed to be the most honourable and also the

most sacred




we may note




 the manner in which the objection of adeimantus here is designed to draw

out and deepen the argument of socrates




 the conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of politics and

of art in the latter supplying the only principle of criticism which under

the various names of harmony symmetry measure proportion unity the greek

seems to have applied to works of art




 the requirement that the state should be limited in size after the

traditional model of a greek state as in the politics of aristotle the fact

that the cities of hellas were small is converted into a principle




 the humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep of the light

active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least of the

charming patients who are always making themselves worse or

again the playful assumption that there is no state but our own or the grave

irony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six feet high

because he is told so and having nothing to measure with is to be pardoned for

his ignorancehe is too amusing for us to be seriously angry with him




 the light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over when

provision has been made for two great principlesfirst that religion

shall be based on the highest conception of the gods secondly that the true

national or hellenic type shall be maintained




socrates proceeds but where amid all this is justice son of ariston tell me

where light a candle and search the city and get your brother and the rest of

our friends to help in seeking for her that wont do

replied glaucon you yourself promised to make the search and talked

about the impiety of deserting justice well i said i will lead the

way but do you follow my notion is that our state being perfect will contain

all the four virtueswisdom courage temperance justice if we

eliminate the three first the unknown remainder will be justice




first then of wisdom the state which we have called into being will be wise

because politic and policy is one among many kinds of skillnot the

skill of the carpenter or of the worker in metal or of the husbandman but

the skill of him who advises about the interests of the whole state of such a

kind is the skill of the guardians who are a small class in number far

smaller than the blacksmiths but in them is concentrated the wisdom of the

state and if this small ruling class have wisdom then the whole state will be

wise




our second virtue is courage which we have no difficulty in finding in another

classthat of soldiers courage may be defined as a sort of

salvationthe neverfailing salvation of the opinions which law and

education have prescribed concerning dangers you know the way in which dyers

first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple or of any

other colour colours dyed in this way become fixed and no soap or lye will

ever wash them out now the ground is education and the laws are the colours

and if the ground is properly laid neither the soap of pleasure nor the lye of

pain or fear will ever wash them out this power which preserves right opinion

about danger i would ask you to call courage adding the epithet

political or civilized in order to distinguish it

from mere animal courage and from a higher courage which may hereafter be

discussed




two virtues remain temperance and justice more than the preceding virtues

temperance suggests the idea of harmony some light is thrown upon the nature

of this virtue by the popular description of a man as master of

himselfwhich has an absurd sound because the master is also the

servant the expression really means that the better principle in a man masters

the worse there are in cities whole classeswomen slaves and the

likewho correspond to the worse and a few only to the better and in

our state the former class are held under control by the latter now to which

of these classes does temperance belong to both of them and our

state if any will be the abode of temperance and we were right in describing

this virtue as a harmony which is diffused through the whole making the

dwellers in the city to be of one mind and attuning the upper and middle and

lower classes like the strings of an instrument whether you suppose them to

differ in wisdom strength or wealth




and now we are near the spot let us draw in and surround the cover and watch

with all our eyes lest justice should slip away and escape tell me if you

see the thicket move first nay i would have you lead well

then offer up a prayer and follow the way is dark and difficult but we must

push on i begin to see a track good news why glaucon our

dulness of scent is quite ludicrous while we are straining our eyes into the

distance justice is tumbling out at our feet we are as bad as people looking

for a thing which they have in their hands have you forgotten our old

principle of the division of labour or of every man doing his own business

concerning which we spoke at the foundation of the statewhat but this

was justice is there any other virtue remaining which can compete with wisdom

and temperance and courage in the scale of political virtue for every

one having his own is the great object of government and the great

object of trade is that every man should do his own business not that there is

much harm in a carpenter trying to be a cobbler or a cobbler transforming

himself into a carpenter but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his

last and turning into a guardian or legislator or when a single individual is

trainer warrior legislator all in one and this evil is injustice or every

man doing anothers business i do not say that as yet we are in a

condition to arrive at a final conclusion for the definition which we believe

to hold good in states has still to be tested by the individual having read

the large letters we will now come back to the small from the two together a

brilliant light may be struck out




socrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of residues

each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the three parts of the

soul and one of the three classes in the state although the third temperance

has more of the nature of a harmony than the first two if there be a fourth

virtue that can only be sought for in the relation of the three parts in the

soul or classes in the state to one another it is obvious and simple and for

that very reason has not been found out the modern logician will be inclined

to object that ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances but that

they run into one another and may be only different aspects or names of the

same thing and such in this instance appears to be the case for the

definition here given of justice is verbally the same as one of the definitions

of temperance given by socrates in the charmides which however is only

provisional and is afterwards rejected and so far from justice remaining over

when the other virtues are eliminated the justice and temperance of the

republic can with difficulty be distinguished temperance appears to be the

virtue of a part only and one of three whereas justice is a universal virtue

of the whole soul yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort

of harmony and in this respect is akin to justice justice seems to differ

from temperance in degree rather than in kind whereas temperance is the

harmony of discordant elements justice is the perfect order by which all

natures and classes do their own business the right man in the right place

the division and cooperation of all the citizens justice again is a more

abstract notion than the other virtues and therefore from platos point

of view the foundation of them to which they are referred and which in idea

precedes them the proposal to omit temperance is a mere trick of style

intended to avoid monotony




there is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier dialogues of plato

protagoras arist nic ethics whether the virtues are one or

many this receives an answer which is to the effect that there are four

cardinal virtues now for the first time brought together in ethical

philosophy and one supreme over the rest which is not like aristotles

conception of universal justice virtue relative to others but the whole of

virtue relative to the parts to this universal conception of justice or order

in the first education and in the moral nature of man the still more universal

conception of the good in the second education and in the sphere of speculative

knowledge seems to succeed both might be equally described by the terms

law order harmony but while the

idea of good embraces all time and all existence the conception

of justice is not extended beyond man




socrates is now going to identify the individual and the state but first he

must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul his argument is

as followsquantity makes no difference in quality the word

just whether applied to the individual or to the state has the

same meaning and the term justice implied that the same three

principles in the state and in the individual were doing their own business

but are they really three or one the question is difficult and one which can

hardly be solved by the methods which we are now using but the truer and

longer way would take up too much of our time the shorter will satisfy

me well then you would admit that the qualities of states mean the

qualities of the individuals who compose them the scythians and thracians are

passionate our own race intellectual and the egyptians and phoenicians

covetous because the individual members of each have such and such a

character the difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are

one or three whether that is to say we reason with one part of our nature

desire with another are angry with another or whether the whole soul comes

into play in each sort of action this enquiry however requires a very exact

definition of terms the same thing in the same relation cannot be affected in

two opposite ways but there is no impossibility in a man standing still yet

moving his arms or in a top which is fixed on one spot going round upon its

axis there is no necessity to mention all the possible exceptions let us

provisionally assume that opposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the

same relation and to the class of opposites belong assent and dissent desire

and avoidance and one form of desire is thirst and hunger and here arises a

new pointthirst is thirst of drink hunger is hunger of food not of

warm drink or of a particular kind of food with the single exception of course

that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is good when

relative terms have no attributes their correlatives have no attributes when

they have attributes their correlatives also have them for example the term

greater is simply relative to less and knowledge

refers to a subject of knowledge but on the other hand a particular knowledge

is of a particular subject again every science has a distinct character

which is defined by an object medicine for example is the science of health

although not to be confounded with health having cleared our ideas thus far

let us return to the original instance of thirst which has a definite

objectdrink now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses the

animal one saying drink the rational one which says do

not drink the two impulses are contradictory and therefore we may

assume that they spring from distinct principles in the soul but is passion a

third principle or akin to desire there is a story of a certain leontius

which throws some light on this question he was coming up from the piraeus

outside the north wall and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying

by the executioner he felt a longing desire to see them and also an abhorrence

of them at first he turned away and shut his eyes then suddenly tearing them

open he saidtake your fill ye wretches of the fair

sight now is there not here a third principle which is often found to

come to the assistance of reason against desire but never of desire against

reason this is passion or spirit of the separate existence of which we may

further convince ourselves by putting the following casewhen a man

suffers justly if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant at the

hardships which he undergoes but when he suffers unjustly his indignation is

his great support hunger and thirst cannot tame him the spirit within him

must do or die until the voice of the shepherd that is of reason bidding

his dog bark no more is heard within this shows that passion is the ally of

reason is passion then the same with reason no for the former exists in

children and brutes and homer affords a proof of the distinction between them

when he says he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul




and now at last we have reached firm ground and are able to infer that the

virtues of the state and of the individual are the same for wisdom and courage

and justice in the state are severally the wisdom and courage and justice in

the individuals who form the state each of the three classes will do the work

of its own class in the state and each part in the individual soul reason

the superior and passion the inferior will be harmonized by the influence of

music and gymnastic the counsellor and the warrior the head and the arm will

act together in the town of mansoul and keep the desires in proper subjection

the courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves a right opinion

about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains the wisdom of the counsellor is

that small part of the soul which has authority and reason the virtue of

temperance is the friendship of the ruling and the subject principles both in

the state and in the individual of justice we have already spoken and the

notion already given of it may be confirmed by common instances will the just

state or the just individual steal lie commit adultery or be guilty of

impiety to gods and men no and is not the reason of this that

the several principles whether in the state or in the individual do their own

business and justice is the quality which makes just men and just states

moreover our old division of labour which required that there should be one

man for one use was a dream or anticipation of what was to follow and that

dream has now been realized in justice which begins by binding together the

three chords of the soul and then acts harmoniously in every relation of life

and injustice which is the insubordination and disobedience of the inferior

elements in the soul is the opposite of justice and is inharmonious and

unnatural being to the soul what disease is to the body for in the soul as

well as in the body good or bad actions produce good or bad habits and virtue

is the health and beauty and wellbeing of the soul and vice is the disease

and weakness and deformity of the soul




again the old question returns upon us is justice or injustice the more

profitable the question has become ridiculous for injustice like mortal

disease makes life not worth having come up with me to the hill which

overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of virtue and the

infinite forms of vice among which are four special ones characteristic both

of states and of individuals and the state which corresponds to the single

form of virtue is that which we have been describing wherein reason rules

under one of two namesmonarchy and aristocracy thus there are five

forms in all both of states and of souls




in attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties plato takes

occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties and the criterion which

he proposes is difference in the working of the faculties the same faculty

cannot produce contradictory effects but the path of early reasoners is beset

by thorny entanglements and he will not proceed a step without first clearing

the ground this leads him into a tiresome digression which is intended to

explain the nature of contradiction first the contradiction must be at the

same time and in the same relation secondly no extraneous word must be

introduced into either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is

expressed for example thirst is of drink not of warm drink he implies what

he does not say that if by the advice of reason or by the impulse of anger

a man is restrained from drinking this proves that thirst or desire under

which thirst is included is distinct from anger and reason but suppose that

we allow the term thirst or desire to be modified

and say an angry thirst or a revengeful desire

then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become confused this case

therefore has to be excluded and still there remains an exception to the rule

in the use of the term good which is always implied in the

object of desire these are the discussions of an age before logic and any one

who is wearied by them should remember that they are necessary to the clearing

up of ideas in the first development of the human faculties




the psychology of plato extends no further than the division of the soul into

the rational irascible and concupiscent elements which as far as we know

was first made by him and has been retained by aristotle and succeeding

ethical writers the chief difficulty in this early analysis of the mind is to

define exactly the place of the irascible faculty greek which may be

variously described under the terms righteous indignation spirit passion it

is the foundation of courage which includes in plato moral courage the

courage of enduring pain and of surmounting intellectual difficulties as well

as of meeting dangers in war though irrational it inclines to side with the

rational it cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted it

sometimes takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the

performance of great actions it is the lion heart with which the

reason makes a treaty on the other hand it is negative rather than positive

it is indignant at wrong or falsehood but does not like love in the symposium

and phaedrus aspire to the vision of truth or good it is the peremptory

military spirit which prevails in the government of honour it differs from

anger greek this latter term having no accessory notion of righteous

indignation although aristotle has retained the word yet we may observe that

passion greek has with him lost its affinity to the rational

and has become indistinguishable from anger greek and to this

vernacular use plato himself in the laws seems to revert though not always by

modern philosophy too as well as in our ordinary conversation the words anger

or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense there is no

connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are aroused the

feeling of righteous indignation is too partial and accidental to

admit of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit we are tempted also to

doubt whether plato is right in supposing that an offender however justly

condemned could be expected to acknowledge the justice of his sentence this

is the spirit of a philosopher or martyr rather than of a criminal




we may observe how nearly plato approaches aristotles famous thesis

that good actions produce good habits the words as

healthy practices greek produce health so do just practices produce

justice have a sound very like the nicomachean ethics but we note also

that an incidental remark in plato has become a farreaching principle in

aristotle and an inseparable part of a great ethical system




there is a difficulty in understanding what plato meant by the longer

way he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not

be satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction in the sixth and

seventh books compare sophist and parmenides he has given us a sketch of such

a metaphysic but when glaucon asks for the final revelation of the idea of

good he is put off with the declaration that he has not yet studied the

preliminary sciences how he would have filled up the sketch or argued about

such questions from a higher point of view we can only conjecture perhaps he

hoped to find some a priori method of developing the parts out of the whole or

he might have asked which of the ideas contains the other ideas and possibly

have stumbled on the hegelian identity of the ego and the

universal or he may have imagined that ideas might be

constructed in some manner analogous to the construction of figures and numbers

in the mathematical sciences the most certain and necessary truth was to plato

the universal and to this he was always seeking to refer all knowledge or

opinion just as in modern times we seek to rest them on the opposite pole of

induction and experience the aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended

to pass beyond the limits of human thought and language they seem to have

reached a height at which they are moving about in worlds

unrealized and their conceptions although profoundly affecting their

own minds become invisible or unintelligible to others we are not therefore

surprized to find that plato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine

of ideas or that his school in a later generation like his contemporaries

glaucon and adeimantus were unable to follow him in this region of

speculation in the sophist where he is refuting the scepticism which

maintained either that there was no such thing as predication or that all

might be predicated of all he arrives at the conclusion that some ideas

combine with some but not all with all but he makes only one or two steps

forward on this path he nowhere attains to any connected system of ideas or

even to a knowledge of the most elementary relations of the sciences to one

another




book v i was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in states

when polemarchushe was sitting a little farther from me than

adeimantustaking him by the coat and leaning towards him said something

in an undertone of which i only caught the words shall we let him

off certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice

whom i said are you not going to let off you he said why

because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting

women and children of whom you have slily disposed under the general formula

that friends have all things in common and was i not right

yes he replied but there are many sorts of communism or

community and we want to know which of them is right the company as you have

just heard are resolved to have a further explanation thrasymachus

said do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold or to hear

you discourse yes i said but the discourse should be of a reasonable

length glaucon added yes socrates and there is reason in spending

the whole of life in such discussions but pray without more ado tell us how

this community is to be carried out and how the interval between birth and

education is to be filled up well i said the subject has several

difficultieswhat is possible is the first question what is desirable

is the second fear not he replied for you are speaking

among friends that i replied is a sorry consolation i shall destroy

my friends as well as myself not that i mind a little innocent laughter but

he who kills the truth is a murderer then said glaucon

laughing in case you should murder us we will acquit you beforehand

and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiving us




socrates proceedsthe guardians of our state are to be watchdogs as we

have already said now dogs are not divided into hes and sheswe do not

take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home to look

after their puppies they have the same employmentsthe only difference

between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other weaker but if women

are to have the same employments as men they must have the same

educationthey must be taught music and gymnastics and the art of war i

know that a great joke will be made of their riding on horseback and carrying

weapons the sight of the naked old wrinkled women showing their agility in the

palaestra will certainly not be a vision of beauty and may be expected to

become a famous jest but we must not mind the wits there was a time when they

might have laughed at our present gymnastics all is habit people have at last

found out that the exposure is better than the concealment of the person and

now they laugh no more evil only should be the subject of ridicule




the first question is whether women are able either wholly or partially to

share in the employments of men and here we may be charged with inconsistency

in making the proposal at all for we started originally with the division of

labour and the diversity of employments was based on the difference of

natures but is there no difference between men and women nay are they not

wholly different there was the difficulty glaucon which made me unwilling to

speak of family relations however when a man is out of his depth whether in

a pool or in an ocean he can only swim for his life and we must try to find a

way of escape if we can




the argument is that different natures have different uses and the natures of

men and women are said to differ but this is only a verbal opposition we do

not consider that the difference may be purely nominal and accidental for

example a bald man and a hairy man are opposed in a single point of view but

you cannot infer that because a bald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to

be a cobbler now why is such an inference erroneous simply because the

opposition between them is partial only like the difference between a male

physician and a female physician not running through the whole nature like

the difference between a physician and a carpenter and if the difference of

the sexes is only that the one beget and the other bear children this does not

prove that they ought to have distinct educations admitting that women differ

from men in capacity do not men equally differ from one another has not

nature scattered all the qualities which our citizens require indifferently up

and down among the two sexes and even in their peculiar pursuits are not

women often though in some cases superior to men ridiculously enough

surpassed by them women are the same in kind as men and have the same

aptitude or want of aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war but in a less

degree one woman will be a good guardian another not and the good must be

chosen to be the colleagues of our guardians if however their natures are the

same the inference is that their education must also be the same there is no

longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning music and

gymnastic and the education which we give them will be the very best far

superior to that of cobblers and will train up the very best women and

nothing can be more advantageous to the state than this therefore let them

strip clothed in their chastity and share in the toils of war and in the

defence of their country he who laughs at them is a fool for his pains




the first wave is past and the argument is compelled to admit that men and

women have common duties and pursuits a second and greater wave is rolling

incommunity of wives and children is this either expedient or possible

the expediency i do not doubt i am not so sure of the possibility nay

i think that a considerable doubt will be entertained on both points i

meant to have escaped the trouble of proving the first but as you have

detected the little stratagem i must even submit only allow me to feed my

fancy like the solitary in his walks with a dream of what might be and then i

will return to the question of what can be




in the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones where

they are wanted and their allies or ministers will obey you as legislator

have already selected the men and now you shall select the women after the

selection has been made they will dwell in common houses and have their meals

in common and will be brought together by a necessity more certain than that

of mathematics but they cannot be allowed to live in licentiousness that is

an unholy thing which the rulers are determined to prevent for the avoidance

of this holy marriage festivals will be instituted and their holiness will be

in proportion to their usefulness and here glaucon i should like to ask as

i know that you are a breeder of birds and animals do you not take the

greatest care in the mating certainly and there is no reason to

suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human beings but then

our rulers must be skilful physicians of the state for they will often need a

strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desirable unions between their

subjects the good must be paired with the good and the bad with the bad and

the offspring of the one must be reared and of the other destroyed in this

way the flock will be preserved in prime condition hymeneal festivals will be

celebrated at times fixed with an eye to population and the brides and

bridegrooms will meet at them and by an ingenious system of lots the rulers

will contrive that the brave and the fair come together and that those of

inferior breed are paired with inferiorsthe latter will ascribe to

chance what is really the invention of the rulers and when children are born

the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried to an enclosure in a

certain part of the city and there attended by suitable nurses the rest will

be hurried away to places unknown the mothers will be brought to the fold and

will suckle the children care however must be taken that none of them

recognise their own offspring and if necessary other nurses may also be hired

the trouble of watching and getting up at night will be transferred to

attendants then the wives of our guardians will have a fine easy time

when they are having children and quite right too i said that they

should




the parents ought to be in the prime of life which for a man may be reckoned

at thirty yearsfrom twentyfive when he has passed the point at

which the speed of life is greatest to fiftyfive and at twenty years

for a womanfrom twenty to forty any one above or below those ages who

partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety also every one who forms

a marriage connexion at other times without the consent of the rulers this

latter regulation applies to those who are within the specified ages after

which they may range at will provided they avoid the prohibited degrees of

parents and children or of brothers and sisters which last however are not

absolutely prohibited if a dispensation be procured but how shall we

know the degrees of affinity when all things are common the answer is

that brothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months after

the espousals and their parents those who are then espoused and every one

will have many children and every child many parents




socrates proceeds i have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous and

also consistent with our entire polity the greatest good of a state is unity

the greatest evil discord and distraction and there will be unity where there

are no private pleasures or pains or interestswhere if one member

suffers all the members suffer if one citizen is touched all are quickly

sensitive and the least hurt to the little finger of the state runs through

the whole body and vibrates to the soul for the true state like an

individual is injured as a whole when any part is affected every state has

subjects and rulers who in a democracy are called rulers and in other states

masters but in our state they are called saviours and allies and the subjects

who in other states are termed slaves are by us termed nurturers and

paymasters and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other places

are by us called fathers and brothers and whereas in other states members of

the same government regard one of their colleagues as a friend and another as

an enemy in our state no man is a stranger to another for every citizen is

connected with every other by ties of blood and these names and this way of

speaking will have a corresponding realitybrother father sister

mother repeated from infancy in the ears of children will not be mere words

then again the citizens will have all things in common in having common

property they will have common pleasures and pains




can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind or lawsuits

about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they call their

own or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend himself the

permission to strike when insulted will be an antidote to the

knife and will prevent disturbances in the state but no younger man will

strike an elder reverence will prevent him from laying hands on his kindred

and he will fear that the rest of the family may retaliate moreover our

citizens will be rid of the lesser evils of life there will be no flattery of

the rich no sordid household cares no borrowing and not paying compared with

the citizens of other states ours will be olympic victors and crowned with

blessings greater stillthey and their children having a better

maintenance during life and after death an honourable burial nor has the

happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the state our

olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler but he has a happiness

beyond that of any cobbler at the same time if any conceited youth begins to

dream of appropriating the state to himself he must be reminded that

half is better than the whole i should certainly advise

him to stay where he is when he has the promise of such a brave life




but is such a community possibleas among the animals so also among

men and if possible in what way possible about war there is no difficulty

the principle of communism is adapted to military service parents will take

their children to look on at a battle just as potters boys are trained

to the business by looking on at the wheel and to the parents themselves as

to other animals the sight of their young ones will prove a great incentive to

bravery young warriors must learn but they must not run into danger although

a certain degree of risk is worth incurring when the benefit is great the

young creatures should be placed under the care of experienced veterans and

they should have wingsthat is to say swift and tractable steeds on

which they may fly away and escape one of the first things to be done is to

teach a youth to ride




cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen gentlemen

who allow themselves to be taken prisoners may be presented to the enemy but

what shall be done to the hero first of all he shall be crowned by all the

youths in the army secondly he shall receive the right hand of fellowship

and thirdly do you think that there is any harm in his being kissed we have

already determined that he shall have more wives than others in order that he

may have as many children as possible and at a feast he shall have more to

eat we have the authority of homer for honouring brave men with long

chines which is an appropriate compliment because meat is a very

strengthening thing fill the bowl then and give the best seats and meats to

the bravemay they do them good and he who dies in battle will be at

once declared to be of the golden race and will as we believe become one of

hesiods guardian angels he shall be worshipped after death in the

manner prescribed by the oracle and not only he but all other benefactors of

the state who die in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours




the next question is how shall we treat our enemies shall hellenes be

enslaved no for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing under the

yoke of the barbarians or shall the dead be despoiled certainly not for that

sort of thing is an excuse for skulking and has been the ruin of many an army

there is meanness and feminine malice in making an enemy of the dead body when

the soul which was the owner has fledlike a dog who cannot reach his

assailants and quarrels with the stones which are thrown at him instead

again the arms of hellenes should not be offered up in the temples of the

gods they are a pollution for they are taken from brethren and on similar

grounds there should be a limit to the devastation of hellenic

territorythe houses should not be burnt nor more than the annual

produce carried off for war is of two kinds civil and foreign the first of

which is properly termed discord and only the second

war and war between hellenes is in reality civil wara

quarrel in a family which is ever to be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural

and ought to be prosecuted with a view to reconciliation in a true

philhellenic spirit as of those who would chasten but not utterly enslave

the war is not against a whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men

women and children but only against a few guilty persons when they are

punished peace will be restored that is the way in which hellenes should war

against one anotherand against barbarians as they war against one

another now




but my dear socrates you are forgetting the main question is such a

state possible i grant all and more than you say about the blessedness of

being one familyfathers brothers mothers daughters going out to war

together but i want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal state

you are too unmerciful the first wave and the second wave i have hardly

escaped and now you will certainly drown me with the third when you see the

towering crest of the wave i expect you to take pity not a

whit




well then we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after justice

and the just man answered to the just state is this ideal at all the worse for

being impracticable would the picture of a perfectly beautiful man be any the

worse because no such man ever lived can any reality come up to the idea

nature will not allow words to be fully realized but if i am to try and

realize the ideal of the state in a measure i think that an approach may be

made to the perfection of which i dream by one or two i do not say slight but

possible changes in the present constitution of states i would reduce them to

a single onethe great wave as i call it until then kings are

philosophers or philosophers are kings cities will never cease from ill no

nor the human race nor will our ideal polity ever come into being i know that

this is a hard saying which few will be able to receive socrates all

the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones and

therefore i would advise you to prepare an answer you got me into the

scrape i said and i was right he replied however i

will stand by you as a sort of donothing wellmeaning ally having the

help of such a champion i will do my best to maintain my position and first

i must explain of whom i speak and what sort of natures these are who are to be

philosophers and rulers as you are a man of pleasure you will not have

forgotten how indiscriminate lovers are in their attachments they love all

and turn blemishes into beauties the snubnosed youth is said to have a

winning grace the beak of another has a royal look the featureless are

faultless the dark are manly the fair angels the sickly have a new term of

endearment invented expressly for them which is honeypale

lovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their

affection in every form now here comes the pointthe philosopher too is

a lover of knowledge in every form he has an insatiable curiosity but

will curiosity make a philosopher are the lovers of sights and sounds who let

out their ears to every chorus at the dionysiac festivals to be called

philosophers they are not true philosophers but only an imitation

then how are we to describe the true




you would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas such as justice beauty

good evil which are severally one yet in their various combinations appear

to be many those who recognize these realities are philosophers whereas the

other class hear sounds and see colours and understand their use in the arts

but cannot attain to the true or waking vision of absolute justice or beauty or

truth they have not the light of knowledge but of opinion and what they see

is a dream only perhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us can

we pacify him without revealing the disorder of his mind suppose we say that

if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it but knowledge must be of something

which is as ignorance is of something which is not and there is a third

thing which both is and is not and is matter of opinion only opinion and

knowledge then having distinct objects must also be distinct faculties and

by faculties i mean powers unseen and distinguishable only by the difference in

their objects as opinion and knowledge differ since the one is liable to err

but the other is unerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties if being

is the object of knowledge and notbeing of ignorance and these are the

extremes opinion must lie between them and may be called darker than the one

and brighter than the other this intermediate or contingent matter is and is

not at the same time and partakes both of existence and of nonexistence now

i would ask my good friend who denies abstract beauty and justice and affirms

a many beautiful and a many just whether everything he sees is not in some

point of view differentthe beautiful ugly the pious impious the just

unjust is not the double also the half and are not heavy and light relative

terms which pass into one another everything is and is not as in the old

riddlea man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a

bird with a stone and not a stone the mind cannot be fixed on either

alternative and these ambiguous intermediate erring halflighted objects

which have a disorderly movement in the region between being and notbeing are

the proper matter of opinion as the immutable objects are the proper matter of

knowledge and he who grovels in the world of sense and has only this

uncertain perception of things is not a philosopher but a lover of opinion

only




the fifth book is the new beginning of the republic in which the community of

property and of family are first maintained and the transition is made to the

kingdom of philosophers for both of these plato after his manner has been

preparing in some chance words of book iv which fall unperceived on the

readers mind as they are supposed at first to have fallen on the ear of

glaucon and adeimantus the paradoxes as morgenstern terms them

of this book of the republic will be reserved for another place a few remarks

on the style and some explanations of difficulties may be briefly added




first there is the image of the waves which serves for a sort of scheme or

plan of the book the first wave the second wave the third and greatest wave

come rolling in and we hear the roar of them all that can be said of the

extravagance of platos proposals is anticipated by himself nothing is

more admirable than the hesitation with which he proposes the solemn text

until kings are philosophers etc or the reaction from the

sublime to the ridiculous when glaucon describes the manner in which the new

truth will be received by mankind




some defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the communistic

plan nothing is told us of the application of communism to the lower classes

nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of being made out it is quite

possible that a child born at one hymeneal festival may marry one of its own

brothers or sisters or even one of its parents at another plato is afraid of

incestuous unions but at the same time he does not wish to bring before us the

fact that the city would be divided into families of those born seven and nine

months after each hymeneal festival if it were worth while to argue seriously

about such fancies we might remark that while all the old affinities are

abolished the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural or rational

principle but only upon the accident of children having been born in the same

month and year nor does he explain how the lots could be so manipulated by the

legislature as to bring together the fairest and best the singular expression

which is employed to describe the age of fiveandtwenty may perhaps be taken

from some poet




in the delineation of the philosopher the illustrations of the nature of

philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of glaucon

the athenian man of pleasure than to modern tastes or feelings they are

partly facetious but also contain a germ of truth that science is a whole

remains a true principle of inductive as well as of metaphysical philosophy

and the love of universal knowledge is still the characteristic of the

philosopher in modern as well as in ancient times




at the end of the fifth book plato introduces the figment of contingent matter

which has exercised so great an influence both on the ethics and theology of

the modern world and which occurs here for the first time in the history of

philosophy he did not remark that the degrees of knowledge in the subject have

nothing corresponding to them in the object with him a word must answer to an

idea and he could not conceive of an opinion which was an opinion about

nothing the influence of analogy led him to invent parallels and

conjugates and to overlook facts to us some of his difficulties are

puzzling only from their simplicity we do not perceive that the answer to them

is tumbling out at our feet to the mind of early thinkers the

conception of notbeing was dark and mysterious they did not see that this

terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge was only a

logical determination the common term under which through the accidental use

of language two entirely different ideas were included was another source of

confusion thus through the ambiguity of greek plato attempting to introduce

order into the first chaos of human thought seems to have confused perception

and opinion and to have failed to distinguish the contingent from the

relative in the theaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up

in the sophist the second and for this as well as for other reasons both

these dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the republic




book vi having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being and

have no clear patterns in their minds of justice beauty truth and that

philosophers have such patterns we have now to ask whether they or the many

shall be rulers in our state but who can doubt that philosophers should be

chosen if they have the other qualities which are required in a ruler for

they are lovers of the knowledge of the eternal and of all truth they are

haters of falsehood their meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of

knowledge they are spectators of all time and all existence and in the

magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing to them nor

is death fearful also they are of a social gracious disposition equally free

from cowardice and arrogance they learn and remember easily they have

harmonious wellregulated minds truth flows to them sweetly by nature can

the god of jealousy himself find any fault with such an assemblage of good

qualities




here adeimantus interposesno man can answer you socrates but

every man feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument he is

driven from one position to another until he has nothing more to say just as

an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by a more skilled

opponent and yet all the time he may be right he may know in this very

instance that those who make philosophy the business of their lives generally

turn out rogues if they are bad men and fools if they are good what do you

say i should say that he is quite right then how is such an

admission reconcileable with the doctrine that philosophers should be

kings




i shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a hand i

am at the invention of allegories the relation of good men to their

governments is so peculiar that in order to defend them i must take an

illustration from the world of fiction conceive the captain of a ship taller

by a head and shoulders than any of the crew yet a little deaf a little

blind and rather ignorant of the seamans art the sailors want to

steer although they know nothing of the art and they have a theory that it

cannot be learned if the helm is refused them they drug the captains

posset bind him hand and foot and take possession of the ship he who joins

in the mutiny is termed a good pilot and what not they have no conception that

the true pilot must observe the winds and the stars and must be their master

whether they like it or notsuch an one would be called by them fool

prater stargazer this is my parable which i will beg you to interpret for

me to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name and to

explain to them that not he but those who will not use him are to blame for

his uselessness the philosopher should not beg of mankind to be put in

authority over them the wise man should not seek the rich as the proverb

bids but every man whether rich or poor must knock at the door of the

physician when he has need of him now the pilot is the philosopherhe

whom in the parable they call stargazer and the mutinous sailors are the mob

of politicians by whom he is rendered useless not that these are the worst

enemies of philosophy who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons

when they are corrupted by the world need i recall the original image of the

philosopher did we not say of him just now that he loved truth and hated

falsehood and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of phenomena but was

led by a sympathy in his own nature to the contemplation of the absolute all

the virtues as well as truth who is the leader of them took up their abode in

his soul but as you were observing if we turn aside to view the reality we

see that the persons who were thus described with the exception of a small and

useless class are utter rogues




the point which has to be considered is the origin of this corruption in

nature every one will admit that the philosopher in our description of him

is a rare being but what numberless causes tend to destroy these rare beings

there is no good thing which may not be a cause of evilhealth wealth

strength rank and the virtues themselves when placed under unfavourable

circumstances for as in the animal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most

need the accompaniment of good air and soil so the best of human characters

turn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil whereas weak natures

hardly ever do any considerable good or harm they are not the stuff out of

which either great criminals or great heroes are made the philosopher follows

the same analogy he is either the best or the worst of all men some persons

say that the sophists are the corrupters of youth but is not public opinion

the real sophist who is everywhere presentin those very persons in the

assembly in the courts in the camp in the applauses and hisses of the

theatre reechoed by the surrounding hills will not a young mans heart

leap amid these discordant sounds and will any education save him from being

carried away by the torrent nor is this all for if he will not yield to

opinion there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death what principle

of rival sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an unequal contest

characters there may be more than human who are exceptionsgod may save

a man but not his own strength further i would have you consider that the

hireling sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions he is the

keeper of the monster who knows how to flatter or anger him and observes the

meaning of his inarticulate grunts good is what pleases him evil what he

dislikes truth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute such

is the sophists wisdom and such is the condition of those who make

public opinion the test of truth whether in art or in morals the curse is

laid upon them of being and doing what it approves and when they attempt first

principles the failure is ludicrous think of all this and ask yourself whether

the world is more likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea or in the

multiplicity of phenomena and the world if not a believer in the idea cannot

be a philosopher and must therefore be a persecutor of philosophers there is

another evilthe world does not like to lose the gifted nature and so

they flatter the young alcibiades into a magnificent opinion of his own

capacity the tall proper youth begins to expand and is dreaming of kingdoms

and empires if at this instant a friend whispers to him now the gods

lighten thee thou art a great fool and must be educateddo you

think that he will listen or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted

towards philosophy will they not make herculean efforts to spoil and corrupt

him are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge no less than

riches may divert him men of this class critias often become

politiciansthey are the authors of great mischief in states and

sometimes also of great good and thus philosophy is deserted by her natural

protectors and others enter in and dishonour her vulgar little minds see the

land open and rush from the prisons of the arts into her temple a clever

mechanic having a soul coarse as his body thinks that he will gain caste by

becoming her suitor for philosophy even in her fallen estate has a dignity

of her ownand he like a bald little blacksmiths apprentice as he

is having made some money and got out of durance washes and dresses himself

as a bridegroom and marries his masters daughter what will be the issue

of such marriages will they not be vile and bastard devoid of truth and

nature they will small then is the remnant of genuine

philosophers there may be a few who are citizens of small states in which

politics are not worth thinking of or who have been detained by theages

bridle of ill health for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique

and too rare to be worth mentioning and these few when they have tasted the

pleasures of philosophy and have taken a look at that den of thieves and place

of wild beasts which is human life will stand aside from the storm under the

shelter of a wall and try to preserve their own innocence and to depart in

peace a great work too will have been accomplished by them

great yes but not the greatest for man is a social being and can only

attain his highest development in the society which is best suited to him




enough then of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name another

question is which of existing states is suited to her not one of them at

present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in a strange soil only

in her proper state will she be shown to be of heavenly growth and is

her proper state ours or some other ours in all points but one which

was left undetermined you may remember our saying that some living mind or

witness of the legislator was needed in states but we were afraid to enter

upon a subject of such difficulty and now the question recurs and has not

grown easierhow may philosophy be safely studied let us bring her into

the light of day and make an end of the inquiry




in the first place i say boldly that nothing can be worse than the present

mode of study persons usually pick up a little philosophy in early youth and

in the intervals of business but they never master the real difficulty which

is dialectic later perhaps they occasionally go to a lecture on philosophy

years advance and the sun of philosophy unlike that of heracleitus sets

never to rise again this order of education should be reversed it should

begin with gymnastics in youth and as the man strengthens he should increase

the gymnastics of his soul then when active life is over let him finally

return to philosophy you are in earnest socrates but the world will

be equally earnest in withstanding youno more than thrasymachus

do not make a quarrel between thrasymachus and me who were never enemies and

are now good friends enough and i shall do my best to convince him and all

mankind of the truth of my words or at any rate to prepare for the future

when in another life we may again take part in similar discussions

that will be a long time hence not long in comparison with

eternity the many will probably remain incredulous for they have never seen

the natural unity of ideas but only artificial juxtapositions not free and

generous thoughts but tricks of controversy and quips of lawa perfect

man ruling in a perfect state even a single one they have not known and we

foresaw that there was no chance of perfection either in states or individuals

until a necessity was laid upon philosophersnot the rogues but those

whom we called the useless classof holding office or until the sons of

kings were inspired with a true love of philosophy whether in the infinity of

past time there has been or is in some distant land or ever will be

hereafter an ideal such as we have described we stoutly maintain that there

has been is and will be such a state whenever the muse of philosophy rules

will you say that the world is of another mind o my friend do not revile the

world they will soon change their opinion if they are gently entreated and

are taught the true nature of the philosopher who can hate a man who loves

him or be jealous of one who has no jealousy consider again that the many

hate not the true but the false philosophersthe pretenders who force

their way in without invitation and are always speaking of persons and not of

principles which is unlike the spirit of philosophy for the true philosopher

despises earthly strife his eye is fixed on the eternal order in accordance

with which he moulds himself into the divine image and not himself only but

other men and is the creator of the virtues private as well as public when

mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image

will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it certainly

not but what will be the process of delineation the artist will do

nothing until he has made a tabula rasa on this he will inscribe the

constitution of a state glancing often at the divine truth of nature and from

that deriving the godlike among men mingling the two elements rubbing out and

painting in until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine and

human but perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an artist what

will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth having a nature akin

to the bestand if they admit this will they still quarrel with us for

making philosophers our kings they will be less disposed to

quarrel let us assume then that they are pacified still a person may

hesitate about the probability of the son of a king being a philosopher and we

do not deny that they are very liable to be corrupted but yet surely in the

course of ages there might be one exceptionand one is enough if one son

of a king were a philosopher and had obedient citizens he might bring the

ideal polity into being hence we conclude that our laws are not only the best

but that they are also possible though not free from difficulty




i gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose concerning

women and children i will be wiser now and acknowledge that we must go to the

bottom of another question what is to be the education of our guardians it

was agreed that they were to be lovers of their country and were to be tested

in the refiners fire of pleasures and pains and those who came forth

pure and remained fixed in their principles were to have honours and rewards in

life and after death but at this point the argument put on her veil and

turned into another path i hesitated to make the assertion which i now

hazardthat our guardians must be philosophers you remember all the

contradictory elements which met in the philosopherhow difficult to

find them all in a single person intelligence and spirit are not often

combined with steadiness the stolid fearless nature is averse to

intellectual toil and yet these opposite elements are all necessary and

therefore as we were saying before the aspirant must be tested in pleasures

and dangers and also as we must now further add in the highest branches of

knowledge you will remember that when we spoke of the virtues mention was

made of a longer road which you were satisfied to leave unexplored

enough seemed to have been said enough my friend but what is

enough while anything remains wanting of all men the guardian must not faint

in the search after truth he must be prepared to take the longer road or he

will never reach that higher region which is above the four virtues and of the

virtues too he must not only get an outline but a clear and distinct vision

strange that we should be so precise about trifles so careless about the

highest truths and what are the highest you to pretend

unconsciousness when you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good

about which we know so little and without which though a man gain the world he

has no profit of it some people imagine that the good is wisdom but this

involves a circlethe good they say is wisdom wisdom has to do with

the good according to others the good is pleasure but then comes the

absurdity that good is bad for there are bad pleasures as well as good again

the good must have reality a man may desire the appearance of virtue but he

will not desire the appearance of good ought our guardians then to be ignorant

of this supreme principle of which every man has a presentiment and without

which no man has any real knowledge of anything but socrates what is

this supreme principle knowledge or pleasure or what you may think me

troublesome but i say that you have no business to be always repeating the

doctrines of others instead of giving us your own can i say what i do

not know you may offer an opinion and will the blindness and

crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty

of science i will only ask you to give such an explanation of the good

as you have given already of temperance and justice i wish that i

could but in my present mood i cannot reach to the height of the knowledge of

the good to the parent or principal i cannot introduce you but to the child

begotten in his image which i may compare with the interest on the principal

i will audit the account and do not let me give you a false statement of the

debt you remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one

beautiful the particular and the universal the objects of sight and the

objects of thought did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a

faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses requiring

not only objects of sense but also a medium which is light without which the

sight will not distinguish between colours and all will be a blank for light

is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived and

the god who gives us light is the sun who is the eye of the day but is not to

be confounded with the eye of man this eye of the day or sun is what i call

the child of the good standing in the same relation to the visible world as

the good to the intellectual when the sun shines the eye sees and in the

intellectual world where truth is there is sight and light now that which is

the sun of intelligent natures is the idea of good the cause of knowledge and

truth yet other and fairer than they are and standing in the same relation to

them in which the sun stands to light o inconceivable height of beauty which

is above knowledge and above truth you cannot surely mean

pleasure he said peace i replied and this idea of good like the

sun is also the cause of growth and the author not of knowledge only but of

being yet greater far than either in dignity and power that is a reach

of thought more than human but pray go on with the image for i suspect that

there is more behind there is i said and bearing in mind our two suns

or principles imagine further their corresponding worldsone of the

visible the other of the intelligible you may assist your fancy by figuring

the distinction under the image of a line divided into two unequal parts and

may again subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the

stages of knowledge in either sphere the lower portion of the lower or visible

sphere will consist of shadows and reflections and its upper and smaller

portion will contain real objects in the world of nature or of art the sphere

of the intelligible will also have two divisionsone of mathematics in

which there is no ascent but all is descent no inquiring into premises but

only drawing of inferences in this division the mind works with figures and

numbers the images of which are taken not from the shadows but from the

objects although the truth of them is seen only with the minds eye and

they are used as hypotheses without being analysed whereas in the other

division reason uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the

idea of good to which she fastens them and then again descends walking

firmly in the region of ideas and of ideas only in her ascent as well as

descent and finally resting in them i partly understand he

replied you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the

hypothetical metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or

sciences whichever is to be the name of them and the latter conceptions you

refuse to make subjects of pure intellect because they have no first

principle although when resting on a first principle they pass into the

higher sphere you understand me very well i said and now to those

four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding

facultiespure intelligence to the highest sphere active intelligence to

the second to the third faith to the fourth the perception of

shadowsand the clearness of the several faculties will be in the same

ratio as the truth of the objects to which they are related




like socrates we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher in language

which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and country he is

described as the spectator of all time and all existence he has

the noblest gifts of nature and makes the highest use of them all his desires

are absorbed in the love of wisdom which is the love of truth none of the

graces of a beautiful soul are wanting in him neither can he fear death or

think much of human life the ideal of modern times hardly retains the

simplicity of the antique there is not the same originality either in truth or

error which characterized the greeks the philosopher is no longer living in

the unseen nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance nor

does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by regular stages

to the idea of good the eagerness of the pursuit has abated there is more

division of labour and less of comprehensive reflection upon nature and human

life as a whole more of exact observation and less of anticipation and

inspiration still in the altered conditions of knowledge the parallel is not

wholly lost and there may be a use in translating the conception of plato into

the language of our own age the philosopher in modern times is one who fixes

his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion not on

fragments or pictures of nature on history not on controversy on the truths

which are acknowledged by the few not on the opinions of the many he is aware

of the importance of classifying according to nature and will

try to separate the limbs of science without breaking them

phaedr there is no part of truth whether great or small which he will

dishonour and in the least things he will discern the greatest parmen like

the ancient philosopher he sees the world pervaded by analogies but he can

also tell why in some cases a single instance is sufficient for an

induction mills logic while in other cases a thousand examples

would prove nothing he inquires into a portion of knowledge only because the

whole has grown too vast to be embraced by a single mind or life he has a

clearer conception of the divisions of science and of their relation to the

mind of man than was possible to the ancients like plato he has a vision of

the unity of knowledge not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a

study of elementary mathematics but as the faroff result of the working of

many minds in many ages he is aware that mathematical studies are preliminary

to almost every other at the same time he will not reduce all varieties of

knowledge to the type of mathematics he too must have a nobility of character

without which genius loses the better half of greatness regarding the world as

a point in immensity and each individual as a link in a neverending chain of

existence he will not think much of his own life or be greatly afraid of

death




adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the socratic reasoning thus

showing that plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method he brings

the accusation against himself which might be brought against him by a modern

logicianthat he extracts the answer because he knows how to put the

question in a long argument words are apt to change their meaning slightly or

premises may be assumed or conclusions inferred with rather too much certainty

or universality the variation at each step may be unobserved and yet at last

the divergence becomes considerable hence the failure of attempts to apply

arithmetical or algebraic formulae to logic the imperfection or rather the

higher and more elastic nature of language does not allow words to have the

precision of numbers or of symbols and this quality in language impairs the

force of an argument which has many steps




the objection though fairly met by socrates in this particular instance may

be regarded as implying a reflection upon the socratic mode of reasoning and

here as elsewhere plato seems to intimate that the time had come when the

negative and interrogative method of socrates must be superseded by a positive

and constructive one of which examples are given in some of the later

dialogues adeimantus further argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with

facts for experience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues

contrary to all expectation socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth

of this and explains the anomaly in an allegory first characteristically

depreciating his own inventive powers in this allegory the people are

distinguished from the professional politicians and as elsewhere are spoken

of in a tone of pity rather than of censure under the image of the noble

captain who is not very quick in his perceptions




the uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that mankind

will not use them the world in all ages has been divided between contempt and

fear of those who employ the power of ideas and know no other weapons

concerning the false philosopher socrates argues that the best is most liable

to corruption and that the finer nature is more likely to suffer from alien

conditions we too observe that there are some kinds of excellence which spring

from a peculiar delicacy of constitution as is evidently true of the poetical

and imaginative temperament which often seems to depend on impressions and

hence can only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere the man of genius has

greater pains and greater pleasures greater powers and greater weaknesses and

often a greater play of character than is to be found in ordinary men he can

assume the disguise of virtue or disinterestedness without having them or veil

personal enmity in the language of patriotism and philosophyhe can say

the word which all men are thinking he has an insight which is terrible into

the follies and weaknesses of his fellowmen an alcibiades a mirabeau or a

napoleon the first are born either to be the authors of great evils in states

or of great good when they are drawn in that direction




yet the thesis corruptio optimi pessima cannot be maintained

generally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is corrupted the

alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature may be the elements of

culture to another in general a man can only receive his highest development

in a congenial state or family among friends or fellowworkers but also he

may sometimes be stirred by adverse circumstances to such a degree that he

rises up against them and reforms them and while weaker or coarser characters

will extract good out of evil say in a corrupt state of the church or of

society and live on happily allowing the evil to remain the finer or

stronger natures may be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influencesmay

become misanthrope and philanthrope by turns or in a few instances like the

founders of the monastic orders or the reformers owing to some peculiarity in

themselves or in their age may break away entirely from the world and from the

church sometimes into great good sometimes into great evil sometimes into

both and the same holds in the lesser sphere of a convent a school a family




plato would have us consider how easily the best natures are overpowered by

public opinion and what efforts the rest of mankind will make to get

possession of them the world the church their own profession any political

or party organization are always carrying them off their legs and teaching

them to apply high and holy names to their own prejudices and interests the

monster corporation to which they belong judges right and truth

to be the pleasure of the community the individual becomes one with his order

or if he resists the world is too much for him and will sooner or later be

revenged on him this is perhaps a onesided but not wholly untrue picture of

the maxims and practice of mankind when they sit down together at an

assembly either in ancient or modern times




when the higher natures are corrupted by politics the lower take possession of

the vacant place of philosophy this is described in one of those continuous

images in which the argument to use a platonic expression veils

herself and which is dropped and reappears at intervals the question

is askedwhy are the citizens of states so hostile to philosophy the

answer is that they do not know her and yet there is also a better mind of

the many they would believe if they were taught but hitherto they have only

known a conventional imitation of philosophy words without thoughts systems

which have no life in them a divine person uttering the words of beauty and

freedom the friend of man holding communion with the eternal and seeking to

frame the state in that image they have never known the same double feeling

respecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men the first thought

is that the people are the enemies of truth and right the second that this

only arises out of an accidental error and confusion and that they do not

really hate those who love them if they could be educated to know them




in the latter part of the sixth book three questions have to be considered

st the nature of the longer and more circuitous way which is contrasted with

the shorter and more imperfect method of book iv nd the heavenly pattern or

idea of the state rd the relation of the divisions of knowledge to one

another and to the corresponding faculties of the soul




 of the higher method of knowledge in plato we have only a glimpse neither

here nor in the phaedrus or symposium nor yet in the philebus or sophist does

he give any clear explanation of his meaning he would probably have described

his method as proceeding by regular steps to a system of universal knowledge

which inferred the parts from the whole rather than the whole from the parts

this ideal logic is not practised by him in the search after justice or in the

analysis of the parts of the soul there like aristotle in the nicomachean

ethics he argues from experience and the common use of language but at the

end of the sixth book he conceives another and more perfect method in which

all ideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought forming a connected

whole which is selfsupporting and in which consistency is the test of truth

he does not explain to us in detail the nature of the process like many other

thinkers both in ancient and modern times his mind seems to be filled with a

vacant form which he is unable to realize he supposes the sciences to have a

natural order and connexion in an age when they can hardly be said to exist he

is hastening on to the end of the intellectual world without even

making a beginning of them




in modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of acquiring

knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute knowledge in all

science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in various proportions the a

priori part is that which is derived from the most universal experience of men

or is universally accepted by them the a posteriori is that which grows up

around the more general principles and becomes imperceptibly one with them but

plato erroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis

and that the method of science can anticipate science in entertaining such a

vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified or at least his

meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts of descartes

kant hegel and even of bacon himself in modern philosophy anticipations or

divinations or prophetic glimpses of truths whether concerning man or nature

seem to stand in the same relation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear

to modern inductive science these guesses at truth were not made

at random they arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first

principles in nature which the genius of the greek contemplating the expanse

of heaven and earth seemed to recognize in the distance nor can we deny that

in ancient times knowledge must have stood still and the human mind been

deprived of the very instruments of thought if philosophy had been strictly

confined to the results of experience




 plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist will fill

in the lineaments of the ideal state is this a pattern laid up in heaven or

mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with wondering eye the answer is

that such ideals are framed partly by the omission of particulars partly by

imagination perfecting the form which experience supplies phaedo plato

represents these ideals in a figure as belonging to another world and in

modern times the idea will sometimes seem to precede at other times to

cooperate with the hand of the artist as in science so also in creative art

there is a synthetical as well as an analytical method one man will have the

whole in his mind before he begins to another the processes of mind and hand

will be simultaneous




 there is no difficulty in seeing that platos divisions of knowledge

are based first on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and intellectual

which pervades the whole presocratic philosophy in which is implied also the

opposition of the permanent and transient of the universal and particular but

the age of philosophy in which he lived seemed to require a further

distinctionnumbers and figures were beginning to separate from ideas

the world could no longer regard justice as a cube and was learning to see

though imperfectly that the abstractions of sense were distinct from the

abstractions of mind between the eleatic being or essence and the shadows of

phenomena the pythagorean principle of number found a place and was as

aristotle remarks a conducting medium from one to the other hence plato is

led to introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme of

his philosophy he had observed the use of mathematics in education they were

the best preparation for higher studies the subjective relation between them

further suggested an objective one although the passage from one to the other

is really imaginary metaph for metaphysical and moral philosophy has no

connexion with mathematics number and figure are the abstractions of time and

space not the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions when divested of

metaphor a straight line or a square has no more to do with right and justice

than a crooked line with vice the figurative association was mistaken for a

real one and thus the three latter divisions of the platonic proportion were

constructed




there is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first term of

the series which is nowhere else mentioned and has no reference to any other

part of his system nor indeed does the relation of shadows to objects

correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas probably plato has been led by

the love of analogy timaeus to make four terms instead of three although the

objects perceived in both divisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of

sense he is also preparing the way as his manner is for the shadows of

images at the beginning of the seventh book and the imitation of an imitation

in the tenth the line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity and

is divided into two unequal parts and subdivided into two more each lower

sphere is the multiplication of the preceding of the four faculties faith in

the lower division has an intermediate position cp for the use of the word

faith or belief greek timaeus contrasting equally with the vagueness of

the perception of shadows greek and the higher certainty of understanding

greek and reason greek




the difference between understanding and mind or reason greek is analogous to

the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts and the contemplation

of the whole true knowledge is a whole and is at rest consistency and

universality are the tests of truth to this selfevidencing knowledge of the

whole the faculty of mind is supposed to correspond but there is a knowledge

of the understanding which is incomplete and in motion always because unable

to rest in the subordinate ideas those ideas are called both images and

hypothesesimages because they are clothed in sense hypotheses because

they are assumptions only until they are brought into connexion with the idea

of good




the general meaning of the passage noble then is the bond which links

together sightand of this kind i spoke as the intelligible so far

as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into the terms of

modern philosophy may be described or explained as followsthere is a

truth one and selfexistent to which by the help of a ladder let down from

above the human intelligence may ascend this unity is like the sun in the

heavens the light by which all things are seen the being by which they are

created and sustained it is the idea of good and the steps of the ladder

leading up to this highest or universal existence are the mathematical

sciences which also contain in themselves an element of the universal these

too we see in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good they

then cease to be hypotheses or pictures and become essential parts of a higher

truth which is at once their first principle and their final cause




we cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage but we may

trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are common to us and

to plato such as  the unity and correlation of the sciences or rather of

science for in platos time they were not yet parted off or

distinguished  the existence of a divine power or life or idea or cause or

reason not yet conceived or no longer conceived as in the timaeus and

elsewhere under the form of a person  the recognition of the hypothetical

and conditional character of the mathematical sciences and in a measure of

every science when isolated from the rest  the conviction of a truth which

is invisible and of a law though hardly a law of nature which permeates the

intellectual rather than the visible world




the method of socrates is hesitating and tentative awaiting the fuller

explanation of the idea of good and of the nature of dialectic in the seventh

book the imperfect intelligence of glaucon and the reluctance of socrates to

make a beginning mark the difficulty of the subject the allusion to

theages bridle and to the internal oracle or demonic sign of

socrates which here as always in plato is only prohibitory the remark that

the salvation of any remnant of good in the present evil state of the world is

due to god only the reference to a future state of existence which is unknown

to glaucon in the tenth book and in which the discussions of socrates and his

disciples would be resumed the surprise in the answers the fanciful irony of

socrates where he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of

the philosopher in a figure of speech the original observation that the

sophists after all are only the representatives and not the leaders of public

opinion the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the shower of sleet

under a wall the figure of the great beast followed by the

expression of goodwill towards the common people who would not have rejected

the philosopher if they had known him the right noble thought

that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness the hesitation of

socrates in returning once more to his wellworn theme of the idea of good the

ludicrous earnestness of glaucon the comparison of philosophy to a deserted

maiden who marries beneath herare some of the most interesting

characteristics of the sixth book




yet a few more words may be added on the old theme which was so oft discussed

in the socratic circle of which we like glaucon and adeimantus would fain

if possible have a clearer notion like them we are dissatisfied when we are

told that the idea of good can only be revealed to a student of the

mathematical sciences and we are inclined to think that neither we nor they

could have been led along that path to any satisfactory goal for we have

learned that differences of quantity cannot pass into differences of quality

and that the mathematical sciences can never rise above themselves into the

sphere of our higher thoughts although they may sometimes furnish symbols and

expressions of them and may train the mind in habits of abstraction and

selfconcentration the illusion which was natural to an ancient philosopher

has ceased to be an illusion to us but if the process by which we are supposed

to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary may not the idea itself be

also a mere abstraction we remark first that in all ages and especially in

primitive philosophy words such as being essence unity good have exerted

an extraordinary influence over the minds of men the meagreness or

negativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their power they

have become the forms under which all things were comprehended there was a

need or instinct in the human soul which they satisfied they were not ideas

but gods and to this new mythology the men of a later generation began to

attach the powers and associations of the elder deities




the idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought which were

beginning to take the place of the old mythology it meant unity in which all

time and all existence were gathered up it was the truth of all things and

also the light in which they shone forth and became evident to intelligences

human and divine it was the cause of all things the power by which they were

brought into being it was the universal reason divested of a human

personality it was the life as well as the light of the world all knowledge

and all power were comprehended in it the way to it was through the

mathematical sciences and these too were dependent on it to ask whether god

was the maker of it or made by it would be like asking whether god could be

conceived apart from goodness or goodness apart from god the god of the

timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good they are aspects of

the same differing only as the personal from the impersonal or the masculine

from the neuter the one being the expression or language of mythology the

other of philosophy




this or something like this is the meaning of the idea of good as conceived

by plato ideas of number order harmony development may also be said to

enter into it the paraphrase which has just been given of it goes beyond the

actual words of plato we have perhaps arrived at the stage of philosophy which

enables us to understand what he is aiming at better than he did himself we

are beginning to realize what he saw darkly and at a distance but if he could

have been told that this or some conception of the same kind but higher than

this was the truth at which he was aiming and the need which he sought to

supply he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his own

thoughts than he himself knew as his words are few and his manner reticent and

tentative so must the style of his interpreter be we should not approach his

meaning more nearly by attempting to define it further in translating him into

the language of modern thought we might insensibly lose the spirit of ancient

philosophy it is remarkable that although plato speaks of the idea of good as

the first principle of truth and being it is nowhere mentioned in his writings

except in this passage nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of his

disciples in a later generation it was probably unintelligible to them nor

does the mention of it in aristotle appear to have any reference to this or any

other passage in his extant writings




book vii and now i will describe in a figure the enlightenment or

unenlightenment of our natureimagine human beings living in an

underground den which is open towards the light they have been there from

childhood having their necks and legs chained and can only see into the den

at a distance there is a fire and between the fire and the prisoners a raised

way and a low wall is built along the way like the screen over which

marionette players show their puppets behind the wall appear moving figures

who hold in their hands various works of art and among them images of men and

animals wood and stone and some of the passersby are talking and others

silent a strange parable he said and strange

captives they are ourselves i replied and they see only the shadows

of the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den to these they give

names and if we add an echo which returns from the wall the voices of the

passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows suppose now that you suddenly

turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the

real images will they believe them to be real will not their eyes be dazzled

and will they not try to get away from the light to something which they are

able to behold without blinking and suppose further that they are dragged up

a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself will not their

sight be darkened with the excess of light some time will pass before they get

the habit of perceiving at all and at first they will be able to perceive only

shadows and reflections in the water then they will recognize the moon and the

stars and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is last

of all they will concludethis is he who gives us the year and the

seasons and is the author of all that we see how will they rejoice in passing

from darkness to light how worthless to them will seem the honours and glories

of the den but now imagine further that they descend into their old

habitationsin that underground dwelling they will not see as well as

their fellows and will not be able to compete with them in the measurement of

the shadows on the wall there will be many jokes about the man who went on a

visit to the sun and lost his eyes and if they find anybody trying to set free

and enlighten one of their number they will put him to death if they can

catch him now the cave or den is the world of sight the fire is the sun the

way upwards is the way to knowledge and in the world of knowledge the idea of

good is last seen and with difficulty but when seen is inferred to be the

author of good and rightparent of the lord of light in this world and

of truth and understanding in the other he who attains to the beatific vision

is always going upwards he is unwilling to descend into political assemblies

and courts of law for his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of

images which they behold in themhe cannot enter into the ideas of those

who have never in their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the

substance but blindness is of two kinds and may be caused either by passing

out of darkness into light or out of light into darkness and a man of sense

will distinguish between them and will not laugh equally at both of them but

the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will deem blessed and pity

the other or if he laugh at the puzzled soul looking at the sun he will have

more reason to laugh than the inhabitants of the den at those who descend from

above there is a further lesson taught by this parable of ours some persons

fancy that instruction is like giving eyes to the blind but we say that the

faculty of sight was always there and that the soul only requires to be turned

round towards the light and this is conversion other virtues are almost like

bodily habits and may be acquired in the same manner but intelligence has a

diviner life and is indestructible turning either to good or evil according

to the direction given did you never observe how the mind of a clever rogue

peers out of his eyes and the more clearly he sees the more evil he does now

if you take such an one and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure

and desire which bind his soul to earth his intelligence will be turned round

and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends and

have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no

fixed rule of life nor so overeducated as to be unwilling to leave their

paradise for the business of the world we must choose out therefore the

natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and knowledge of the good

but we must not allow them to remain in the region of light they must be

forced down again among the captives in the den to partake of their labours and

honours will they not think this a hardship you should remember

that our purpose in framing the state was not that our citizens should do what

they like but that they should serve the state for the common good of all may

we not fairly say to our philosopherfriend we do you no wrong for in

other states philosophy grows wild and a wild plant owes nothing to the

gardener but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and kings of our

hive and therefore we must insist on your descending into the den you must

each of you take your turn and become able to use your eyes in the dark and

with a little practice you will see far better than those who quarrel about the

shadows whose knowledge is a dream only whilst yours is a waking reality it

may be that the saint or philosopher who is best fitted may also be the least

inclined to rule but necessity is laid upon him and he must no longer live in

the heaven of ideas and this will be the salvation of the state for those who

rule must not be those who are desirous to rule and if you can offer to our

citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is there will be a chance

that the rich not only in this worlds goods but in virtue and wisdom

may bear rule and the only life which is better than the life of political

ambition is that of philosophy which is also the best preparation for the

government of a state




then now comes the questionhow shall we create our rulers what way is

there from darkness to light the change is effected by philosophy it is not

the turning over of an oystershell but the conversion of a soul from night to

day from becoming to being and what training will draw the soul upwards our

former education had two branches gymnastic which was occupied with the body

and music the sister art which infused a natural harmony into mind and

literature but neither of these sciences gave any promise of doing what we

want nothing remains to us but that universal or primary science of which all

the arts and sciences are partakers i mean number or calculation very

true including the art of war yes certainly then there

is something ludicrous about palamedes in the tragedy coming in and saying

that he had invented number and had counted the ranks and set them in order

for if agamemnon could not count his feet and without number how could he he

must have been a pretty sort of general indeed no man should be a soldier who

cannot count and indeed he is hardly to be called a man but i am not speaking

of these practical applications of arithmetic for number in my view is

rather to be regarded as a conductor to thought and being i will explain what

i mean by the last expressionthings sensible are of two kinds the one

class invite or stimulate the mind while in the other the mind acquiesces now

the stimulating class are the things which suggest contrast and relation for

example suppose that i hold up to the eyes three fingersa fore finger

a middle finger a little fingerthe sight equally recognizes all three

fingers but without number cannot further distinguish them or again suppose

two objects to be relatively great and small these ideas of greatness and

smallness are supplied not by the sense but by the mind and the perception of

their contrast or relation quickens and sets in motion the mind which is

puzzled by the confused intimations of sense and has recourse to number in

order to find out whether the things indicated are one or more than one number

replies that they are two and not one and are to be distinguished from one

another again the sight beholds great and small but only in a confused

chaos and not until they are distinguished does the question arise of their

respective natures we are thus led on to the distinction between the visible

and intelligible that was what i meant when i spoke of stimulants to the

intellect i was thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception the

idea of unity for example like that of a finger does not arouse thought

unless involving some conception of plurality but when the one is also the

opposite of one the contradiction gives rise to reflection an example of this

is afforded by any object of sight all number has also an elevating effect it

raises the mind out of the foam and flux of generation to the contemplation of

being having lesser military and retail uses also the retail use is not

required by us but as our guardian is to be a soldier as well as a

philosopher the military one may be retained and to our higher purpose no

science can be better adapted but it must be pursued in the spirit of a

philosopher not of a shopkeeper it is concerned not with visible objects

but with abstract truth for numbers are pure abstractionsthe true

arithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division when you

divide he insists that you are only multiplying his one is not

material or resolvable into fractions but an unvarying and absolute equality

and this proves the purely intellectual character of his study note also the

great power which arithmetic has of sharpening the wits no other discipline is

equally severe or an equal test of general ability or equally improving to a

stupid person




let our second branch of education be geometry i can easily see

replied glaucon that the skill of the general will be doubled by his

knowledge of geometry that is a small matter the use of geometry to

which i refer is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of the idea

of good and the compelling the mind to look at true being and not at

generation only yet the present mode of pursuing these studies as any one who

is the least of a mathematician is aware is mean and ridiculous they are made

to look downwards to the arts and not upwards to eternal existence the

geometer is always talking of squaring subtending apposing as if he had in

view action whereas knowledge is the real object of the study it should

elevate the soul and create the mind of philosophy it should raise up what

has fallen down not to speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics and

in the improvement of the faculties




shall we propose as a third branch of our education astronomy very

good replied glaucon the knowledge of the heavens is necessary

at once for husbandry navigation military tactics i like your way of

giving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the world and

there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education is not only useful

information but a purification of the eye of the soul which is better than the

bodily eye for by this alone is truth seen now will you appeal to mankind in

general or to the philosopher or would you prefer to look to yourself only

every man is his own best friend then take a step backward for

we are out of order and insert the third dimension which is of solids after

the second which is of planes and then you may proceed to solids in motion

but solid geometry is not popular and has not the patronage of the state nor

is the use of it fully recognized the difficulty is great and the votaries of

the study are conceited and impatient still the charm of the pursuit wins upon

men and if government would lend a little assistance there might be great

progress made very true replied glaucon but do i

understand you now to begin with plane geometry and to place next geometry of

solids and thirdly astronomy or the motion of solids yes i said my

hastiness has only hindered us




very good and now let us proceed to astronomy about which i am willing

to speak in your lofty strain no one can fail to see that the contemplation of

the heavens draws the soul upwards i am an exception then astronomy

as studied at present appears to me to draw the soul not upwards but

downwards stargazing is just looking up at the ceilingno better a man

may lie on his back on land or on waterhe may look up or look down but

there is no science in that the vision of knowledge of which i speak is seen

not with the eyes but with the mind all the magnificence of the heavens is

but the embroidery of a copy which falls far short of the divine original and

teaches nothing about the absolute harmonies or motions of things their beauty

is like the beauty of figures drawn by the hand of daedalus or any other great

artist which may be used for illustration but no mathematician would seek to

obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical relations how

ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the heavens in which the

imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a disturbing element marring the

symmetry of day and night of months and years of the sun and stars in their

courses only by problems can we place astronomy on a truly scientific basis

let the heavens alone and exert the intellect




still mathematics admit of other applications as the pythagoreans say and we

agree there is a sister science of harmonical motion adapted to the ear as

astronomy is to the eye and there may be other applications also let us

inquire of the pythagoreans about them not forgetting that we have an aim

higher than theirs which is the relation of these sciences to the idea of

good the error which pervades astronomy also pervades harmonics the musicians

put their ears in the place of their minds yes replied glaucon

i like to see them laying their ears alongside of their

neighbours facessome saying thats a new

note others declaring that the two notes are the same yes i

said but you mean the empirics who are always twisting and torturing the

strings of the lyre and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings i am

referring rather to the pythagorean harmonists who are almost equally in

error for they investigate only the numbers of the consonances which are

heard and ascend no higherof the true numerical harmony which is

unheard and is only to be found in problems they have not even a conception

that last he said must be a marvellous thing a

thing i replied which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good




all these sciences are the prelude of the strain and are profitable if they

are regarded in their natural relations to one another i dare say

socrates said glaucon but such a study will be an endless

business what study do you meanof the prelude or what for all

these things are only the prelude and you surely do not suppose that a mere

mathematician is also a dialectician certainly not i have hardly ever

known a mathematician who could reason and yet glaucon is not true

reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the intellectual world

and which was by us compared to the effort of sight when from beholding the

shadows on the wall we arrived at last at the images which gave the shadows

even so the dialectical faculty withdrawing from sense arrives by the pure

intellect at the contemplation of the idea of good and never rests but at the

very end of the intellectual world and the royal road out of the cave into the

light and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to contemplate the

shadows of reality not the shadows of an image onlythis progress and

gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by the help of the mathematical

sciences is the elevation of the soul to the contemplation of the highest

ideal of being




so far i agree with you but now leaving the prelude let us proceed

to the hymn what then is the nature of dialectic and what are the paths

which lead thither dear glaucon you cannot follow me here there can

be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been disciplined in

the previous sciences but that there is a science of absolute truth which is

attained in some way very different from those now practised i am confident

for all other arts or sciences are relative to human needs and opinions and

the mathematical sciences are but a dream or hypothesis of true being and

never analyse their own principles dialectic alone rises to the principle

which is above hypotheses converting and gently leading the eye of the soul

out of the barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world

with the help of the sciences which we have been describingsciences as

they are often termed although they require some other name implying greater

clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our

previous sketch was understanding and so we get four namestwo for

intellect and two for opinionreason or mind understanding faith

perception of shadowswhich make a proportion

beingbecomingintellectopinionand sciencebeliefunderstanding

perception of shadows dialectic may be further described as that science which

defines and explains the essence or being of each nature which distinguishes

and abstracts the good and is ready to do battle against all opponents in the

cause of good to him who is not a dialectician life is but a sleepy dream and

many a man is in his grave before his is well waked up and would you have the

future rulers of your ideal state intelligent beings or stupid as posts

certainly not the latter then you must train them in dialectic

which will teach them to ask and answer questions and is the copingstone of

the sciences




i dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen and the

process of selection may be carried a step furtheras before they must

be constant and valiant goodlooking and of noble manners but now they must

also have natural ability which education will improve that is to say they

must be quick at learning capable of mental toil retentive solid diligent

natures who combine intellectual with moral virtues not lame and onesided

diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind or conversely not a maimed

soul which hates falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the

mire of ignorance not a bastard or feeble person but sound in wind and limb

and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind justice

herself can find no fault with natures such as these and they will be the

saviours of our state disciples of another sort would only make philosophy

more ridiculous than she is at present forgive my enthusiasm i am becoming

excited but when i see her trampled underfoot i am angry at the authors of

her disgrace i did not notice that you were more excited than you ought

to have been but i felt that i was now do not let us forget another

point in the selection of our disciplesthat they must be young and not

old for solon is mistaken in saying that an old man can be always learning

youth is the time of study and here we must remember that the mind is free and

dainty and unlike the body must not be made to work against the grain

learning should be at first a sort of play in which the natural bent is

detected as in training them for war the young dogs should at first only

taste blood but when the necessary gymnastics are over which during two or

three years divide life between sleep and bodily exercise then the education

of the soul will become a more serious matter at twenty years of age a

selection must be made of the more promising disciples with whom a new epoch

of education will begin the sciences which they have hitherto learned in

fragments will now be brought into relation with each other and with true

being for the power of combining them is the test of speculative and

dialectical ability and afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made

of those who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction

of ideas but at this point judging from present experience there is a danger

that dialectic may be the source of many evils the danger may be illustrated

by a parallel caseimagine a person who has been brought up in wealth

and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers and who is suddenly informed that he is

a supposititious son he has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and

disregarded the flatterers and now he does the reverse this is just what

happens with a mans principles there are certain doctrines which he

learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority over him presently he

finds that imputations are cast upon them a troublesome querist comes and

asks what is the just and good or proves that virtue is vice

and vice virtue and his mind becomes unsettled and he ceases to love honour

and obey them as he has hitherto done he is seduced into the life of pleasure

and becomes a lawless person and a rogue the case of such speculators is very

pitiable and in order that our thirty years old pupils may not require

this pity let us take every possible care that young persons do not study

philosophy too early for a young man is a sort of puppy who only plays with an

argument and is reasoned into and out of his opinions every day he soon

begins to believe nothing and brings himself and philosophy into discredit a

man of thirty does not run on in this way he will argue and not merely

contradict and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct

what time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of the

soulsay twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body six

or perhaps five years to commence at thirty and then for fifteen years let

the student go down into the den and command armies and gain experience of

life at fifty let him return to the end of all things and have his eyes

uplifted to the idea of good and order his life after that pattern if

necessary taking his turn at the helm of state and training up others to be

his successors when his time comes he shall depart in peace to the islands of

the blest he shall be honoured with sacrifices and receive such worship as

the pythian oracle approves




you are a statuary socrates and have made a perfect image of our

governors yes and of our governesses for the women will share in all

things with the men and you will admit that our state is not a mere

aspiration but may really come into being when there shall arise

philosopherkings one or more who will despise earthly vanities and will be

the servants of justice only and how will they begin their work

their first act will be to send away into the country all those who are more

than ten years of age and to proceed with those who are left




at the commencement of the sixth book plato anticipated his explanation of the

relation of the philosopher to the world in an allegory in this as in other

passages following the order which he prescribes in education and proceeding

from the concrete to the abstract at the commencement of book vii under the

figure of a cave having an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true

light he returns to view the divisions of knowledge exhibiting familiarly as

in a picture the result which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought

in the previous discussion at the same time casting a glance onward at the

dialectical process which is represented by the way leading from darkness to

light the shadows the images the reflection of the sun and stars in the

water the stars and sun themselves severally correspondthe first to

the realm of fancy and poetrythe second to the world of

sensethe third to the abstractions or universals of sense of which

the mathematical sciences furnish the typethe fourth and last to the

same abstractions when seen in the unity of the idea from which they derive a

new meaning and power the true dialectical process begins with the

contemplation of the real stars and not mere reflections of them and ends

with the recognition of the sun or idea of good as the parent not only of

light but of warmth and growth to the divisions of knowledge the stages of

education partly answerfirst there is the early education of childhood

and youth in the fancies of the poets and in the laws and customs of the

statethen there is the training of the body to be a warrior athlete

and a good servant of the mindand thirdly after an interval follows

the education of later life which begins with mathematics and proceeds to

philosophy in general




there seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of platofirst to

realize abstractions secondly to connect them according to him the true

education is that which draws men from becoming to being and to a

comprehensive survey of all being he desires to develop in the human mind the

faculty of seeing the universal in all things until at last the particulars of

sense drop away and the universal alone remains he then seeks to combine the

universals which he has disengaged from sense not perceiving that the

correlation of them has no other basis but the common use of language he never

understands that abstractions as hegel says are mere

abstractionsof use when employed in the arrangement of facts but

adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart from them or with

reference to an imaginary idea of good still the exercise of the faculty of

abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the mind and played a great part in

the education of the human race plato appreciated the value of this faculty

and saw that it might be quickened by the study of number and relation all

things in which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of reflection

the mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind but when

sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished then philosophy begins

the science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions the follow in order

the other sciences of plain and solid geometry and of solids in motion one

branch of which is astronomy or the harmony of the spheresto this is

appended the sister science of the harmony of sounds plato seems also to hint

at the possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical

proportions such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy such as the

pythagoreans and even aristotle make use of in ethics and politics eg his

distinction between arithmetical and geometrical proportion in the ethics book

v or between numerical and proportional equality in the politics




the modern mathematician will readily sympathise with platos delight in

the properties of pure mathematics he will not be disinclined to say with

himlet alone the heavens and study the beauties of number and figure

in themselves he too will be apt to depreciate their application to the arts

he will observe that plato has a conception of geometry in which figures are

to be dispensed with thus in a distant and shadowy way seeming to anticipate

the possibility of working geometrical problems by a more general mode of

analysis he will remark with interest on the backward state of solid geometry

which alas was not encouraged by the aid of the state in the age of plato

and he will recognize the grasp of platos mind in his ability to

conceive of one science of solids in motion including the earth as well as the

heavensnot forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has

been already made that besides astronomy and harmonics the science of solids

in motion may have other applications still more will he be struck with the

comprehensiveness of view which led plato at a time when these sciences hardly

existed to say that they must be studied in relation to one another and to

the idea of good or common principle of truth and being but he will also see

and perhaps without surprise that in that stage of physical and mathematical

knowledge plato has fallen into the error of supposing that he can construct

the heavens a priori by mathematical problems and determine the principles of

harmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear the illusion

was a natural one in that age and country the simplicity and certainty of

astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the variation and complexity of

the world of sense hence the circumstance that there was some elementary basis

of fact some measurement of distance or time or vibrations on which they must

ultimately rest was overlooked by him the modern predecessors of newton fell

into errors equally great and plato can hardly be said to have been very far

wrong or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the subject when we

consider that the greater part of astronomy at the present day consists of

abstract dynamics by the help of which most astronomical discoveries have been

made




the metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes mathematics as

an instrument of educationwhich strengthens the power of attention

developes the sense of order and the faculty of construction and enables the

mind to grasp under simple formulae the quantitative differences of physical

phenomena but while acknowledging their value in education he sees also that

they have no connexion with our higher moral and intellectual ideas in the

attempt which plato makes to connect them we easily trace the influences of

ancient pythagorean notions there is no reason to suppose that he is speaking

of the ideal numbers but he is describing numbers which are pure abstractions

to which he assigns a real and separate existence which as the

teachers of the art meaning probably the pythagoreans would have

affirmed repel all attempts at subdivision and in which unity and every other

number are conceived of as absolute the truth and certainty of numbers when

thus disengaged from phenomena gave them a kind of sacredness in the eyes of

an ancient philosopher nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and

fixedness may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men

who in the words of the timaeus might learn to regulate

their erring lives according to them it is worthy of remark that the

old pythagorean ethical symbols still exist as figures of speech among

ourselves and those who in modern times see the world pervaded by universal

law may also see an anticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the

platonic idea of good which is the source and measure of all things and yet

only an abstraction philebus




two passages seem to require more particular explanations first that which

relates to the analysis of vision the difficulty in this passage may be

explained like many others from differences in the modes of conception

prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers to us the perceptions of sense

are inseparable from the act of the mind which accompanies them the

consciousness of form colour distance is indistinguishable from the simple

sensation which is the medium of them whereas to plato sense is the

heraclitean flux of sense not the vision of objects in the order in which they

actually present themselves to the experienced sight but as they may be

imagined to appear confused and blurred to the halfawakened eye of the infant

the first action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this

chaos and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under which the

confused impressions of sense may be arranged hence arises the question

what is great what is small and thus begins the distinction of

the visible and the intelligible




the second difficulty relates to platos conception of harmonics three

classes of harmonists are distinguished by himfirst the pythagoreans

whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion on music he was to

consult damonthey are acknowledged to be masters in the art but are

altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher import and relation to the

good secondly the mere empirics whom glaucon appears to confuse with them

and whom both he and socrates ludicrously describe as experimenting by mere

auscultation on the intervals of sounds both of these fall short in different

degrees of the platonic idea of harmony which must be studied in a purely

abstract way first by the method of problems and secondly as a part of

universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good




the allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning the den or

cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law compare the description

of the philosopher and lawyer in the theaetetus and the light of the eternal

ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing influence on the minds of those who

return to this lower world in other words their principles are too wide for

practical application they are looking far away into the past and future when

their business is with the present the ideal is not easily reduced to the

conditions of actual life and may often be at variance with them and at

first those who return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den

in the measurement of the shadows and are derided and persecuted by them but

after a while they see the things below in far truer proportions than those who

have never ascended into the upper world the difference between the politician

turned into a philosopher and the philosopher turned into a politician is

symbolized by the two kinds of disordered eyesight the one which is

experienced by the captive who is transferred from darkness to day the other

of the heavenly messenger who voluntarily for the good of his fellowmen

descends into the den in what way the brighter light is to dawn on the

inhabitants of the lower world or how the idea of good is to become the

guiding principle of politics is left unexplained by plato like the nature

and divisions of dialectic of which glaucon impatiently demands to be

informed perhaps he would have said that the explanation could not be given

except to a disciple of the previous sciences symposium




many illustrations of this part of the republic may be found in modern politics

and in daily life for among ourselves too there have been two sorts of

politicians or statesmen whose eyesight has become disordered in two different

ways first there have been great men who in the language of burke

have been too much given to general maxims who like js mill

or burke himself have been theorists or philosophers before they were

politicians or who having been students of history have allowed some great

historical parallel such as the english revolution of  or possibly

athenian democracy or roman imperialism to be the medium through which they

viewed contemporary events or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some

existing institution may have darkened their vision the church of the future

the commonwealth of the future the society of the future have so absorbed

their minds that they are unable to see in their true proportions the politics

of today they have been intoxicated with great ideas such as liberty or

equality or the greatest happiness of the greatest number or the brotherhood

of humanity and they no longer care to consider how these ideas must be

limited in practice or harmonized with the conditions of human life they are

full of light but the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or

blindness almost every one has known some enthusiastic halfeducated person

who sees everything at false distances and in erroneous proportions




with this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted anotherof those who see

not far into the distance but what is near only who have been engaged all

their lives in a trade or a profession who are limited to a set or sect of

their own men of this kind have no universal except their own interests or the

interests of their class no principle but the opinion of persons like

themselves no knowledge of affairs beyond what they pick up in the streets or

at their club suppose them to be sent into a larger world to undertake some

higher calling from being tradesmen to turn generals or politicians from

being schoolmasters to become philosophersor imagine them on a sudden

to receive an inward light which reveals to them for the first time in their

lives a higher idea of god and the existence of a spiritual world by this

sudden conversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset and on

the other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses still

adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more comprehensive view of

human things from familiar examples like these we may learn what plato meant

by the eyesight which is liable to two kinds of disorders




nor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young athenian in

the fifth century before christ who became unsettled by new ideas and the

student of a modern university who has been the subject of a similar

aufklrung we too observe that when young men begin to criticise

customary beliefs or to analyse the constitution of human nature they are apt

to lose hold of solid principle  

 

 they are like trees

which have been frequently transplanted the earth about them is loose and

they have no roots reaching far into the soil they light upon every

flower following their own wayward wills or because the wind blows

them they catch opinions as diseases are caughtwhen they are in the

air borne hither and thither they speedily fall into beliefs

the opposite of those in which they were brought up they hardly retain the

distinction of right and wrong they seem to think one thing as good as

another they suppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are

playing the game of follow my leader they fall in love at

first sight with paradoxes respecting morality some fancy about art

some novelty or eccentricity in religion and like lovers they are so absorbed

for a time in their new notion that they can think of nothing else the

resolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them more

interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of literature or

science or even than a good life like the youth in the philebus they are

ready to discourse to any one about a new philosophy they are generally the

disciples of some eminent professor or sophist whom they rather imitate than

understand they may be counted happy if in later years they retain some of the

simple truths which they acquired in early education and which they may

perhaps find to be worth all the rest such is the picture which plato draws

and which we only reproduce partly in his own words of the dangers which

beset youth in times of transition when old opinions are fading away and the

new are not yet firmly established their condition is ingeniously compared by

him to that of a supposititious son who has made the discovery that his

reputed parents are not his real ones and in consequence they have lost

their authority over him




the distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also

noticeable plato is very well aware that the faculty of the mathematician is

quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense which recognizes and

combines first principles the contempt which he expresses for distinctions of

words the danger of involuntary falsehood the apology which socrates makes

for his earnestness of speech are highly characteristic of the platonic style

and mode of thought the quaint notion that if palamedes was the inventor of

number agamemnon could not have counted his feet the art by which we are made

to believe that this state of ours is not a dream only the gravity with which

the first step is taken in the actual creation of the state namely the

sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of age in order to

expedite the business of education by a generation are also truly platonic

for the last compare the passage at the end of the third book in which he

expects the lie about the earthborn men to be believed in the second

generation




book viii and so we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state

wives and children are to be in common and the education and pursuits of men

and women both in war and peace are to be common and kings are to be

philosophers and warriors and the soldiers of the state are to live together

having all things in common and they are to be warrior athletes receiving no

pay but only their food from the other citizens now let us return to the

point at which we digressed that is easily done he replied

you were speaking of the state which you had constructed and of the

individual who answered to this both of whom you affirmed to be good and you

said that of inferior states there were four forms and four individuals

corresponding to them which although deficient in various degrees were all of

them worth inspecting with a view to determining the relative happiness or

misery of the best or worst man then polemarchus and adeimantus interrupted

you and this led to another argumentand so here we are suppose

that we put ourselves again in the same position and do you repeat your

question i should like to know of what constitutions you were

speaking besides the perfect state there are only four of any note in

hellasfirst the famous lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth secondly

oligarchy a state full of evils thirdly democracy which follows next in

order fourthly tyranny which is the disease or death of all government now

states are not made of oak and rock but of flesh and blood and

therefore as there are five states there must be five human natures in

individuals which correspond to them and first there is the ambitious

nature which answers to the lacedaemonian state secondly the oligarchical

nature thirdly the democratical and fourthly the tyrannical this last will

have to be compared with the perfectly just which is the fifth that we may

know which is the happier and then we shall be able to determine whether the

argument of thrasymachus or our own is the more convincing and as before we

began with the state and went on to the individual so now beginning with

timocracy let us go on to the timocratical man and then proceed to the other

forms of government and the individuals who answer to them




but how did timocracy arise out of the perfect state plainly like all changes

of government from division in the rulers but whence came division

sing heavenly muses as homer sayslet them condescend to

answer us as if we were children to whom they put on a solemn face in jest

and what will they say they will say that human things are fated

to decay and even the perfect state will not escape from this law of destiny

when the wheel comes full circle in a period short or long

plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility which the intelligence

of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable them to ascertain and

children will be born out of season for whereas divine creations are in a

perfect cycle or number the human creation is in a number which declines from

perfection and has four terms and three intervals of numbers increasing

waning assimilating dissimilating and yet perfectly commensurate with each

other the base of the number with a fourth added or which is  multiplied

by five and cubed gives two harmoniesthe first a square number which

is a hundred times the base or a hundred times a hundred the second an

oblong being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side

of which is five subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares from

all and adding a hundred cubes of three this entire number is geometrical and

contains the rule or law of generation when this law is neglected marriages

will be unpropitious the inferior offspring who are then born will in time

become the rulers the state will decline and education fall into decay

gymnastic will be preferred to music and the gold and silver and brass and

iron will form a chaotic massthus division will arise such is the

muses answer to our question and a true answer of

coursebut what more have they to say they say that the two

races the iron and brass and the silver and gold will draw the state

different waysthe one will take to trade and moneymaking and the

others having the true riches and not caring for money will resist them the

contest will end in a compromise they will agree to have private property and

will enslave their fellowcitizens who were once their friends and nurturers

but they will retain their warlike character and will be chiefly occupied in

fighting and exercising rule thus arises timocracy which is intermediate

between aristocracy and oligarchy




the new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers and

contempt for trade and having common meals and in devotion to warlike and

gymnastic exercises but corruption has crept into philosophy and simplicity

of character which was once her note is now looked for only in the military

class arts of war begin to prevail over arts of peace the ruler is no longer

a philosopher as in oligarchies there springs up among them an extravagant

love of gainget another mans and save your own is their

principle and they have dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver

for the use of their women and others they take their pleasures by stealth

like boys who are running away from their fatherthe law and their

education is not inspired by the muse but imposed by the strong arm of power

the leading characteristic of this state is party spirit and ambition




and what manner of man answers to such a state in love of

contention replied adeimantus he will be like our friend

glaucon in that respect perhaps but not in others he is

selfasserting and illeducated yet fond of literature although not himself a

speakerfierce with slaves but obedient to rulers a lover of power and

honour which he hopes to gain by deeds of armsfond too of gymnastics

and of hunting as he advances in years he grows avaricious for he has lost

philosophy which is the only saviour and guardian of men his origin is as

followshis father is a good man dwelling in an illordered state who

has retired from politics in order that he may lead a quiet life his mother is

angry at her loss of precedence among other women she is disgusted at her

husbands selfishness and she expatiates to her son on the unmanliness

and indolence of his father the old family servant takes up the tale and says

to the youthwhen you grow up you must be more of a man than your

father all the world are agreed that he who minds his own business is

an idiot while a busybody is highly honoured and esteemed the young man

compares this spirit with his fathers words and ways and as he is

naturally well disposed although he has suffered from evil influences he

rests at a middle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour




and now let us set another city over against another man the next form of

government is oligarchy in which the rule is of the rich only nor is it

difficult to see how such a state arises the decline begins with the

possession of gold and silver illegal modes of expenditure are invented one

draws another on and the multitude are infected riches outweigh virtue

lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour misers of politicians and

in time political privileges are confined by law to the rich who do not

shrink from violence in order to effect their purposes




thus much of the originlet us next consider the evils of oligarchy

would a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because he was

rich or refuse a good one because he was poor and does not the analogy apply

still more to the state and there are yet greater evils two nations are

struggling together in onethe rich and the poor and the rich dare not

put arms into the hands of the poor and are unwilling to pay for defenders out

of their own money and have we not already condemned that state in which the

same persons are warriors as well as shopkeepers the greatest evil of all is

that a man may sell his property and have no place in the state while there is

one class which has enormous wealth the other is entirely destitute but

observe that these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature

in them when they were rich than now that they are poor they were miserable

spendthrifts always they are the drones of the hive only whereas the actual

drone is unprovided by nature with a sting the twolegged things whom we call

drones are some of them without stings and some of them have dreadful stings

in other words there are paupers and there are rogues these are never far

apart and in oligarchical cities where nearly everybody is a pauper who is

not a ruler you will find abundance of both and this evil state of society

originates in bad education and bad government




like state like manthe change in the latter begins with the

representative of timocracy he walks at first in the ways of his father who

may have been a statesman or general perhaps and presently he sees him

fallen from his high estate the victim of informers dying in

prison or exile or by the hand of the executioner the lesson which he thus

receives makes him cautious he leaves politics represses his pride and

saves pence avarice is enthroned as his bosoms lord and assumes the

style of the great king the rational and spirited elements sit humbly on the

ground at either side the one immersed in calculation the other absorbed in

the admiration of wealth the love of honour turns to love of money the

conversion is instantaneous the man is mean saving toiling the slave of one

passion which is the master of the rest is he not the very image of the state

he has had no education or he would never have allowed the blind god of riches

to lead the dance within him and being uneducated he will have many slavish

desires some beggarly some knavish breeding in his soul if he is the

trustee of an orphan and has the power to defraud he will soon prove that he

is not without the will and that his passions are only restrained by fear and

not by reason hence he leads a divided existence in which the better desires

mostly prevail but when he is contending for prizes and other distinctions he

is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren honour in time

of war he fights with a small part of his resources and usually keeps his

money and loses the victory




next comes democracy and the democratic man out of oligarchy and the

oligarchical man insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an oligarchy and

they encourage expensive habits in order that they may gain by the ruin of

extravagant youth thus men of family often lose their property or rights of

citizenship but they remain in the city full of hatred against the new owners

of their estates and ripe for revolution the usurer with stooping walk

pretends not to see them he passes by and leaves his stingthat is his

moneyin some other victim and many a man has to pay the parent or

principal sum multiplied into a family of children and is reduced into a state

of dronage by him the only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit a

man in his use of his property or to insist that he shall lend at his own

risk but the ruling class do not want remedies they care only for money and

are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the citizens now there are

occasions on which the governors and the governed meet togetherat

festivals on a journey voyaging or fighting the sturdy pauper finds that in

the hour of danger he is not despised he sees the rich man puffing and

panting and draws the conclusion which he privately imparts to his

companionsthat our people are not good for much and as a

sickly frame is made ill by a mere touch from without or sometimes without

external impulse is ready to fall to pieces of itself so from the least cause

or with none at all the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death

and democracy comes into power when the poor are the victors killing some and

exiling some and giving equal shares in the government to all the rest




the manner of life in such a state is that of democrats there is freedom and

plainness of speech and every man does what is right in his own eyes and has

his own way of life hence arise the most various developments of character

the state is like a piece of embroidery of which the colours and figures are

the manners of men and there are many who like women and children prefer

this variety to real beauty and excellence the state is not one but many like

a bazaar at which you can buy anything the great charm is that you may do as

you like you may govern if you like let it alone if you like go to war and

make peace if you feel disposed and all quite irrespective of anybody else

when you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same a gentleman is

desired to go into exile and he stalks about the streets like a hero and

nobody sees him or cares for him observe too how grandly democracy sets her

foot upon all our fine theories of educationhow little she cares for

the training of her statesmen the only qualification which she demands is the

profession of patriotism such is democracya pleasing lawless various

sort of government distributing equality to equals and unequals alike




let us now inspect the individual democrat and first as in the case of the

state we will trace his antecedents he is the son of a miserly oligarch and

has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary pleasures perhaps i

ought to explain this latter termnecessary pleasures are those which

are good and which we cannot do without unnecessary pleasures are those which

do no good and of which the desire might be eradicated by early training for

example the pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy up to

a certain point beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind and

the excess may be avoided when in excess they may be rightly called expensive

pleasures in opposition to the useful ones and the drone as we called him

is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires whereas the miserly

oligarch is subject only to the necessary




the oligarch changes into the democrat in the following mannerthe youth

who has had a miserly bringing up gets a taste of the drones honey he

meets with wild companions who introduce him to every new pleasure as in the

state so in the individual there are allies on both sides temptations from

without and passions from within there is reason also and external influences

of parents and friends in alliance with the oligarchical principle and the two

factions are in violent conflict with one another sometimes the party of order

prevails but then again new desires and new disorders arise and the whole mob

of passions gets possession of the acropolis that is to say the soul which

they find void and unguarded by true words and works falsehoods and illusions

ascend to take their place the prodigal goes back into the country of the

lotophagi or drones and openly dwells there and if any offer of alliance or

parley of individual elders comes from home the false spirits shut the gates

of the castle and permit no one to enterthere is a battle and they

gain the victory and straightway making alliance with the desires they banish

modesty which they call folly and send temperance over the border when the

house has been swept and garnished they dress up the exiled vices and

crowning them with garlands bring them back under new names insolence they

call good breeding anarchy freedom waste magnificence impudence courage

such is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to

the unnecessary after a while he divides his time impartially between them

and perhaps when he gets older and the violence of passion has abated he

restores some of the exiles and lives in a sort of equilibrium indulging first

one pleasure and then another and if reason comes and tells him that some

pleasures are good and honourable and others bad and vile he shakes his head

and says that he can make no distinction between them thus he lives in the

fancy of the hour sometimes he takes to drink and then he turns abstainer he

practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all then again he would be a

philosopher or a politician or again he would be a warrior or a man of

business he is




every thing by starts and nothing long




there remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all

statestyranny and the tyrant tyranny springs from democracy much as

democracy springs from oligarchy both arise from excess the one from excess

of wealth the other from excess of freedom the great natural good of

life says the democrat is freedom and this exclusive

love of freedom and regardlessness of everything else is the cause of the

change from democracy to tyranny the state demands the strong wine of freedom

and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught punishes and insults them

equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved principle

anarchy is the law not of the state only but of private houses and extends

even to the animals father and son citizen and foreigner teacher and pupil

old and young are all on a level fathers and teachers fear their sons and

pupils and the wisdom of the young man is a match for the elder and the old

imitate the jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being

thought morose slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses and

there is no difference between men and women nay the very animals in a

democratic state have a freedom which is unknown in other places the shedogs

are as good as their shemistresses and horses and asses march along with

dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes in their way that

has often been my experience at last the citizens become so sensitive

that they cannot endure the yoke of laws written or unwritten they would have

no man call himself their master such is the glorious beginning of things out

of which tyranny springs glorious indeed but what is to

follow the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy for there is a

law of contraries the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery and

the greater the freedom the greater the slavery you will remember that in the

oligarchy were found two classesrogues and paupers whom we compared to

drones with and without stings these two classes are to the state what phlegm

and bile are to the human body and the statephysician or legislator must

get rid of them just as the beemaster keeps the drones out of the hive now

in a democracy too there are drones but they are more numerous and more

dangerous than in the oligarchy there they are inert and unpractised here

they are full of life and animation and the keener sort speak and act while

the others buzz about the bema and prevent their opponents from being heard

and there is another class in democratic states of respectable thriving

individuals who can be squeezed when the drones have need of their

possessions there is moreover a third class who are the labourers and the

artisans and they make up the mass of the people when the people meet they

are omnipotent but they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted

by a little honey and the rich are made to supply the honey of which the

demagogues keep the greater part themselves giving a taste only to the mob

their victims attempt to resist they are driven mad by the stings of the

drones and so become downright oligarchs in selfdefence then follow

informations and convictions for treason the people have some protector whom

they nurse into greatness and from this root the tree of tyranny springs the

nature of the change is indicated in the old fable of the temple of zeus

lycaeus which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of

other victims will turn into a wolf even so the protector who tastes human

blood and slays some and exiles others with or without law who hints at

abolition of debts and division of lands must either perish or become a

wolfthat is a tyrant perhaps he is driven out but he soon comes back

from exile and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means they

plot his assassination thereupon the friend of the people makes his wellknown

request to them for a bodyguard which they readily grant thinking only of

his danger and not of their own now let the rich man make to himself wings

for he will never run away again if he does not do so then and the great

protector having crushed all his rivals stands proudly erect in the chariot

of state a fullblown tyrant let us enquire into the nature of his happiness




in the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody he is not

a dominus no not he he has only come to put an end to debt and

the monopoly of land having got rid of foreign enemies he makes himself

necessary to the state by always going to war he is thus enabled to depress

the poor by heavy taxes and so keep them at work and he can get rid of bolder

spirits by handing them over to the enemy then comes unpopularity some of his

old associates have the courage to oppose him the consequence is that he has

to make a purgation of the state but unlike the physician who purges away the

bad he must get rid of the highspirited the wise and the wealthy for he has

no choice between death and a life of shame and dishonour and the more hated

he is the more he will require trusty guards but how will he obtain them

they will come flocking like birdsfor pay will he not

rather obtain them on the spot he will take the slaves from their owners and

make them his bodyguard these are his trusted friends who admire and look up

to him are not the tragic poets wise who magnify and exalt the tyrant and say

that he is wise by association with the wise and are not their praises of

tyranny alone a sufficient reason why we should exclude them from our state

they may go to other cities and gather the mob about them with fine words and

change commonwealths into tyrannies and democracies receiving honours and

rewards for their services but the higher they and their friends ascend

constitution hill the more their honour will fail and become too

asthmatic to mount to return to the tyranthow will he support

that rare army of his first by robbing the temples of their treasures which

will enable him to lighten the taxes then he will take all his fathers

property and spend it on his companions male or female now his father is the

demus and if the demus gets angry and says that a great hulking son ought not

to be a burden on his parents and bids him and his riotous crew begone then

will the parent know what a monster he has been nurturing and that the son

whom he would fain expel is too strong for him you do not mean to say

that he will beat his father yes he will after having taken away his

arms then he is a parricide and a cruel unnatural son and the

people have jumped from the fear of slavery into slavery out of the smoke into

the fire thus liberty when out of all order and reason passes into the worst

form of servitude




in the previous books plato has described the ideal state now he returns to

the perverted or declining forms on which he had lightly touched at the end of

book iv these he describes in a succession of parallels between the

individuals and the states tracing the origin of either in the state or

individual which has preceded them he begins by asking the point at which he

digressed and is thus led shortly to recapitulate the substance of the three

former books which also contain a parallel of the philosopher and the state




of the first decline he gives no intelligible account he would not have liked

to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal state which to us

would appear to be the impracticability of communism or the natural antagonism

of the ruling and subject classes he throws a veil of mystery over the origin

of the decline which he attributes to ignorance of the law of population of

this law the famous geometrical figure or number is the expression like the

ancients in general he had no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of

the education of the human race his ideal was not to be attained in the course

of ages but was to spring in full armour from the head of the legislator when

good laws had been given he thought only of the manner in which they were

likely to be corrupted or of how they might be filled up in detail or restored

in accordance with their original spirit he appears not to have reflected upon

the full meaning of his own words in the brief space of human life

nothing great can be accomplished or again as he afterwards says in

the laws infinite time is the maker of cities the order of

constitutions which is adopted by him represents an order of thought rather

than a succession of time and may be considered as the first attempt to frame

a philosophy of history




the first of these declining states is timocracy or the government of soldiers

and lovers of honour which answers to the spartan state this is a government

of force in which education is not inspired by the muses but imposed by the

law and in which all the finer elements of organization have disappeared the

philosopher himself has lost the love of truth and the soldier who is of a

simpler and honester nature rules in his stead the individual who answers to

timocracy has some noticeable qualities he is described as ill educated but

like the spartan a lover of literature and although he is a harsh master to

his servants he has no natural superiority over them his character is based

upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father who in a troubled city

has retired from politics and his mother who is dissatisfied at her own

position is always urging him towards the life of political ambition such a

character may have had this origin and indeed livy attributes the licinian

laws to a feminine jealousy of a similar kind but there is obviously no

connection between the manner in which the timocratic state springs out of the

ideal and the mere accident by which the timocratic man is the son of a

retired statesman




the two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less historical

foundation for there is no trace in greek history of a polity like the spartan

or cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth or of the oligarchy of wealth

passing into a democracy the order of history appears to be different first

in the homeric times there is the royal or patriarchal form of government

which a century or two later was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than

of wealth and in which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary

possession of land and power sometimes this oligarchical government gave way

to a government based upon a qualification of property which according to

aristotles mode of using words would have been called a timocracy and

this in some cities as at athens became the conducting medium to democracy

but such was not the necessary order of succession in states nor indeed can

any order be discerned in the endless fluctuation of greek history like the

tides in the euripus except perhaps in the almost uniform tendency from

monarchy to aristocracy in the earliest times at first sight there appears to

be a similar inversion in the last step of the platonic succession for

tyranny instead of being the natural end of democracy in early greek history

appears rather as a stage leading to democracy the reign of peisistratus and

his sons is an episode which comes between the legislation of solon and the

constitution of cleisthenes and some secret cause common to them all seems to

have led the greater part of hellas at her first appearance in the dawn of

history eg athens argos corinth sicyon and nearly every state with the

exception of sparta through a similar stage of tyranny which ended either in

oligarchy or democracy but then we must remember that plato is describing

rather the contemporary governments of the sicilian states which alternated

between democracy and tyranny than the ancient history of athens or corinth




the portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later greek delighted to

draw of phalaris and dionysius in which as in the lives of mediaeval saints

or mythic heroes the conduct and actions of one were attributed to another in

order to fill up the outline there was no enormity which the greek was not

today to believe of them the tyrant was the negation of government and law

his assassination was glorious there was no crime however unnatural which

might not with probability be attributed to him in this plato was only

following the common thought of his countrymen which he embellished and

exaggerated with all the power of his genius there is no need to suppose that

he drew from life or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a personal

acquaintance with dionysius the manner in which he speaks of them would rather

tend to render doubtful his ever having consorted with them or

entertained the schemes which are attributed to him in the epistles of

regenerating sicily by their help




plato in a hyperbolical and seriocomic vein exaggerates the follies of

democracy which he also sees reflected in social life to him democracy is a

state of individualism or dissolution in which every one is doing what is

right in his own eyes of a people animated by a common spirit of liberty

rising as one man to repel the persian host which is the leading idea of

democracy in herodotus and thucydides he never seems to think but if he is

not a believer in liberty still less is he a lover of tyranny his deeper and

more serious condemnation is reserved for the tyrant who is the ideal of

wickedness and also of weakness and who in his utter helplessness and

suspiciousness is leading an almost impossible existence without that remnant

of good which in platos opinion was required to give power to evil

book i this ideal of wickedness living in helpless misery is the reverse of

that other portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour

which first of all thrasymachus and afterwards the sons of ariston had drawn

and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the good of his

subjects




each of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical

gradation the ideal state is under the rule of reason not extinguishing but

harmonizing the passions and training them in virtue in the timocracy and the

timocratic man the constitution whether of the state or of the individual is

based first upon courage and secondly upon the love of honour this latter

virtue which is hardly to be esteemed a virtue has superseded all the rest

in the second stage of decline the virtues have altogether disappeared and the

love of gain has succeeded to them in the third stage or democracy the

various passions are allowed to have free play and the virtues and vices are

impartially cultivated but this freedom which leads to many curious

extravagances of character is in reality only a state of weakness and

dissipation at last one monster passion takes possession of the whole nature

of manthis is tyranny in all of them excessthe excess first of

wealth and then of freedom is the element of decay




the eighth book of the republic abounds in pictures of life and fanciful

allusions the use of metaphorical language is carried to a greater extent than

anywhere else in plato we may remark




 the description of the two nations in one which become more and more

divided in the greek republics as in feudal times and perhaps also in our

own




 the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of pythagorean formula as

equality among unequals




 the free and easy ways of men and animals which are characteristic of

liberty as foreign mercenaries and universal mistrust are of the tyrant




 the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a

speculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in modern

times and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern legislation debt and

land were the two great difficulties of the ancient lawgiver in modern times

we may be said to have almost if not quite solved the first of these

difficulties but hardly the second




still more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals there is

the family picture of the father and mother and the old servant of the

timocratical man and the outward respectability and inherent meanness of the

oligarchical the uncontrolled licence and freedom of the democrat in which

the young alcibiades seems to be depicted doing right or wrong as he pleases

and who at last like the prodigal goes into a far country note here the play

of language by which the democratic man is himself represented under the image

of a state having a citadel and receiving embassies and there is the

wildbeast nature which breaks loose in his successor the hit about the

tyrant being a parricide the representation of the tyrants life as an

obscene dream the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than the most

miserable of men in book ix the hint to the poets that if they are the friends

of tyrants there is no place for them in a constitutional state and that they

are too clever not to see the propriety of their own expulsion the continuous

image of the drones who are of two kinds swelling at last into the monster

drone having wings book ixare among platos happiest touches




there remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the

republic the socalled number of the state this is a puzzle almost as great

as the number of the beast in the book of revelation and though apparently

known to aristotle is referred to by cicero as a proverb of obscurity ep ad

att and some have imagined that there is no answer to the puzzle and that

plato has been practising upon his readers but such a deception as this is

inconsistent with the manner in which aristotle speaks of the number pol

and would have been ridiculous to any reader of the republic who was acquainted

with greek mathematics as little reason is there for supposing that plato

intentionally used obscure expressions the obscurity arises from our want of

familiarity with the subject on the other hand plato himself indicates that

he is not altogether serious and in describing his number as a solemn jest of

the muses he appears to imply some degree of satire on the symbolical use of

number compare cratylus protag




our hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an accurate study

of the words themselves on which a faint light is thrown by the parallel

passage in the ninth book another help is the allusion in aristotle who makes

the important remark that the latter part of the passage greek describes a

solid figure polhe only says that nothing is abiding but that

all things change in a certain cycle and that the origin of the change is a

base of numbers which are in the ratio of  and this when combined with a

figure of five gives two harmonies he means when the number of this figure

becomes solid some further clue may be gathered from the appearance of

the pythagorean triangle which is denoted by the numbers    and in

which as in every rightangled triangle the squares of the two lesser sides

equal the square of the hypotenuse     




plato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number tim ie a number

in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole this is the divine or

perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are complete he also

speaks of a human or imperfect number having four terms and three intervals of

numbers which are related to one another in certain proportions these he

converts into figures and finds in them when they have been raised to the

third power certain elements of number which give two harmonies

the one square the other oblong but he does not say that the square number

answers to the divine or the oblong number to the human cycle nor is any

intimation given that the first or divine number represents the period of the

world the second the period of the state or of the human race as zeller

supposes nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned arist the second is

the number of generations or births and presides over them in the same

mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them or in which according

to the pythagoreans opportunity justice marriage are represented by some

number or figure this is probably the number 




the explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up the

number  this explanation derives a certain plausibility from the

circumstance that  is the ancient number of the spartan citizens herod

and would be what plato might have called a number which nearly concerns

the population of a city the mysterious disappearance of the spartan

population may possibly have suggested to him the first cause of his decline of

states the lesser or square harmony of  might be a symbol

of the guardiansthe larger or oblong harmony of the

people and the numbers    might refer respectively to the three orders in

the state or parts of the soul the four virtues the five forms of government

the harmony of the musical scale which is elsewhere used as a symbol of the

harmony of the state is also indicated for the numbers    which

represent the sides of the pythagorean triangle also denote the intervals of

the scale




the terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as follows a

perfect number greek as already stated is one which is equal to the sum of

its divisors thus  which is the first perfect or cyclical number     

 the words greek terms or notes and greek

intervals are applicable to music as well as to number and

figure greek is the base on which the whole calculation

depends or the lowest term from which it can be worked out the

words greek have been variously translatedsquared and

cubed donaldson equalling and equalled in power

weber by involution and evolution ie by raising the power

and extracting the root as in the translation numbers are called like

and unlike greek when the factors or the sides of the planes and cubes

which they represent are or are not in the same ratio eg  and    cubed

and  cubed and conversely waxing greek numbers called also

increasing greek are those which are exceeded by the sum of

their divisors eg  and  are less than  and  waning

greek numbers called also decreasing greek are those which

succeed the sum of their divisors eg  and  exceed  and  the words

translated commensurable and agreeable to one another greek

seem to be different ways of describing the same relation with more or less

precision they are equivalent to expressible in terms having the same

relation to one another like the series     each of which

numbers is in the relation of  and  to the preceding the

base or fundamental number which has  added to

it  and    or a musical fourth greek is a

proportion of numbers as of musical notes applied either to the

parts or factors of a single number or to the relation of one number to

another the first harmony is a square number greek the second

harmony is an oblong number greek ie a number representing a

figure of which the opposite sides only are equal greek  numbers

squared from or upon diameters greek 

rational ie omitting fractions greek

irrational ie including fractions eg  is a square of the

rational diameter of a figure the side of which    of an irrational

diameter of the same for several of the explanations here given and for a good

deal besides i am indebted to an excellent article on the platonic number by

dr donaldson proc of the philol society




the conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as follows

having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle is the number of

the world and the number of the imperfect cycle the number of the state he

proceeds the period of the world is defined by the perfect number 

that of the state by the cube of that number or  which is the product of

the last pair of terms in the platonic tetractys a series of seven terms 

      and if we take this as the basis of our computation we

shall have two cube numbers greek viz  and  and the mean proportionals

between these viz  and  will furnish three intervals and four terms and

these terms and intervals stand related to one another in the sesquialtera

ratio ie each term is to the preceding as  now if we remember that the

number    x    cubed   cubed   cubed and  squared   squared 

 squared we must admit that this number implies the numbers    to which

musicians attach so much importance and if we combine the ratio  with the

number  or multiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse we shall by

first squaring and then cubing obtain two expressions which denote the ratio

of the two last pairs of terms in the platonic tetractys the former multiplied

by the square the latter by the cube of the number  the sum of the first

four digits which constitute the platonic tetractys the two greek he

elsewhere explains as follows the first greek is greek in other

words  x  all squared   x  squared over  squared the second

greek a cube of the same root is described as  multiplied alpha by the

rational diameter of  diminished by unity ie as shown above  beta by

two incommensurable diameters ie the two first irrationals or  and  and

gamma by the cube of  or  thus we have         x 

cubed this second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former

harmony is the square and therefore must be divided by the cube of  in other

words the whole expression will be  for the first harmony  

for the second harmony 




the reasons which have inclined me to agree with dr donaldson and also with

schleiermacher in supposing that  is the platonic number of births are 

that it coincides with the description of the number given in the first part of

the passage greek  that the number  with its permutations would

have been familiar to a greek mathematician though unfamiliar to us  that

 is the cube of  and also the sum of  cubed  cubed  cubed the

numbers    representing the pythagorean triangle of which the sides when

squared equal the square of the hypotenuse       that it is also

the period of the pythagorean metempsychosis  the three ultimate terms or

bases    of which  is composed answer to the third fourth fifth in

the musical scale  that the number  is the product of the cubes of  and

 which are the two last terms in the platonic tetractys  that the

pythagorean triangle is said by plutarch de is et osir proclus super

prima eucl and quintilian de musica to be contained in this passage so

that the tradition of the school seems to point in the same direction  that

the pythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage greek




but though agreeing with dr donaldson thus far i see no reason for supposing

as he does that the first or perfect number is the world the human or

imperfect number the state nor has he given any proof that the second harmony

is a cube nor do i think that greek can mean two

incommensurables which he arbitrarily assumes to be  and  but

rather as the preceding clause implies greek ie two square numbers based

upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is    x 




the greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the words

greek a base of three with a third added to it multiplied by

 in this somewhat forced manner plato introduces once more the numbers

of the pythagorean triangle but the coincidences in the numbers which follow

are in favour of the explanation the first harmony of  as has been already

remarked probably represents the rulers the second and oblong harmony of

 the people




and here we take leave of the difficulty the discovery of the riddle would be

useless and would throw no light on ancient mathematics the point of interest

is that plato should have used such a symbol and that so much of the

pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him his general meaning is that

divine creation is perfect and is represented or presided over by a perfect or

cyclical number human generation is imperfect and represented or presided

over by an imperfect number or series of numbers the number  which is the

number of the citizens in the laws is expressly based by him on utilitarian

grounds namely the convenience of the number for division it is also made up

of the first seven digits multiplied by one another the contrast of the

perfect and imperfect number may have been easily suggested by the corrections

of the cycle which were made first by meton and secondly by callippus the

latter is said to have been a pupil of plato of the degree of importance or

of exactness to be attributed to the problem the number of the tyrant in book

ix    x  and the slight correction of the error in the number

 laws may furnish a criterion there is nothing surprising in the

circumstance that those who were seeking for order in nature and had found

order in number should have imagined one to give law to the other plato

believes in a power of number far beyond what he could see realized in the

world around him and he knows the great influence which the little

matter of    exercises upon education he may even be thought to

have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of quetelet and others that

numbers depend upon numbers egin population the numbers of births

and the respective numbers of children born of either sex on the respective

ages of parents ie on other numbers




book ix last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have to enquire

whence is he and how does he livein happiness or in misery there is

however a previous question of the nature and number of the appetites which i

should like to consider first some of them are unlawful and yet admit of

being chastened and weakened in various degrees by the power of reason and law

what appetites do you mean i mean those which are awake when the

reasoning powers are asleep which get up and walk about naked without any

selfrespect or shame and there is no conceivable folly or crime however

cruel or unnatural of which in imagination they may not be guilty

true he said very true but when a mans

pulse beats temperately and he has supped on a feast of reason and come to a

knowledge of himself before going to rest and has satisfied his desires just

enough to prevent their perturbing his reason which remains clear and

luminous and when he is free from quarrel and heatthe visions which he

has on his bed are least irregular and abnormal even in good men there is such

an irregular wildbeast nature which peers out in sleep




to returnyou remember what was said of the democrat that he was the

son of a miserly father who encouraged the saving desires and repressed the

ornamental and expensive ones presently the youth got into fine company and

began to entertain a dislike to his fathers narrow ways and being a

better man than the corrupters of his youth he came to a mean and led a life

not of lawless or slavish passion but of regular and successive indulgence

now imagine that the youth has become a father and has a son who is exposed to

the same temptations and has companions who lead him into every sort of

iniquity and parents and friends who try to keep him right the counsellors of

evil find that their only chance of retaining him is to implant in his soul a

monster drone or love while other desires buzz around him and mystify him

with sweet sounds and scents this monster love takes possession of him and

puts an end to every true or modest thought or wish love like drunkenness and

madness is a tyranny and the tyrannical man whether made by nature or habit

is just a drinking lusting furious sort of animal




and how does such an one live nay that you must tell me well

then i fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries and love will be

the lord and master of the house many desires require much money and so he

spends all that he has and borrows more and when he has nothing the young

ravens are still in the nest in which they were hatched crying for food love

urges them on and they must be gratified by force or fraud or if not they

become painful and troublesome and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones

so will the son take possession of the goods of his parents if they show signs

of refusing he will defraud and deceive them and if they openly resist what

then i can only say that i should not much like to be in their

place but o heavens adeimantus to think that for some newfangled

and unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother best and

dearest of friends or enslave them to the fancies of the hour truly a

tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother when there is no more to

be got out of them he turns burglar or pickpocket or robs a temple love

overmasters the thoughts of his youth and he becomes in sober reality the

monster that he was sometimes in sleep he waxes strong in all violence and

lawlessness and is ready for any deed of daring that will supply the wants of

his rabblerout in a wellordered state there are only a few such and these

in time of war go out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant but in time of

peace they stay at home and do mischief they are the thieves footpads

cutpurses manstealers of the community or if they are able to speak they

turn falsewitnesses and informers no small catalogue of crimes truly

even if the perpetrators are few yes i said but small and great are

relative terms and no crimes which are committed by them approach those of the

tyrant whom this class growing strong and numerous create out of themselves

if the people yield well and good but if they resist then as before he

beat his father and mother so now he beats his fatherland and motherland and

places his mercenaries over them such men in their early days live with

flatterers and they themselves flatter others in order to gain their ends

but they soon discard their followers when they have no longer any need of

them they are always either masters or servantsthe joys of friendship

are unknown to them and they are utterly treacherous and unjust if the nature

of justice be at all understood by us they realize our dream and he who is

the most of a tyrant by nature and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest

time will be the worst of them and being the worst of them will also be the

most miserable




like man like statethe tyrannical man will answer to tyranny which is

the extreme opposite of the royal state for one is the best and the other the

worst but which is the happier great and terrible as the tyrant may appear

enthroned amid his satellites let us not be afraid to go in and ask and the

answer is that the monarchical is the happiest and the tyrannical the most

miserable of states and may we not ask the same question about the men

themselves requesting some one to look into them who is able to penetrate the

inner nature of man and will not be panicstruck by the vain pomp of tyranny

i will suppose that he is one who has lived with him and has seen him in

family life or perhaps in the hour of trouble and danger




assuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek let us

begin by comparing the individual and state and ask first of all whether the

state is likely to be free or enslavedwill there not be a little freedom

and a great deal of slavery and the freedom is of the bad and the slavery of

the good and this applies to the man as well as to the state for his soul is

full of meanness and slavery and the better part is enslaved to the worse he

cannot do what he would and his mind is full of confusion he is the very

reverse of a freeman the state will be poor and full of misery and sorrow and

the mans soul will also be poor and full of sorrows and he will be the

most miserable of men no not the most miserable for there is yet a more

miserable who is that the tyrannical man who has the misfortune

also to become a public tyrant there i suspect that you are

right say rather i am sure conjecture is out of place

in an enquiry of this nature he is like a wealthy owner of slaves only he has

more of them than any private individual you will say the owners of

slaves are not generally in any fear of them but why because the whole

city is in a league which protects the individual suppose however that one of

these owners and his household is carried off by a god into a wilderness where

there are no freemen to help himwill he not be in an agony of

terrorwill he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to promise

them many things sore against his will and suppose the same god who carried

him off were to surround him with neighbours who declare that no man ought to

have slaves and that the owners of them should be punished with death

still worse and worse he will be in the midst of his enemies

and is not our tyrant such a captive soul who is tormented by a swarm of

passions which he cannot indulge living indoors always like a woman and

jealous of those who can go out and see the world




having so many evils will not the most miserable of men be still more

miserable in a public station master of others when he is not master of

himself like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete the meanest of

slaves and the most abject of flatterers wanting all things and never able to

satisfy his desires always in fear and distraction like the state of which he

is the representative his jealous hateful faithless temper grows worse with

command he is more and more faithless envious unrighteousthe most

wretched of men a misery to himself and to others and so let us have a final

trial and proclamation need we hire a herald or shall i proclaim the result

made the proclamation yourself the son of ariston the best is

of opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest and that this

is he who is the most royal master of himself and that the unjust man is he

who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his state and i add

furtherseen or unseen by gods or men




this is our first proof the second is derived from the three kinds of

pleasure which answer to the three elements of the soulreason passion

desire under which last is comprehended avarice as well as sensual appetite

while passion includes ambition partyfeeling love of reputation reason

again is solely directed to the attainment of truth and careless of money and

reputation in accordance with the difference of mens natures one of

these three principles is in the ascendant and they have their several

pleasures corresponding to them interrogate now the three natures and each

one will be found praising his own pleasures and depreciating those of others

the moneymaker will contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages

of wealth the ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour

whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth and will call

other pleasures necessary rather than good now how shall we decide between

them is there any better criterion than experience and knowledge and which of

the three has the truest knowledge and the widest experience the experience of

youth makes the philosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire but the

avaricious and the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom

honour he has equally with them they are judged of him but he

is not judged of them for they never attain to the knowledge of

true being and his instrument is reason whereas their standard is only wealth

and honour and if by reason we are to judge his good will be the truest and

so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the rational part of the soul

and a life passed in such pleasure is the pleasantest he who has a right to

judge judges thus next comes the life of ambition and in the third place

that of moneymaking




twice has the just man overthrown the unjustonce more as in an olympian

contest first offering up a prayer to the saviour zeus let him try a fall a

wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the wise are true and pure all

others are a shadow only let us examine this is not pleasure opposed to pain

and is there not a mean state which is neither when a man is sick nothing is

more pleasant to him than health but this he never found out while he was

well in pain he desires only to cease from pain on the other hand when he is

in an ecstasy of pleasure rest is painful to him thus rest or cessation is

both pleasure and pain but can that which is neither become both again

pleasure and pain are motions and the absence of them is rest but if so how

can the absence of either of them be the other thus we are led to infer that

the contradiction is an appearance only and witchery of the senses and these

are not the only pleasures for there are others which have no preceding pains

pure pleasure then is not the absence of pain nor pure pain the absence of

pleasure although most of the pleasures which reach the mind through the body

are reliefs of pain and have not only their reactions when they depart but

their anticipations before they come they can be best described in a simile

there is in nature an upper lower and middle region and he who passes from

the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already in the

upper world and if he were taken back again would think and truly think that

he was descending all this arises out of his ignorance of the true upper

middle and lower regions and a like confusion happens with pleasure and pain

and with many other things the man who compares grey with black calls grey

white and the man who compares absence of pain with pain calls the absence of

pain pleasure again hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body ignorance

and folly of the soul and food is the satisfaction of the one knowledge of

the other now which is the purer satisfactionthat of eating and

drinking or that of knowledge consider the matter thus the satisfaction of

that which has more existence is truer than of that which has less the

invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable and mortal

and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth the soul again has

more existence and truth and knowledge than the body and is therefore more

really satisfied and has a more natural pleasure those who feast only on

earthly food are always going at random up to the middle and down again but

they never pass into the true upper world or have a taste of true pleasure

they are like fatted beasts full of gluttony and sensuality and ready to kill

one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they are not filled with

true being and their vessel is leaky gorgias their pleasures are mere

shadows of pleasure mixed with pain coloured and intensified by contrast and

therefore intensely desired and men go fighting about them as stesichorus

says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy because they

know not the truth




the same may be said of the passionate elementthe desires of the

ambitious soul as well as of the covetous have an inferior satisfaction only

when under the guidance of reason do either of the other principles do their

own business or attain the pleasure which is natural to them when not

attaining they compel the other parts of the soul to pursue a shadow of

pleasure which is not theirs and the more distant they are from philosophy and

reason the more distant they will be from law and order and the more illusive

will be their pleasures the desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from

law and those of the king are nearest to it there is one genuine pleasure

and two spurious ones the tyrant goes beyond even the latter he has run away

altogether from law and reason nor can the measure of his inferiority be told

except in a figure the tyrant is the third removed from the oligarch and has

therefore not a shadow of his pleasure but the shadow of a shadow only the

oligarch again is thrice removed from the king and thus we get the formula 

x  which is the number of a surface representing the shadow which is the

tyrants pleasure and if you like to cube this number of the

beast you will find that the measure of the difference amounts to 

the king is  times more happy than the tyrant and this extraordinary number

is nearly equal to the number of days and nights in a year  x    and

is therefore concerned with human life this is the interval between a good and

bad man in happiness only what must be the difference between them in

comeliness of life and virtue




perhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our discussion

that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of justice now that

we know the nature of justice and injustice let us make an image of the soul

which will personify his words first of all fashion a multitudinous beast

having a ring of heads of all manner of animals tame and wild and able to

produce and change them at pleasure suppose now another form of a lion and

another of a man the second smaller than the first the third than the second

join them together and cover them with a human skin in which they are

completely concealed when this has been done let us tell the supporter of

injustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man the maintainer

of justice on the other hand is trying to strengthen the man he is

nourishing the gentle principle within him and making an alliance with the

lion heart in order that he may be able to keep down the manyheaded hydra

and bring all into unity with each other and with themselves thus in every

point of view whether in relation to pleasure honour or advantage the just

man is right and the unjust wrong




but now let us reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error is

not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in

man the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast and if so who

would receive gold on condition that he was to degrade the noblest part of

himself under the worstwho would sell his son or daughter into the

hands of brutal and evil men for any amount of money and will he sell his own

fairer and diviner part without any compunction to the most godless and foul

would he not be worse than eriphyle who sold her husbands life for a

necklace and intemperance is the letting loose of the multiform monster and

pride and sullenness are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent

element while luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great relaxation of

spirit flattery and meanness again arise when the spirited element is

subjected to avarice and the lion is habituated to become a monkey the real

disgrace of handicraft arts is that those who are engaged in them have to

flatter instead of mastering their desires therefore we say that they should

be placed under the control of the better principle in another because they

have none in themselves not as thrasymachus imagined to the injury of the

subjects but for their good and our intention in educating the young is to

give them selfcontrol the law desires to nurse up in them a higher principle

and when they have acquired this they may go their ways




what then shall a man profit if he gain the whole world and

become more and more wicked or what shall he profit by escaping discovery if

the concealment of evil prevents the cure if he had been punished the brute

within him would have been silenced and the gentler element liberated and he

would have united temperance justice and wisdom in his soula union

better far than any combination of bodily gifts the man of understanding will

honour knowledge above all in the next place he will keep under his body not

only for the sake of health and strength but in order to attain the most

perfect harmony of body and soul in the acquisition of riches too he will

aim at order and harmony he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure

but he will fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of

his own soul for the same reason he will only accept such honours as will make

him a better man any others he will decline in that case said

he he will never be a politician yes but he will in his own

city though probably not in his native country unless by some divine

accident you mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city which

has no place upon earth but in heaven i replied there is a pattern of

such a city and he who wishes may order his life after that image whether

such a state is or ever will be matters not he will act according to that

pattern and no other




the most noticeable points in the th book of the republic are the

account of pleasure  the number of the interval which divides the king from

the tyrant  the pattern which is in heaven




 platos account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation and in this

respect contrasts with the later platonists and the views which are attributed

to them by aristotle he is not like the cynics opposed to all pleasure but

rather desires that the several parts of the soul shall have their natural

satisfaction he even agrees with the epicureans in describing pleasure as

something more than the absence of pain this is proved by the circumstance

that there are pleasures which have no antecedent pains as he also remarks in

the philebus such as the pleasures of smell and also the pleasures of hope

and anticipation in the previous book he had made the distinction between

necessary and unnecessary pleasure which is repeated by aristotle and he now

observes that there are a further class of wild beast pleasures

corresponding to aristotles greek he dwells upon the relative and

unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion which arises out of the

contrast of pleasure and pain pointing out the superiority of the pleasures of

reason which are at rest over the fleeting pleasures of sense and emotion

the preeminence of royal pleasure is shown by the fact that reason is able to

form a judgment of the lower pleasures while the two lower parts of the soul

are incapable of judging the pleasures of reason thus in his treatment of

pleasure as in many other subjects the philosophy of plato is sawn up

into quantities by aristotle the analysis which was originally made by

him became in the next generation the foundation of further technical

distinctions both in plato and aristotle we note the illusion under which the

ancients fell of regarding the transience of pleasure as a proof of its

unreality and of confounding the permanence of the intellectual pleasures with

the unchangeableness of the knowledge from which they are derived neither do

we like to admit that the pleasures of knowledge though more elevating are

not more lasting than other pleasures and are almost equally dependent on the

accidents of our bodily state introduction to philebus




 the number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant and

royal from tyrannical pleasures is  the cube of  which plato

characteristically designates as a number concerned with human life because

nearly equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year he is desirous

of proclaiming that the interval between them is immeasurable and invents a

formula to give expression to his idea those who spoke of justice as a cube

of virtue as an art of measuring prot saw no inappropriateness in

conceiving the soul under the figure of a line or the pleasure of the tyrant

as separated from the pleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 

and in modern times we sometimes use metaphorically what plato employed as a

philosophical formula it is not easy to estimate the loss of the

tyrant except perhaps in this way says plato so we might say that

although the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad man yet

you may measure the difference between them by valuing one minute of the one at

an hour of the other one day in thy courts is better than a

thousand or you might say that there is an infinite

difference but this is not so much as saying in homely phrase

they are a thousand miles asunder and accordingly plato finds

the natural vehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers this

arithmetical formula he draws out with the utmost seriousness and both here

and in the number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth

of his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure just as

persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is verified when it

has been only thrown into an abstract form in speaking of the number  as

proper to human life he probably intended to intimate that one year of the

tyrannical   hours of the royal life




the simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is effected by

the comparison of the cubes of their sides is the mathematical groundwork of

this fanciful expression there is some difficulty in explaining the steps by

which the number  is obtained the oligarch is removed in the third degree

from the royal and aristocratical and the tyrant in the third degree from the

oligarchical but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square and to

count the oligarch twice over thus reckoning them not as   but as   the

square of  is passed lightly over as only a step towards the cube




 towards the close of the republic plato seems to be more and more convinced

of the ideal character of his own speculations at the end of the th book the

pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city of philosophers on

earth the vision which has received form and substance at his hands is now

discovered to be at a distance and yet this distant kingdom is also the rule

of mans life say not lo here or lo there for the kingdom of

god is within you thus a note is struck which prepares for the

revelation of a future life in the following book but the future life is

present still the ideal of politics is to be realized in the individual




book x many things pleased me in the order of our state but there was nothing

which i liked better than the regulation about poetry the division of the soul

throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation i do not mind telling you in

confidence that all poetry is an outrage on the understanding unless the

hearers have that balm of knowledge which heals error i have loved homer ever

since i was a boy and even now he appears to me to be the great master of

tragic poetry but much as i love the man i love truth more and therefore i

must speak out and first of all will you explain what is imitation for

really i do not understand how likely then that i should

understand that might very well be for the duller often sees better

than the keener eye true but in your presence i can hardly venture to

say what i think then suppose that we begin in our old fashion with

the doctrine of universals let us assume the existence of beds and tables

there is one idea of a bed or of a table which the maker of each had in his

mind when making them he did not make the ideas of beds and tables but he

made beds and tables according to the ideas and is there not a maker of the

works of all workmen who makes not only vessels but plants and animals

himself the earth and heaven and things in heaven and under the earth he

makes the gods also he must be a wizard indeed but do you not

see that there is a sense in which you could do the same you have only to take

a mirror and catch the reflection of the sun and the earth or anything

elsethere now you have made them yes but only in

appearance exactly so and the painter is such a creator as you are

with the mirror and he is even more unreal than the carpenter although

neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be supposed to make the absolute

bed not if philosophers may be believed nor need we wonder that

his bed has but an imperfect relation to the truth reflecthere are

three beds one in nature which is made by god another which is made by the

carpenter and the third by the painter god only made one nor could he have

made more than one for if there had been two there would always have been a

thirdmore absolute and abstract than either under which they would have

been included we may therefore conceive god to be the natural maker of the

bed and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker but the painter is

rather the imitator of what the other two make he has to do with a creation

which is thrice removed from reality and the tragic poet is an imitator and

like every other imitator is thrice removed from the king and from the truth

the painter imitates not the original bed but the bed made by the carpenter

and this without being really different appears to be different and has many

points of view of which only one is caught by the painter who represents

everything because he represents a piece of everything and that piece an

image and he can paint any other artist although he knows nothing of their

arts and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or simple people

suppose now that somebody came to us and told us how he had met a man who knew

all that everybody knows and better than anybodyshould we not infer

him to be a simpleton who having no discernment of truth and falsehood had

met with a wizard or enchanter whom he fancied to be allwise and when we

hear persons saying that homer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the

virtues must we not infer that they are under a similar delusion they do not

see that the poets are imitators and that their creations are only imitations

very true but if a person could create as well as imitate he

would rather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only he would

rather be the receiver than the giver of praise yes for then he would

have more honour and advantage




let us now interrogate homer and the poets friend homer say i to him i am

not going to ask you about medicine or any art to which your poems

incidentally refer but about their main subjectswar military tactics

politics if you are only twice and not thrice removed from the truthnot

an imitator or an imagemaker please to inform us what good you have ever done

to mankind is there any city which professes to have received laws from you

as sicily and italy have from charondas sparta from lycurgus athens from

solon or was any war ever carried on by your counsels or is any invention

attributed to you as there is to thales and anacharsis or is there any

homeric way of life such as the pythagorean was in which you instructed men

and which is called after you no indeed and creophylus fleshchild

was even more unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name if as

tradition says homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends

to starve yes but could this ever have happened if homer had really

been the educator of hellas would he not have had many devoted followers if

protagoras and prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can

manage house or state without them is it likely that homer and hesiod would

have been allowed to go about as beggarsi mean if they had really been

able to do the world any goodwould not men have compelled them to stay

where they were or have followed them about in order to get education but

they did not and therefore we may infer that homer and all the poets are only

imitators who do but imitate the appearances of things for as a painter by a

knowledge of figure and colour can paint a cobbler without any practice in

cobbling so the poet can delineate any art in the colours of language and

give harmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the general and you know

how mere narration when deprived of the ornaments of metre is like a face

which has lost the beauty of youth and never had any other once more the

imitator has no knowledge of reality but only of appearance the painter

paints and the artificer makes a bridle and reins but neither understands the

use of themthe knowledge of this is confined to the horseman and so of

other things thus we have three arts one of use another of invention a

third of imitation and the user furnishes the rule to the two others the

fluteplayer will know the good and bad flute and the maker will put faith in

him but the imitator will neither know nor have faithneither science

nor true opinion can be ascribed to him imitation then is devoid of

knowledge being only a kind of play or sport and the tragic and epic poets

are imitators in the highest degree




and now let us enquire what is the faculty in man which answers to imitation

allow me to explain my meaning objects are differently seen when in the water

and when out of the water when near and when at a distance and the painter or

juggler makes use of this variation to impose upon us and the art of measuring

and weighing and calculating comes in to save our bewildered minds from the

power of appearance for as we were saying two contrary opinions of the same

about the same and at the same time cannot both of them be true but which of

them is true is determined by the art of calculation and this is allied to the

better faculty in the soul as the arts of imitation are to the worse and the

same holds of the ear as well as of the eye of poetry as well as painting the

imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary in which there is an

expectation of a good or bad result and present experience of pleasure and

pain but is a man in harmony with himself when he is the subject of these

conflicting influences is there not rather a contradiction in him let me

further ask whether he is more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or

when he is in company in the latter case feeling would lead him

to indulge his sorrow but reason and law control him and enjoin patience

since he cannot know whether his affliction is good or evil and no human thing

is of any great consequence while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good

counsel for when we stumble we should not like children make an uproar we

should take the measures which reason prescribes not raising a lament but

finding a cure and the better part of us is ready to follow reason while the

irrational principle is full of sorrow and distraction at the recollection of

our troubles unfortunately however this latter furnishes the chief materials

of the imitative arts whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be

displayed especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of her thus

the poet is like the painter in two ways first he paints an inferior degree of

truth and secondly he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul he

indulges the feelings while he enfeebles the reason and we refuse to allow

him to have authority over the mind of man for he has no measure of greater

and less and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth




but we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictmentthe

power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings when we hear some

passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious length you know that

we sympathize with him and praise the poet and yet in our own sorrows such an

exhibition of feeling is regarded as effeminate and unmanly ion now ought a

man to feel pleasure in seeing another do what he hates and abominates in

himself is he not giving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would

controlhe is off his guard because the sorrow is anothers and

he thinks that he may indulge his feelings without disgrace and will be the

gainer by the pleasure but the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by

weeping at the sorrows of others will end by weeping at his own the same is

true of comedyyou may often laugh at buffoonery which you would be

ashamed to utter and the love of coarse merriment on the stage will at last

turn you into a buffoon at home poetry feeds and waters the passions and

desires she lets them rule instead of ruling them and therefore when we hear

the encomiasts of homer affirming that he is the educator of hellas and that

all life should be regulated by his precepts we may allow the excellence of

their intentions and agree with them in thinking homer a great poet and

tragedian but we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes beyond hymns

to the gods and praises of famous men not pleasure and pain but law and

reason shall rule in our state




these are our grounds for expelling poetry but lest she should charge us with

discourtesy let us also make an apology to her we will remind her that there

is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy of which there are many

traces in the writings of the poets such as the saying of the shedog

yelping at her mistress and the philosophers who are ready to

circumvent zeus and the philosophers who are paupers

nevertheless we bear her no illwill and will gladly allow her to return upon

condition that she makes a defence of herself in verse and her supporters who

are not poets may speak in prose we confess her charms but if she cannot show

that she is useful as well as delightful like rational lovers we must

renounce our love though endeared to us by early associations having come to

years of discretion we know that poetry is not truth and that a man should be

careful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he himself

is for there is a mighty issue at stakeno less than the good or evil of

a human soul and it is not worth while to forsake justice and virtue for the

attractions of poetry any more than for the sake of honour or wealth i

agree with you




and yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than i have described and

can we conceive things greater still not perhaps in this brief span

of life but should an immortal being care about anything short of eternity

i do not understand what you mean do you not know that the soul

is immortal surely you are not prepared to prove that indeed i

am then let me hear this argument of which you make so light




you would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil in all

things there is an inherent corruption and if this cannot destroy them

nothing else will the soul too has her own corrupting principles which are

injustice intemperance cowardice and the like but none of these destroy the

soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body the soul may be full of

all iniquities but is not by reason of them brought any nearer to death

nothing which was not destroyed from within ever perished by external affection

of evil the body which is one thing cannot be destroyed by food which is

another unless the badness of the food is communicated to the body neither

can the soul which is one thing be corrupted by the body which is another

unless she herself is infected and as no bodily evil can infect the soul

neither can any bodily evil whether disease or violence or any other destroy

the soul unless it can be shown to render her unholy and unjust but no one

will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust when they die if a

person has the audacity to say the contrary the answer isthen why do

criminals require the hand of the executioner and not die of themselves

truly he said injustice would not be very terrible if it

brought a cessation of evil but i rather believe that the injustice which

murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust

you are quite right if sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot

destroy the soul hardly will anything else destroy her but the soul which

cannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be immortal and

everlasting and if this be true souls will always exist in the same number

they cannot diminish because they cannot be destroyed nor yet increase for

the increase of the immortal must come from something mortal and so all would

end in immortality neither is the soul variable and diverse for that which is

immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition if we would conceive

her truly and so behold justice and injustice in their own nature she must be

viewed by the light of reason pure as at birth or as she is reflected in

philosophy when holding converse with the divine and immortal and eternal in

her present condition we see her only like the seagod glaucus bruised and

maimed in the sea which is the world and covered with shells and stones which

are incrusted upon her from the entertainments of earth




thus far as the argument required we have said nothing of the rewards and

honours which the poets attribute to justice we have contented ourselves with

showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in herself even if a man

should put on a gyges ring and have the helmet of hades too and now you

shall repay me what you borrowed and i will enumerate the rewards of justice

in life and after death i granted for the sake of argument as you will

remember that evil might perhaps escape the knowledge of gods and men

although this was really impossible and since i have shown that justice has

reality you must grant me also that she has the palm of appearance in the

first place the just man is known to the gods and he is therefore the friend

of the gods and he will receive at their hands every good always excepting

such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins all things end in

good to him either in life or after death even what appears to be evil for

the gods have a care of him who desires to be in their likeness and what shall

we say of men is not honesty the best policy the clever rogue makes a great

start at first but breaks down before he reaches the goal and slinks away in

dishonour whereas the true runner perseveres to the end and receives the

prize and you must allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed

to the fortunate unjustthey bear rule in the city they marry and give

in marriage to whom they will and the evils which you attributed to the

unfortunate just do really fall in the end on the unjust although as you

implied their sufferings are better veiled in silence




but all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared with

those which await good men after death i should like to hear about

them come then and i will tell you the story of er the son of

armenius a valiant man he was supposed to have died in battle but ten days

afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home for burial

on the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre and there he came to life

again and told what he had seen in the world below he said that his soul went

with a great company to a place in which there were two chasms near together

in the earth beneath and two corresponding chasms in the heaven above and

there were judges sitting in the intermediate space bidding the just ascend by

the heavenly way on the right hand having the seal of their judgment set upon

them before while the unjust having the seal behind were bidden to descend

by the way on the left hand him they told to look and listen as he was to be

their messenger to men from the world below and he beheld and saw the souls

departing after judgment at either chasm some who came from earth were worn

and travelstained others who came from heaven were clean and bright they

seemed glad to meet and rest awhile in the meadow here they discoursed with

one another of what they had seen in the other world those who came from earth

wept at the remembrance of their sorrows but the spirits from above spoke of

glorious sights and heavenly bliss he said that for every evil deed they were

punished tenfoldnow the journey was of a thousand years duration

because the life of man was reckoned as a hundred yearsand the rewards

of virtue were in the same proportion he added something hardly worth

repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were born of parricides

and other murderers he had tortures still more terrible to narrate he was

present when one of the spirits askedwhere is ardiaeus the great this

ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant who had murdered his father and his elder

brother a thousand years before another spirit answered he comes not

hither and will never come and i myself he added actually saw

this terrible sight at the entrance of the chasm as we were about to

reascend ardiaeus appeared and some other sinnersmost of whom had been

tyrants but not alland just as they fancied that they were returning to

life the chasm gave a roar and then wild fierylooking men who knew the

meaning of the sound seized him and several others and bound them hand and

foot and threw them down and dragged them along at the side of the road

lacerating them and carding them like wool and explaining to the passersby

that they were going to be cast into hell the greatest terror of the

pilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice and when there was

silence one by one they passed up with joy to these sufferings there were

corresponding delights




on the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey and in four

days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of light in colour

like a rainbow only brighter and clearer one day more brought them to the

place and they saw that this was the column of light which binds together the

whole universe the ends of the column were fastened to heaven and from them

hung the distaff of necessity on which all the heavenly bodies

turnedthe hook and spindle were of adamant and the whorl of a mixed

substance the whorl was in form like a number of boxes fitting into one

another with their edges turned upwards making together a single whorl which

was pierced by the spindle the outermost had the rim broadest and the inner

whorls were smaller and smaller and had their rims narrower the largest the

fixed stars was spangledthe seventh the sun was brightestthe

eighth the moon shone by the light of the sevenththe second and fifth

saturn and mercury were most like one another and yellower than the

eighththe third jupiter had the whitest lightthe fourth mars

was redthe sixth venus was in whiteness second the whole had one

motion but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner circles

were moving in the opposite with various degrees of swiftness and slowness

the spindle turned on the knees of necessity and a siren stood hymning upon

each circle while lachesis clotho and atropos the daughters of necessity

sat on thrones at equal intervals singing of past present and future

responsive to the music of the sirens clotho from time to time guiding the

outer circle with a touch of her right hand atropos with her left hand

touching and guiding the inner circles lachesis in turn putting forth her hand

from time to time to guide both of them on their arrival the pilgrims went to

lachesis and there was an interpreter who arranged them and taking from her

knees lots and samples of lives got up into a pulpit and said mortal

souls hear the words of lachesis the daughter of necessity a new period of

mortal life has begun and you may choose what divinity you please the

responsibility of choosing is with yougod is blameless after

speaking thus he cast the lots among them and each one took up the lot which

fell near him he then placed on the ground before them the samples of lives

many more than the souls present and there were all sorts of lives of men and

of animals there were tyrannies ending in misery and exile and lives of men

and women famous for their different qualities and also mixed lives made up

of wealth and poverty sickness and health here glaucon is the great risk of

human life and therefore the whole of education should be directed to the

acquisition of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil and

choose the good he should know all the combinations which occur in

lifeof beauty with poverty or with wealthof knowledge with

external goodsand at last choose with reference to the nature of the

soul regarding that only as the better life which makes men better and

leaving the rest and a man must take with him an iron sense of truth and right

into the world below that there too he may remain undazzled by wealth or the

allurements of evil and be determined to avoid the extremes and choose the

mean for this as the messenger reported the interpreter to have said is the

true happiness of man and any one as he proclaimed may if he choose with

understanding have a good lot even though he come last let not the

first be careless in his choice nor the last despair he spoke and

when he had spoken he who had drawn the first lot chose a tyranny he did not

see that he was fated to devour his own childrenand when he discovered

his mistake he wept and beat his breast blaming chance and the gods and

anybody rather than himself he was one of those who had come from heaven and

in his previous life had been a citizen of a wellordered state but he had

only habit and no philosophy like many another he made a bad choice because

he had no experience of life whereas those who came from earth and had seen

trouble were not in such a hurry to choose but if a man had followed

philosophy while upon earth and had been moderately fortunate in his lot he

might not only be happy here but his pilgrimage both from and to this world

would be smooth and heavenly nothing was more curious than the spectacle of

the choice at once sad and laughable and wonderful most of the souls only

seeking to avoid their own condition in a previous life he saw the soul of

orpheus changing into a swan because he would not be born of a woman there was

thamyras becoming a nightingale musical birds like the swan choosing to be

men the twentieth soul which was that of ajax preferring the life of a lion

to that of a man in remembrance of the injustice which was done to him in the

judgment of the arms and agamemnon from a like enmity to human nature

passing into an eagle about the middle was the soul of atalanta choosing the

honours of an athlete and next to her epeus taking the nature of a workwoman

among the last was thersites who was changing himself into a monkey thither

the last of all came odysseus and sought the lot of a private man which lay

neglected and despised and when he found it he went away rejoicing and said

that if he had been first instead of last his choice would have been the same

men too were seen passing into animals and wild and tame animals changing

into one another




when all the souls had chosen they went to lachesis who sent with each of them

their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot he first of all brought them

under the hand of clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle

impelled by her hand from her they were carried to atropos who made the

threads irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the

throne of necessity and when they had all passed they moved on in scorching

heat to the plain of forgetfulness and rested at evening by the river

unmindful whose water could not be retained in any vessel of this they had

all to drink a certain quantitysome of them drank more than was

required and he who drank forgot all things er himself was prevented from

drinking when they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there were

thunderstorms and earthquakes and suddenly they were all driven divers ways

shooting like stars to their birth concerning his return to the body he only

knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found himself lying on the pyre




thus glaucon the tale has been saved and will be our salvation if we

believe that the soul is immortal and hold fast to the heavenly way of justice

and knowledge so shall we pass undefiled over the river of forgetfulness and

be dear to ourselves and to the gods and have a crown of reward and happiness

both in this world and also in the millennial pilgrimage of the other




the tenth book of the republic of plato falls into two divisions first

resuming an old thread which has been interrupted socrates assails the poets

who now that the nature of the soul has been analyzed are seen to be very far

gone from the truth and secondly having shown the reality of the happiness of

the just he demands that appearance shall be restored to him and then

proceeds to prove the immortality of the soul the argument as in the phaedo

and gorgias is supplemented by the vision of a future life




why plato who was himself a poet and whose dialogues are poems and dramas

should have been hostile to the poets as a class and especially to the

dramatic poets why he should not have seen that truth may be embodied in verse

as well as in prose and that there are some indefinable lights and shadows of

human life which can only be expressed in poetrysome elements of

imagination which always entwine with reason why he should have supposed epic

verse to be inseparably associated with the impurities of the old hellenic

mythology why he should try homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of

utilityare questions which have always been debated amongst students of

plato though unable to give a complete answer to them we may

showfirst that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of

his age and secondly we may elicit the truth as well as the error which is

contained in them




he is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own lifetime

and a theatrocracy as he says in the laws had taken the place of an

intellectual aristocracy euripides exhibited the last phase of the tragic

drama and in him plato saw the friend and apologist of tyrants and the

sophist of tragedy the old comedy was almost extinct the new had not yet

arisen dramatic and lyric poetry like every other branch of greek literature

was falling under the power of rhetoric there was no second or

third to aeschylus and sophocles in the generation which followed them

aristophanes in one of his later comedies frogs speaks of thousands

of tragedymaking prattlers whose attempts at poetry he compares to the

chirping of swallows their garrulity went far beyond

euripidesthey appeared once upon the stage and there was

an end of them to a man of genius who had a real appreciation of the

godlike aeschylus and the noble and gentle sophocles though disagreeing with

some parts of their theology rep these minor

poets must have been contemptible and intolerable there is no feeling

stronger in the dialogues of plato than a sense of the decline and decay both

in literature and in politics which marked his own age nor can he have been

expected to look with favour on the licence of aristophanes now at the end of

his career who had begun by satirizing socrates in the clouds and in a

similar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of ideal

commonwealths in his eccleziazusae or female parliament laws




there were other reasons for the antagonism of plato to poetry the profession

of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human nature for

one man in his life cannot play many parts the

characters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character and to

leave nothing which can be truly called himself neither can any man live his

life and act it the actor is the slave of his art not the master of it

taking this view plato is more decided in his expulsion of the dramatic than of

the epic poets though he must have known that the greek tragedians afforded

noble lessons and examples of virtue and patriotism to which nothing in homer

can be compared but great dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly

consistent with firmness or strength of mind and dramatic talent is often

incidentally associated with a weak or dissolute character




in the tenth book plato introduces a new series of objections first he says

that the poet or painter is an imitator and in the third degree removed from

the truth his creations are not tested by rule and measure they are only

appearances in modern times we should say that art is not merely imitation

but rather the expression of the ideal in forms of sense even adopting the

humble image of plato from which his argument derives a colour we should

maintain that the artist may ennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of

the drapery or by the feeling of home which he introduces and there have been

modern painters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a

blacksmiths or a carpenters shop the eye or mind which feels as

well as sees can give dignity and pathos to a ruined mill or a strawbuilt

shed rembrandt to the hull of a vessel going to its last home

turner still more would this apply to the greatest works of art which seem

to be the visible embodiment of the divine had plato been asked whether the

zeus or athene of pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only would he not

have been compelled to admit that something more was to be found in them than

in the form of any mortal and that the rule of proportion to which they

conformed was higher far than any geometry or arithmetic could

express statesman




again plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the emotional

rather than the rational part of human nature he does not admit

aristotles theory that tragedy or other serious imitations are a

purgation of the passions by pity and fear to him they appear only to afford

the opportunity of indulging them yet we must acknowledge that we may

sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to them and that they

often gain strength when pent up within our own breast it is not every

indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned for there may be a

gratification of the higher as well as of the lowerthoughts which are

too deep or too sad to be expressed by ourselves may find an utterance in the

words of poets every one would acknowledge that there have been times when

they were consoled and elevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of

architecture or by the peacefulness of nature plato has himself admitted in

the earlier part of the republic that the arts might have the effect of

harmonizing as well as of enervating the mind but in the tenth book he regards

them through a stoic or puritan medium he asks only what good have they

done and is not satisfied with the reply that they have given

innocent pleasure to mankind




he tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets since he has found

by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the inferior

faculties he means to say that the higher faculties have to do with

universals the lower with particulars of sense the poets are on a level with

their own age but not on a level with socrates and plato and he was well

aware that homer and hesiod could not be made a rule of life by any process of

legitimate interpretation his ironical use of them is in fact a denial of

their authority he saw too that the poets were not criticsas he says

in the apology any one was a better interpreter of their writings than

they were themselves he himself ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple

of socrates though as he tells us of solon he might have been one of

the greatest of them if he had not been deterred by other pursuits

tim thus from many points of view there is an antagonism between plato and

the poets which was foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between philosophy

and poetry the poets as he says in the protagoras were the sophists of their

day and his dislike of the one class is reflected on the other he regards

them both as the enemies of reasoning and abstraction though in the case of

euripides more with reference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the

like for plato is the prophet who came into the world to convince

menfirst of the fallibility of sense and opinion and secondly of

the reality of abstract ideas whatever strangeness there may be in modern

times in opposing philosophy to poetry which to us seem to have so many

elements in common the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of poetry as

allied to sense and of philosophy as equivalent to thought and abstraction

unfortunately the very word idea which to plato is expressive of

the most real of all things is associated in our minds with an element of

subjectiveness and unreality we may note also how he differs from aristotle

who declares poetry to be truer than history for the opposite reason because

it is concerned with universals not like history with particulars poet




the things which are seen are opposed in scripture to the things which are

unseenthey are equally opposed in plato to universals and ideas to him

all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense they have a

taint of error or even of evil there is no difficulty in seeing that this is

an illusion for there is no more error or variation in an individual man

horse bed etc than in the class man horse bed etc nor is the truth

which is displayed in individual instances less certain than that which is

conveyed through the medium of ideas but plato who is deeply impressed with

the real importance of universals as instruments of thought attributes to them

an essential truth which is imaginary and unreal for universals may be often

false and particulars true had he attained to any clear conception of the

individual which is the synthesis of the universal and the particular or had

he been able to distinguish between opinion and sensation which the ambiguity

of the words greek and the like tended to confuse he would not have denied

truth to the particulars of sense




but the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in all

departments of life and knowledge like the sophists and rhetoricians of the

gorgias and phaedrus they are the false priests false prophets lying

spirits enchanters of the world there is another count put into the

indictment against them by plato that they are the friends of the tyrant and

bask in the sunshine of his patronage despotism in all ages has had an

apparatus of false ideas and false teachers at its servicein the history

of modern europe as well as of greece and rome for no government of men

depends solely upon force without some corruption of literature and

moralssome appeal to the imagination of the massessome pretence

to the favour of heavensome element of good giving power to evil

tyranny even for a short time cannot be maintained the greek tyrants were

not insensible to the importance of awakening in their cause a pseudohellenic

feeling they were proud of successes at the olympic games they were not

devoid of the love of literature and art plato is thinking in the first

instance of greek poets who had graced the courts of dionysius or archelaus

and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their prostitution of the

tragic muse in the praises of tyranny but his prophetic eye extends beyond

them to the false teachers of other ages who are the creatures of the

government under which they live he compares the corruption of his

contemporaries with the idea of a perfect society and gathers up into one mass

of evil the evils and errors of mankind to him they are personified in the

rhetoricians sophists poets rulers who deceive and govern the world




a further objection which plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts is that

they excite the emotions here the modern reader will be disposed to introduce

a distinction which appears to have escaped him for the emotions are neither

bad nor good in themselves and are not most likely to be controlled by the

attempt to eradicate them but by the moderate indulgence of them and the

vocation of art is to present thought in the form of feeling to enlist the

feelings on the side of reason to inspire even for a moment courage or

resignation perhaps to suggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which

mere language is incapable of attaining true the same power which in the

purer age of art embodies gods and heroes only may be made to express the

voluptuous image of a corinthian courtezan but this only shows that art like

other outward things may be turned to good and also to evil and is not more

closely connected with the higher than with the lower part of the soul all

imitative art is subject to certain limitations and therefore necessarily

partakes of the nature of a compromise something of ideal truth is sacrificed

for the sake of the representation and something in the exactness of the

representation is sacrificed to the ideal still works of art have a permanent

element they idealize and detain the passing thought and are the

intermediates between sense and ideas




in the present stage of the human mind poetry and other forms of fiction may

certainly be regarded as a good but we can also imagine the existence of an

age in which a severer conception of truth has either banished or transformed

them at any rate we must admit that they hold a different place at different

periods of the worlds history in the infancy of mankind poetry with

the exception of proverbs is the whole of literature and the only instrument

of intellectual culture in modern times she is the shadow or echo of her

former self and appears to have a precarious existence milton in his day

doubted whether an epic poem was any longer possible at the same time we must

remember that what plato would have called the charms of poetry have been

partly transferred to prose he himself statesman admits rhetoric to be the

handmaiden of politics and proposes to find in the strain of law laws a

substitute for the old poets among ourselves the creative power seems often to

be growing weaker and scientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering

to the mind than formerly the illusion of the feelings commonly called love

has hitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and romance and has

exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence on the world but may

not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some day exhausted the

modern english novel which is the most popular of all forms of reading is not

more than a century or two old will the tale of love a hundred years hence

after so many thousand variations of the same theme be still received with

unabated interest




art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion and may often

corrupt them it is possible to conceive a mental state in which all artistic

representations are regarded as a false and imperfect expression either of the

religious ideal or of the philosophical ideal the fairest forms may be

revolting in certain moods of mind as is proved by the fact that the

mahometans and many sects of christians have renounced the use of pictures

and images the beginning of a great religion whether christian or gentile

has not been wood or stone but a spirit moving in the hearts of

men the disciples have met in a large upper room or in holes and caves

of the earth in the second or third generation they have had mosques

temples churches monasteries and the revival or reform of religions like

the first revelation of them has come from within and has generally

disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments




but poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and the

purest sentiment plato himself seems to waver between two opposite

viewswhen as in the third book he insists that youth should be brought

up amid wholesome imagery and again in book x when he banishes the poets from

his republic admitting that the arts which some of us almost deify have

fallen short of their higher aim we must admit on the other hand that to

banish imagination wholly would be suicidal as well as impossible for nature

too is a form of art and a breath of the fresh air or a single glance at the

varying landscape would in an instant revive and reillumine the extinguished

spark of poetry in the human breast in the lower stages of civilization

imagination more than reason distinguishes man from the animals and to banish

art would be to banish thought to banish language to banish the expression of

all truth no religion is wholly devoid of external forms even the mahometan

who renounces the use of pictures and images has a temple in which he worships

the most high as solemn and beautiful as any greek or christian building

feeling too and thought are not really opposed for he who thinks must feel

before he can execute and the highest thoughts when they become familiarized

to us are always tending to pass into the form of feeling




plato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society but he

feels strongly the unreality of their writings he is protesting against the

degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest against the want of

serious purpose in modern fiction against the unseemliness or extravagance of

some of our poets or novelists against the timeserving of preachers or public

writers against the regardlessness of truth which to the eye of the

philosopher seems to characterize the greater part of the world for we too

have reason to complain that our poets and novelists paint inferior

truth and are concerned with the inferior part of the

soul that the readers of them become what they read and are injuriously

affected by them and we look in vain for that healthy atmosphere of which

plato speaksthe beauty which meets the sense like a breeze and

imperceptibly draws the soul even in childhood into harmony with the beauty

of reason




for there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine perfection the

harmony of goodness and truth among men a strain which should renew the youth

of the world and bring back the ages in which the poet was mans only

teacher and best friendwhich would find materials in the living present

as well as in the romance of the past and might subdue to the fairest forms of

speech and verse the intractable materials of modern civilisationwhich

might elicit the simple principles or as plato would have called them the

essential forms of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the

complexity of modern societywhich would preserve all the good of each

generation and leave the bad unsungwhich should be based not on vain

longings or faint imaginings but on a clear insight into the nature of man

then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose two in one united

in the pursuit of knowledge or the service of god and man and feelings of

love might still be the incentive to great thoughts and heroic deeds as in the

days of dante or petrarch and many types of manly and womanly beauty might

appear among us rising above the ordinary level of humanity and many lives

which were like poems laws be not only written but lived by us a few such

strains have been heard among men in the tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles

whom plato quotes not as homer is quoted by him in irony but with deep and

serious approvalin the poetry of milton and wordsworth and in passages

of other english poetsfirst and above all in the hebrew prophets and

psalmists shakespeare has taught us how great men should speak and act he has

drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth he has ennobled the human

mind but like homer rep he has left no way of life the

next greatest poet of modern times goethe is concerned with a lower

degree of truth he paints the world as a stage on which all the

men and women are merely players he cultivates life as an art but he

furnishes no ideals of truth and action the poet may rebel against any attempt

to set limits to his fancy and he may argue truly that moralizing in verse is

not poetry possibly like mephistopheles in faust he may retaliate on his

adversaries but the philosopher will still be justified in asking how

may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind




returning to plato we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and error

appears in other parts of the argument he is aware of the absurdity of mankind

framing their whole lives according to homer just as in the phaedrus he

intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology upon rational principles

both these were the modern tendencies of his own age which he deservedly

ridicules on the other hand his argument that homer if he had been able to

teach mankind anything worth knowing would not have been allowed by them to go

about begging as a rhapsodist is both false and contrary to the spirit of

plato rep it may be compared with those other paradoxes of the gorgias

that no statesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he

was the head and that no sophist was ever defrauded by his

pupils gorg




the argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of soul and

body admitting the existence of the soul we know of no force which is able to

put an end to her vice is her own proper evil and if she cannot be destroyed

by that she cannot be destroyed by any other yet plato has acknowledged that

the soul may be so overgrown by the incrustations of earth as to lose her

original form and in the timaeus he recognizes more strongly than in the

republic the influence which the body has over the mind denying even the

voluntariness of human actions on the ground that they proceed from physical

states tim in the republic as elsewhere he wavers between the original

soul which has to be restored and the character which is developed by training

and education




the vision of another world is ascribed to er the son of armenius who is said

by clement of alexandria to have been zoroaster the tale has certainly an

oriental character and may be compared with the pilgrimages of the soul in the

zend avesta haug avesta but no trace of acquaintance with zoroaster is

found elsewhere in platos writings and there is no reason for giving

him the name of er the pamphylian the philosophy of heracleitus cannot be

shown to be borrowed from zoroaster and still less the myths of plato




the local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the phaedrus

and phaedo astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology the great sphere

of heaven is represented under the symbol of a cylinder or box containing the

seven orbits of the planets and the fixed stars this is suspended from an axis

or spindle which turns on the knees of necessity the revolutions of the seven

orbits contained in the cylinder are guided by the fates and their harmonious

motion produces the music of the spheres through the innermost or eighth of

these which is the moon is passed the spindle but it is doubtful whether

this is the continuation of the column of light from which the pilgrims

contemplate the heavens the words of plato imply that they are connected but

not the same the column itself is clearly not of adamant the spindle which

is of adamant is fastened to the ends of the chains which extend to the middle

of the column of lightthis column is said to hold together the heaven

but whether it hangs from the spindle or is at right angles to it is not

explained the cylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a

symbol as the figure of necessity turning the spindlefor the outermost

rim is the sphere of the fixed stars and nothing is said about the intervals

of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens the description is

both a picture and an orrery and therefore is necessarily inconsistent with

itself the column of light is not the milky waywhich is neither

straight nor like a rainbowbut the imaginary axis of the earth this is

compared to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour and not to the

undergirders of a trireme but to the straight rope running from prow to stern

in which the undergirders meet




the orrery or picture of the heavens given in the republic differs in its mode

of representation from the circles of the same and of the other in the timaeus

in both the fixed stars are distinguished from the planets and they move in

orbits without them although in an opposite direction in the republic as in

the timaeus they are all moving round the axis of the world but we are not

certain that in the former they are moving round the earth no distinct mention

is made in the republic of the circles of the same and other although both in

the timaeus and in the republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed to

coincide with the motion of the whole the relative thickness of the rims is

perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the planets plato

probably intended to represent the earth from which er and his companions are

viewing the heavens as stationary in place but whether or not herself

revolving unless this is implied in the revolution of the axis is uncertain

timaeus the spectator may be supposed to look at the heavenly bodies either

from above or below the earth is a sort of earth and heaven in one like the

heaven of the phaedrus on the back of which the spectator goes out to take a

peep at the stars and is borne round in the revolution there is no distinction

between the equator and the ecliptic but plato is no doubt led to imagine that

the planets have an opposite motion to that of the fixed stars in order to

account for their appearances in the heavens in the description of the meadow

and the retribution of the good and evil after death there are traces of

homer




the description of the axis as a spindle and of the heavenly bodies as forming

a whole partly arises out of the attempt to connect the motions of the

heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web or weaving of the

fates the giving of the lots the weaving of them and the making of them

irreversible which are ascribed to the three fateslachesis clotho

atropos are obviously derived from their names the element of chance in human

life is indicated by the order of the lots but chance however adverse may be

overcome by the wisdom of man if he knows how to choose aright there is a

worse enemy to man than chance this enemy is himself he who was moderately

fortunate in the number of the loteven the very last comermight

have a good life if he chose with wisdom and as plato does not like to make an

assertion which is unproven he more than confirms this statement a few

sentences afterwards by the example of odysseus who chose last but the virtue

which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man to choose he must

add to virtue knowledge if he is to act rightly when placed in new

circumstances the routine of good actions and good habits is an inferior sort

of goodness and as coleridge says common sense is intolerable which

is not based on metaphysics so plato would have said habit is

worthless which is not based upon philosophy




the freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is distinctly

asserted virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will

have more or less of her the life of man is rounded by

necessity there are circumstances prior to birth which affect him pol but

within the walls of necessity there is an open space in which he is his own

master and can study for himself the effects which the variously compounded

gifts of nature or fortune have upon the soul and act accordingly all men

cannot have the first choice in everything but the lot of all men is good

enough if they choose wisely and will live diligently




the verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand years by the

intimation that ardiaeus had lived a thousand years before the coincidence of

er coming to life on the twelfth day after he was supposed to have been dead

with the seven days which the pilgrims passed in the meadow and the four days

during which they journeyed to the column of light the precision with which

the soul is mentioned who chose the twentieth lot the passing remarks that

there was no definite character among the souls and that the souls which had

chosen ill blamed any one rather than themselves or that some of the souls

drank more than was necessary of the waters of forgetfulness while er himself

was hindered from drinking the desire of odysseus to rest at last unlike the

conception of him in dante and tennyson the feigned ignorance of how er

returned to the body when the other souls went shooting like stars to their

birthadd greatly to the probability of the narrative they are such

touches of nature as the art of defoe might have introduced when he wished to

win credibility for marvels and apparitions





there still remain to be considered some points which have been intentionally

reserved to the end  the januslike character of the republic which

presents two facesone an hellenic state the other a kingdom of

philosophers connected with the latter of the two aspects are  the

paradoxes of the republic as they have been termed by morgenstern a the

community of property b of families c the rule of philosophers d the

analogy of the individual and the state which like some other analogies in

the republic is carried too far we may then proceed to consider  the

subject of education as conceived by plato bringing together in a general view

the education of youth and the education of afterlife  we may note further

some essential differences between ancient and modern politics which are

suggested by the republic  we may compare the politicus and the laws 

we may observe the influence exercised by plato on his imitators and  take

occasion to consider the nature and value of political and  of religious

ideals




 plato expressly says that he is intending to found an hellenic state book

v many of his regulations are characteristically spartan such as the

prohibition of gold and silver the common meals of the men the military

training of the youth the gymnastic exercises of the women the life of sparta

was the life of a camp laws enforced even more rigidly in time of peace than

in war the citizens of sparta like platos were forbidden to

tradethey were to be soldiers and not shopkeepers nowhere else in

greece was the individual so completely subjected to the state the time when

he was to marry the education of his children the clothes which he was to

wear the food which he was to eat were all prescribed by law some of the

best enactments in the republic such as the reverence to be paid to parents

and elders and some of the worst such as the exposure of deformed children

are borrowed from the practice of sparta the encouragement of friendships

between men and youths or of men with one another as affording incentives to

bravery is also spartan in sparta too a nearer approach was made than in any

other greek state to equality of the sexes and to community of property and

while there was probably less of licentiousness in the sense of immorality the

tie of marriage was regarded more lightly than in the rest of greece the

suprema lex was the preservation of the family and the interest

of the state the coarse strength of a military government was not favourable

to purity and refinement and the excessive strictness of some regulations

seems to have produced a reaction of all hellenes the spartans were most

accessible to bribery several of the greatest of them might be described in

the words of plato as having a fierce secret longing after gold and

silver though not in the strict sense communists the principle of

communism was maintained among them in their division of lands in their common

meals in their slaves and in the free use of one anothers goods

marriage was a public institution and the women were educated by the state

and sang and danced in public with the men




many traditions were preserved at sparta of the severity with which the

magistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry as in the

republic of plato the newfangled poet was to be expelled hymns to the gods

which are the only kind of music admitted into the ideal state were the only

kind which was permitted at sparta the spartans though an unpoetical race

were nevertheless lovers of poetry they had been stirred by the elegiac

strains of tyrtaeus they had crowded around hippias to hear his recitals of

homer but in this they resembled the citizens of the timocratic rather than of

the ideal state the council of elder men also corresponds to the spartan

gerousia and the freedom with which they are permitted to judge about matters

of detail agrees with what we are told of that institution once more the

military rule of not spoiling the dead or offering arms at the temples the

moderation in the pursuit of enemies the importance attached to the physical

wellbeing of the citizens the use of warfare for the sake of defence rather

than of aggressionare features probably suggested by the spirit and

practice of sparta




to the spartan type the ideal state reverts in the first decline and the

character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the spartan citizen the

love of lacedaemon not only affected plato and xenophon but was shared by many

undistinguished athenians there they seemed to find a principle which was

wanting in their own democracy the greek of the spartans attracted them

that is to say not the goodness of their laws but the spirit of order and

loyalty which prevailed fascinated by the idea citizens of athens would

imitate the lacedaemonians in their dress and manners they were known to the

contemporaries of plato as the persons who had their ears

bruised like the roundheads of the commonwealth the love of another

church or country when seen at a distance only the longing for an imaginary

simplicity in civilized times the fond desire of a past which never has been

or of a future which never will bethese are aspirations of the human

mind which are often felt among ourselves such feelings meet with a response

in the republic of plato




but there are other features of the platonic republic as for example the

literary and philosophical education and the grace and beauty of life which

are the reverse of spartan plato wishes to give his citizens a taste of

athenian freedom as well as of lacedaemonian discipline his individual genius

is purely athenian although in theory he is a lover of sparta and he is

something more than eitherhe has also a true hellenic feeling he is

desirous of humanizing the wars of hellenes against one another he

acknowledges that the delphian god is the grand hereditary interpreter of all

hellas the spirit of harmony and the dorian mode are to prevail and the whole

state is to have an external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within

but he has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in the

lawsthat he was a better legislator who made men to be of one mind than

he who trained them for war the citizens as in other hellenic states

democratic as well as aristocratic are really an upper class for although no

mention is made of slaves the lower classes are allowed to fade away into the

distance and are represented in the individual by the passions plato has no

idea either of a social state in which all classes are harmonized or of a

federation of hellas or the world in which different nations or states have a

place his city is equipped for war rather than for peace and this would seem

to be justified by the ordinary condition of hellenic states the myth of the

earthborn men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of hellas and the

allusion to the four ages of the world is also sanctioned by the authority of

hesiod and the poets thus we see that the republic is partly founded on the

ideal of the old greek polis partly on the actual circumstances of hellas in

that age plato like the old painters retains the traditional form and like

them he has also a vision of a city in the clouds




there is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the work for

the republic is not only a dorian state but a pythagorean league the

way of life which was connected with the name of pythagoras like

the catholic monastic orders showed the power which the mind of an individual

might exercise over his contemporaries and may have naturally suggested to

plato the possibility of reviving such mediaeval institutions

the pythagoreans like plato enforced a rule of life and a moral and

intellectual training the influence ascribed to music which to us seems

exaggerated is also a pythagorean feature it is not to be regarded as

representing the real influence of music in the greek world more nearly than

any other government of hellas the pythagorean league of three hundred was an

aristocracy of virtue for once in the history of mankind the philosophy of

order or greek expressing and consequently enlisting on its side the

combined endeavours of the better part of the people obtained the management

of public affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time until

about bc  probably only in states prepared by dorian institutions would

such a league have been possible the rulers like platos greek were

required to submit to a severe training in order to prepare the way for the

education of the other members of the community long after the dissolution of

the order eminent pythagoreans such as archytas of tarentum retained their

political influence over the cities of magna graecia there was much here that

was suggestive to the kindred spirit of plato who had doubtless meditated

deeply on the way of life of pythagoras rep and his followers

slight traces of pythagoreanism are to be found in the mystical number of the

state in the number which expresses the interval between the king and the

tyrant in the doctrine of transmigration in the music of the spheres as well

as in the great though secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in

education




but as in his philosophy so also in the form of his state he goes far beyond

the old pythagoreans he attempts a task really impossible which is to unite

the past of greek history with the future of philosophy analogous to that

other impossibility which has often been the dream of christendom the attempt

to unite the past history of europe with the kingdom of christ nothing

actually existing in the world at all resembles platos ideal state nor

does he himself imagine that such a state is possible this he repeats again

and again eg in the republic or in the laws where casting a glance back on

the republic he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy was

impossible in his own age though still to be retained as a pattern the same

doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he argues in the republic that

ideals are none the worse because they cannot be realized in fact and in the

chorus of laughter which like a breaking wave will as he anticipates greet

the mention of his proposals though like other writers of fiction he uses all

his art to give reality to his inventions when asked how the ideal polity can

come into being he answers ironically when one son of a king becomes a

philosopher he designates the fiction of the earthborn men as a

noble lie and when the structure is finally complete he fairly tells

you that his republic is a vision only which in some sense may have reality

but not in the vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon earth it has been

said that plato flies as well as walks but this falls short of the truth for

he flies and walks at the same time and is in the air and on firm ground in

successive instants




niebuhr has asked a trifling question which may be briefly noticed in this

placewas plato a good citizen if by this is meant was he loyal to

athenian institutionshe can hardly be said to be the friend of

democracy but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of

government all of them he regarded as states of faction laws

none attained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects which

seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other and the worst of

them is tyranny the truth is that the question has hardly any meaning when

applied to a great philosopher whose writings are not meant for a particular

age and country but for all time and all mankind the decline of athenian

politics was probably the motive which led plato to frame an ideal state and

the republic may be regarded as reflecting the departing glory of hellas as

well might we complain of st augustine whose great work the city of

god originated in a similar motive for not being loyal to the roman

empire even a nearer parallel might be afforded by the first christians who

cannot fairly be charged with being bad citizens because though subject

to the higher powers they were looking forward to a city which is in

heaven




 the idea of the perfect state is full of paradox when judged of according to

the ordinary notions of mankind the paradoxes of one age have been said to

become the commonplaces of the next but the paradoxes of plato are at least as

paradoxical to us as they were to his contemporaries the modern world has

either sneered at them as absurd or denounced them as unnatural and immoral

men have been pleased to find in aristotles criticisms of them the

anticipation of their own good sense the wealthy and cultivated classes have

disliked and also dreaded them they have pointed with satisfaction to the

failure of efforts to realize them in practice yet since they are the thoughts

of one of the greatest of human intelligences and of one who had done most to

elevate morality and religion they seem to deserve a better treatment at our

hands we may have to address the public as plato does poetry and assure them

that we mean no harm to existing institutions there are serious errors which

have a side of truth and which therefore may fairly demand a careful

consideration there are truths mixed with error of which we may indeed say

the half is better than the whole yet the half may

be an important contribution to the study of human nature




a the first paradox is the community of goods which is mentioned slightly at

the end of the third book and seemingly as aristotle observes is confined to

the guardians at least no mention is made of the other classes but the

omission is not of any real significance and probably arises out of the plan

of the work which prevents the writer from entering into details




aristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of modern

political economy as tending to repress industry and as doing away with the

spirit of benevolence modern writers almost refuse to consider the subject

which is supposed to have been long ago settled by the common opinion of

mankind but it must be remembered that the sacredness of property is a notion

far more fixed in modern than in ancient times the world has grown older and

is therefore more conservative primitive society offered many examples of land

held in common either by a tribe or by a township and such may probably have

been the original form of landed tenure ancient legislators had invented

various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land among the

citizens according to aristotle there were nations who held the land in common

and divided the produce and there were others who divided the land and stored

the produce in common the evils of debt and the inequality of property were

far greater in ancient than in modern times and the accidents to which

property was subject from war or revolution or taxation or other legislative

interference were also greater all these circumstances gave property a less

fixed and sacred character the early christians are believed to have held

their property in common and the principle is sanctioned by the words of

christ himself and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in almost

all ages of the church nor have there been wanting instances of modern

enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism in every age of religious

excitement notions like wycliffes inheritance of grace

have tended to prevail a like spirit but fiercer and more violent has

appeared in politics the preparation of the gospel of peace soon

becomes the red flag of republicanism




we can hardly judge what effect platos views would have upon his own

contemporaries they would perhaps have seemed to them only an exaggeration of

the spartan commonwealth even modern writers would acknowledge that the right

of private property is based on expediency and may be interfered with in a

variety of ways for the public good any other mode of vesting property which

was found to be more advantageous would in time acquire the same basis of

right the most useful in platos words would be

the most sacred the lawyers and ecclesiastics of former ages would have

spoken of property as a sacred institution but they only meant by such

language to oppose the greatest amount of resistance to any invasion of the

rights of individuals and of the church




when we consider the question without any fear of immediate application to

practice in the spirit of platos republic are we quite sure that the

received notions of property are the best is the distribution of wealth which

is customary in civilized countries the most favourable that can be conceived

for the education and development of the mass of mankind can the

spectator of all time and all existence be quite convinced that one or

two thousand years hence great changes will not have taken place in the rights

of property or even that the very notion of property beyond what is necessary

for personal maintenance may not have disappeared this was a distinction

familiar to aristotle though likely to be laughed at among ourselves such a

change would not be greater than some other changes through which the world has

passed in the transition from ancient to modern society for example the

emancipation of the serfs in russia or the abolition of slavery in america and

the west indies and not so great as the difference which separates the eastern

village community from the western world to accomplish such a revolution in

the course of a few centuries would imply a rate of progress not more rapid

than has actually taken place during the last fifty or sixty years the kingdom

of japan underwent more change in five or six years than europe in five or six

hundred many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished among ourselves

quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have passed away and the most

untenable propositions respecting the right of bequests or entail have been

maintained with as much fervour as the most moderate some one will be heard to

ask whether a state of society can be final in which the interests of thousands

are perilled on the life or character of a single person and many will indulge

the hope that our present condition may after all be only transitional and

may conduct to a higher in which property besides ministering to the

enjoyment of the few may also furnish the means of the highest culture to all

and will be a greater benefit to the public generally and also more under the

control of public authority there may come a time when the saying have

i not a right to do what i will with my own will appear to be a

barbarous relic of individualismwhen the possession of a part may be a

greater blessing to each and all than the possession of the whole is now to any

one




such reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical statesman but

they are within the range of possibility to the philosopher he can imagine

that in some distant age or clime and through the influence of some

individual the notion of common property may or might have sunk as deep into

the heart of a race and have become as fixed to them as private property is

to ourselves he knows that this latter institution is not more than four or

five thousand years old may not the end revert to the beginning in our own

age even utopias affect the spirit of legislation and an abstract idea may

exercise a great influence on practical politics




the objections that would be generally urged against platos community of

property are the old ones of aristotle that motives for exertion would be

taken away and that disputes would arise when each was dependent upon all

every man would produce as little and consume as much as he liked the

experience of civilized nations has hitherto been adverse to socialism the

effort is too great for human nature men try to live in common but the

personal feeling is always breaking in on the other hand it may be doubted

whether our present notions of property are not conventional for they differ

in different countries and in different states of society we boast of an

individualism which is not freedom but rather an artificial result of the

industrial state of modern europe the individual is nominally free but he is

also powerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chains of economic

necessity even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become

disinterested at any rate we observe in them a power of organization which

fifty years ago would never have been suspected the same forces which have

revolutionized the political system of europe may effect a similar change in

the social and industrial relations of mankind and if we suppose the influence

of some good as well as neutral motives working in the community there will be

no absurdity in expecting that the mass of mankind having power and becoming

enlightened about the higher possibilities of human life when they learn how

much more is attainable for all than is at present the possession of a favoured

few may pursue the common interest with an intelligence and persistency which

mankind have hitherto never seen




now that the world has once been set in motion and is no longer held fast

under the tyranny of custom and ignorance now that criticism has pierced the

veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the presentthe

progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater and swifter than

heretofore even at our present rate of speed the point at which we may arrive

in two or three generations is beyond the power of imagination to foresee

there are forces in the world which work not in an arithmetical but in a

geometrical ratio of increase education to use the expression of plato moves

like a wheel with an evermultiplying rapidity nor can we say how great may be

its influence when it becomes universalwhen it has been inherited by

many generationswhen it is freed from the trammels of superstition and

rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes of men and

women neither do we know how much more the cooperation of minds or of hands

may be capable of accomplishing whether in labour or in study the resources

of the natural sciences are not halfdeveloped as yet the soil of the earth

instead of growing more barren may become many times more fertile than

hitherto the uses of machinery far greater and also more minute than at

present new secrets of physiology may be revealed deeply affecting human

nature in its innermost recesses the standard of health may be raised and the

lives of men prolonged by sanitary and medical knowledge there may be peace

there may be leisure there may be innocent refreshments of many kinds the

everincreasing power of locomotion may join the extremes of earth there may

be mysterious workings of the human mind such as occur only at great crises of

history the east and the west may meet together and all nations may

contribute their thoughts and their experience to the common stock of humanity

many other elements enter into a speculation of this kind but it is better to

make an end of them for such reflections appear to the majority farfetched

and to men of science commonplace




b neither to the mind of plato nor of aristotle did the doctrine of community

of property present at all the same difficulty or appear to be the same

violation of the common hellenic sentiment as the community of wives and

children this paradox he prefaces by another proposal that the occupations of

men and women shall be the same and that to this end they shall have a common

training and education male and female animals have the same

pursuitswhy not also the two sexes of man




but have we not here fallen into a contradiction for we were saying that

different natures should have different pursuits how then can men and women

have the same and is not the proposal inconsistent with our notion of the

division of labourthese objections are no sooner raised than answered

for according to plato there is no organic difference between men and women

but only the accidental one that men beget and women bear children following

the analogy of the other animals he contends that all natural gifts are

scattered about indifferently among both sexes though there may be a

superiority of degree on the part of the men the objection on the score of

decency to their taking part in the same gymnastic exercises is met by

platos assertion that the existing feeling is a matter of habit




that plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own country

and from the example of the east shows a wonderful independence of mind he is

conscious that women are half the human race in some respects the more

important half laws and for the sake both of men and women he desires to

raise the woman to a higher level of existence he brings not sentiment but

philosophy to bear upon a question which both in ancient and modern times has

been chiefly regarded in the light of custom or feeling the greeks had noble

conceptions of womanhood in the goddesses athene and artemis and in the

heroines antigone and andromache but these ideals had no counterpart in actual

life the athenian woman was in no way the equal of her husband she was not

the entertainer of his guests or the mistress of his house but only his

housekeeper and the mother of his children she took no part in military or

political matters nor is there any instance in the later ages of greece of a

woman becoming famous in literature hers is the greatest glory who has

the least renown among men is the historians conception of

feminine excellence a very different ideal of womanhood is held up by plato to

the world she is to be the companion of the man and to share with him in the

toils of war and in the cares of government she is to be similarly trained

both in bodily and mental exercises she is to lose as far as possible the

incidents of maternity and the characteristics of the female sex




the modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the

differences between men and women are not confined to the single point urged by

plato that sensibility gentleness grace are the qualities of women while

energy strength higher intelligence are to be looked for in men and the

criticism is just the differences affect the whole nature and are not as

plato supposes confined to a single point but neither can we say how far

these differences are due to education and the opinions of mankind or

physically inherited from the habits and opinions of former generations women

have been always taught not exactly that they are slaves but that they are in

an inferior position which is also supposed to have compensating advantages

and to this position they have conformed it is also true that the physical

form may easily change in the course of generations through the mode of life

and the weakness or delicacy which was once a matter of opinion may become a

physical fact the characteristics of sex vary greatly in different countries

and ranks of society and at different ages in the same individuals plato may

have been right in denying that there was any ultimate difference in the sexes

of man other than that which exists in animals because all other differences

may be conceived to disappear in other states of society or under different

circumstances of life and training




the first wave having been passed we proceed to the secondcommunity of

wives and children is it possible is it desirable for as

glaucon intimates and as we far more strongly insist great doubts may

be entertained about both these points any free discussion of the

question is impossible and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing the

ultimate bases of social life to be examined few of us can safely enquire into

the things which nature hides any more than we can dissect our own bodies

still the manner in which plato arrived at his conclusions should be

considered for here as mr grote has remarked is a wonderful thing that one

of the wisest and best of men should have entertained ideas of morality which

are wholly at variance with our own and if we would do plato justice we must

examine carefully the character of his proposals first we may observe that

the relations of the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious he

seems rather to aim at an impossible strictness secondly he conceives the

family to be the natural enemy of the state and he entertains the serious hope

that an universal brotherhood may take the place of private interestsan

aspiration which although not justified by experience has possessed many

noble minds on the other hand there is no sentiment or imagination in the

connections which men and women are supposed by him to form human beings

return to the level of the animals neither exalting to heaven nor yet abusing

the natural instincts all that world of poetry and fancy which the passion of

love has called forth in modern literature and romance would have been banished

by plato the arrangements of marriage in the republic are directed to one

objectthe improvement of the race in successive generations a great

development both of bodily and mental qualities might be possible the analogy

of animals tends to show that mankind can within certain limits receive a

change of nature and as in animals we should commonly choose the best for

breeding and destroy the others so there must be a selection made of the

human beings whose lives are worthy to be preserved




we start back horrified from this platonic ideal in the belief first that

the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed out secondly

that if the plan could be carried into execution we should be poorly

recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss of the best things in

life the greatest regard for the weakest and meanest of human beingsthe

infant the criminal the insane the idiot truly seems to us one of the

noblest results of christianity we have learned though as yet imperfectly

that the individual man has an endless value in the sight of god and that we

honour him when we honour the darkened and disfigured image of him laws this

is the lesson which christ taught in a parable when he said their

angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven such

lessons are only partially realized in any age they were foreign to the age of

plato as they have very different degrees of strength in different countries

or ages of the christian world to the greek the family was a religious and

customary institution binding the members together by a tie inferior in

strength to that of friendship and having a less solemn and sacred sound than

that of country the relationship which existed on the lower level of custom

plato imagined that he was raising to the higher level of nature and reason

while from the modern and christian point of view we regard him as sanctioning

murder and destroying the first principles of morality




the great error in these and similar speculations is that the difference

between man and the animals is forgotten in them the human being is regarded

with the eye of a dog or birdfancier or at best of a slaveowner the higher

or human qualities are left out the breeder of animals aims chiefly at size or

speed or strength in a few cases at courage or temper most often the fitness

of the animal for food is the great desideratum but mankind are not bred to be

eaten nor yet for their superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing

carts neither does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the

increase of the bones and flesh but in the growth and enlightenment of the

mind hence there must be a marriage of true minds as well as of

bodies of imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts men and

women without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes yet plato takes

away these qualities and puts nothing in their place not even the desire of a

noble offspring since parents are not to know their own children the most

important transaction of social life he who is the idealist philosopher

converts into the most brutal for the pair are to have no relation to one

another except at the hymeneal festival their children are not theirs but

the states nor is any tie of affection to unite them yet here the

analogy of the animals might have saved plato from a gigantic error if he had

not lost sight of his own illustration for the nobler

sort of birds and beasts nourish and protect their offspring and are

faithful to one another




an eminent physiologist thinks it worth while to try and place life on a

physical basis but should not life rest on the moral rather than upon

the physical the higher comes first then the lower first the human and

rational afterwards the animal yet they are not absolutely divided and in

times of sickness or moments of selfindulgence they seem to be only different

aspects of a common human nature which includes them both neither is the moral

the limit of the physical but the expansion and enlargement of itthe

highest form which the physical is capable of receiving as plato would say

the body does not take care of the body and still less of the mind but the

mind takes care of both in all human action not that which is common to man

and the animals is the characteristic element but that which distinguishes him

from them even if we admit the physical basis and resolve all virtue into

health of body la facon que notre sang circule still on merely

physical grounds we must come back to ideas mind and reason and duty and

conscience under these or other names are always reappearing there cannot be

health of body without health of mind nor health of mind without the sense of

duty and the love of truth charm




that the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations about

marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind does indeed

appear surprising yet the wonder is not so much that plato should have

entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are revolting but that he

should have contradicted himself to an extent which is hardly credible falling

in an instant from the heaven of idealism into the crudest animalism rejoicing

in the newly found gift of reflection he appears to have thought out a subject

about which he had better have followed the enlightened feeling of his own age

the general sentiment of hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy the old

poets and in later time the tragedians showed no want of respect for the

family on which much of their religion was based but the example of sparta

and perhaps in some degree the tendency to defy public opinion seems to have

misled him he will make one family out of all the families of the state he

will select the finest specimens of men and women and breed from these only




yet because the illusion is always returning for the animal part of human

nature will from time to time assert itself in the disguise of philosophy as

well as of poetry and also because any departure from established morality

even where this is not intended is apt to be unsettling it may be worth while

to draw out a little more at length the objections to the platonic marriage in

the first place history shows that wherever polygamy has been largely allowed

the race has deteriorated one man to one woman is the law of god and nature

nearly all the civilized peoples of the world at some period before the age of

written records have become monogamists and the step when once taken has

never been retraced the exceptions occurring among brahmins or mahometans or

the ancient persians are of that sort which may be said to prove the rule the

connexions formed between superior and inferior races hardly ever produce a

noble offspring because they are licentious and because the children in such

cases usually despise the mother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed

of them barbarous nations when they are introduced by europeans to vice die

out polygamist peoples either import and adopt children from other countries

or dwindle in numbers or both dynasties and aristocracies which have

disregarded the laws of nature have decreased in numbers and degenerated in

stature mariages de convenance leave their enfeebling stamp on

the offspring of them king lear the marriage of near relations or the

marrying in and in of the same family tends constantly to weakness or idiocy in

the children sometimes assuming the form as they grow older of passionate

licentiousness the common prostitute rarely has any offspring by such

unmistakable evidence is the authority of morality asserted in the relations of

the sexes and so many more elements enter into this mystery than

are dreamed of by plato and some other philosophers




recent enquirers have indeed arrived at the conclusion that among primitive

tribes there existed a community of wives as of property and that the captive

taken by the spear was the only wife or slave whom any man was permitted to

call his own the partial existence of such customs among some of the lower

races of man and the survival of peculiar ceremonies in the marriages of some

civilized nations are thought to furnish a proof of similar institutions

having been once universal there can be no question that the study of

anthropology has considerably changed our views respecting the first appearance

of man upon the earth we know more about the aborigines of the world than

formerly but our increasing knowledge shows above all things how little we

know with all the helps which written monuments afford we do but faintly

realize the condition of man two thousand or three thousand years ago of what

his condition was when removed to a distance  or  years when the

majority of mankind were lower and nearer the animals than any tribe now

existing upon the earth we cannot even entertain conjecture plato laws and

aristotle metaph may have been more right than we imagine in supposing that

some forms of civilisation were discovered and lost several times over if we

cannot argue that all barbarism is a degraded civilization neither can we set

any limits to the depth of degradation to which the human race may sink through

war disease or isolation and if we are to draw inferences about the origin

of marriage from the practice of barbarous nations we should also consider the

remoter analogy of the animals many birds and animals especially the

carnivorous have only one mate and the love and care of offspring which seems

to be natural is inconsistent with the primitive theory of marriage if we go

back to an imaginary state in which men were almost animals and the companions

of them we have as much right to argue from what is animal to what is human as

from the barbarous to the civilized man the record of animal life on the globe

is fragmentarythe connecting links are wanting and cannot be supplied

the record of social life is still more fragmentary and precarious even if we

admit that our first ancestors had no such institution as marriage still the

stages by which men passed from outer barbarism to the comparative civilization

of china assyria and greece or even of the ancient germans are wholly

unknown to us




such speculations are apt to be unsettling because they seem to show that an

institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven is only the

growth of history and experience we ask what is the origin of marriage and we

are told that like the right of property after many wars and contests it has

gradually arisen out of the selfishness of barbarians we stand face to face

with human nature in its primitive nakedness we are compelled to accept not

the highest but the lowest account of the origin of human society but on the

other hand we may truly say that every step in human progress has been in the

same direction and that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of the

family has been more and more defined and consecrated the civilized east is

immeasurably in advance of any savage tribes the greeks and romans have

improved upon the east the christian nations have been stricter in their views

of the marriage relation than any of the ancients in this as in so many other

things instead of looking back with regret to the past we should look forward

with hope to the future we must consecrate that which we believe to be the

most holy and that which is the most holy will be the most

useful there is more reason for maintaining the sacredness of the

marriage tie when we see the benefit of it than when we only felt a vague

religious horror about the violation of it but in all times of transition

when established beliefs are being undermined there is a danger that in the

passage from the old to the new we may insensibly let go the moral principle

finding an excuse for listening to the voice of passion in the uncertainty of

knowledge or the fluctuations of opinion and there are many persons in our

own day who enlightened by the study of anthropology and fascinated by what

is new and strange some using the language of fear others of hope are

inclined to believe that a time will come when through the selfassertion of

women or the rebellious spirit of children by the analysis of human

relations or by the force of outward circumstances the ties of family life

may be broken or greatly relaxed they point to societies in america and

elsewhere which tend to show that the destruction of the family need not

necessarily involve the overthrow of all morality wherever we may think of

such speculations we can hardly deny that they have been more rife in this

generation than in any other and whither they are tending who can predict




to the doubts and queries raised by these social reformers

respecting the relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man there is a

sufficient answer if any is needed the difference about them and us is really

one of fact they are speaking of man as they wish or fancy him to be but we

are speaking of him as he is they isolate the animal part of his nature we

regard him as a creature having many sides or aspects moving between good and

evil striving to rise above himself and to become a little lower than

the angels we also to use a platonic formula are not ignorant of the

dissatisfactions and incompatibilities of family life of the meannesses of

trade of the flatteries of one class of society by another of the impediments

which the family throws in the way of lofty aims and aspirations but we are

conscious that there are evils and dangers in the background greater still

which are not appreciated because they are either concealed or suppressed

what a condition of man would that be in which human passions were controlled

by no authority divine or human in which there was no shame or decency no

higher affection overcoming or sanctifying the natural instincts but simply a

rule of health is it for this that we are asked to throw away the civilization

which is the growth of ages




for strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired there are the

more important considerations of mind and character and soul we know how human

nature may be degraded we do not know how by artificial means any improvement

in the breed can be effected the problem is a complex one for if we go back

only four steps and these at least enter into the composition of a child

there are commonly thirty progenitors to be taken into account many curious

facts rarely admitting of proof are told us respecting the inheritance of

disease or character from a remote ancestor we can trace the physical

resemblances of parents and children in the same family




sic oculos sic ille manus sic ora ferebat




but scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both from

their parents and from one another we are told of similar mental peculiarities

running in families and again of a tendency as in the animals to revert to a

common or original stock but we have a difficulty in distinguishing what is a

true inheritance of genius or other qualities and what is mere imitation or

the result of similar circumstances great men and great women have rarely had

great fathers and mothers nothing that we know of in the circumstances of

their birth or lineage will explain their appearance of the english poets of

the last and two preceding centuries scarcely a descendant remainsnone

have ever been distinguished so deeply has nature hidden her secret and so

ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained by some that we might in

time by suitable marriage arrangements or as plato would have said by

an ingenious system of lots produce a shakespeare or a milton even

supposing that we could breed men having the tenacity of bulldogs or like the

spartans lacking the wit to run away in battle would the world

be any the better many of the noblest specimens of the human race have been

among the weakest physically tyrtaeus or aesop or our own newton would have

been exposed at sparta and some of the fairest and strongest men and women

have been among the wickedest and worst not by the platonic device of uniting

the strong and fair with the strong and fair regardless of sentiment and

morality nor yet by his other device of combining dissimilar natures

statesman have mankind gradually passed from the brutality and

licentiousness of primitive marriage to marriage christian and civilized




few persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of mental

and physical qualities derived first from our parents or through them from

some remoter ancestor secondly from our race thirdly from the general

condition of mankind into which we are born nothing is commoner than the

remark that so and so is like his father or his uncle and an

aged person may not unfrequently note a resemblance in a youth to a

longforgotten ancestor observing that nature sometimes skips a

generation it may be true also that if we knew more about our

ancestors these similarities would be even more striking to us admitting the

facts which are thus described in a popular way we may however remark that

there is no method of difference by which they can be defined or estimated and

that they constitute only a small part of each individual the doctrine of

heredity may seem to take out of our hands the conduct of our own lives but it

is the idea not the fact which is really terrible to us for what we have

received from our ancestors is only a fraction of what we are or may become

the knowledge that drunkenness or insanity has been prevalent in a family may

be the best safeguard against their recurrence in a future generation the

parent will be most awake to the vices or diseases in his child of which he is

most sensible within himself the whole of life may be directed to their

prevention or cure the traces of consumption may become fainter or be wholly

effaced the inherent tendency to vice or crime may be eradicated and so

heredity from being a curse may become a blessing we acknowledge that in the

matter of our birth as in our nature generally there are previous

circumstances which affect us but upon this platform of circumstances or

within this wall of necessity we have still the power of creating a life for

ourselves by the informing energy of the human will




there is another aspect of the marriage question to which plato is a stranger

all the children born in his state are foundlings it never occurred to him

that the greater part of them according to universal experience would have

perished for children can only be brought up in families there is a subtle

sympathy between the mother and the child which cannot be supplied by other

mothers or by strong nurses one or more laws if platos

pen was as fatal as the creches of paris or the foundling

hospital of dublin more than ninetenths of his children would have perished

there would have been no need to expose or put out of the way the weaklier

children for they would have died of themselves so emphatically does nature

protest against the destruction of the family




what plato had heard or seen of sparta was applied by him in a mistaken way to

his ideal commonwealth he probably observed that both the spartan men and

women were superior in form and strength to the other greeks and this

superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws and customs relating to

marriage he did not consider that the desire of a noble offspring was a

passion among the spartans or that their physical superiority was to be

attributed chiefly not to their marriage customs but to their temperance and

training he did not reflect that sparta was great not in consequence of the

relaxation of morality but in spite of it by virtue of a political principle

stronger far than existed in any other grecian state least of all did he

observe that sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of the greek

race the genius the political inspiration of athens the love of

libertyall that has made greece famous with posterity were wanting

among the spartans they had no themistocles or pericles or aeschylus or

sophocles or socrates or plato the individual was not allowed to appear

above the state the laws were fixed and he had no business to alter or reform

them yet whence has the progress of cities and nations arisen if not from

remarkable individuals coming into the world we know not how and from causes

over which we have no control something too much may have been said in modern

times of the value of individuality but we can hardly condemn too strongly a

system which instead of fostering the scattered seeds or sparks of genius and

character tends to smother and extinguish them




still while condemning plato we must acknowledge that neither christianity

nor any other form of religion and society has hitherto been able to cope with

this most difficult of social problems and that the side from which plato

regarded it is that from which we turn away population is the most untameable

force in the political and social world do we not find especially in large

cities that the greatest hindrance to the amelioration of the poor is their

improvidence in marriagea small fault truly if not involving endless

consequences there are whole countries too such as india or nearer home

ireland in which a right solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the

foundation of the happiness of the community there are too many people on a

given space or they marry too early and bring into the world a sickly and

halfdeveloped offspring or owing to the very conditions of their existence

they become emaciated and hand on a similar life to their descendants but who

can oppose the voice of prudence to the mightiest passions of

mankind laws especially when they have been licensed by custom and

religion in addition to the influences of education we seem to require some

new principles of right and wrong in these matters some force of opinion

which may indeed be already heard whispering in private but has never affected

the moral sentiments of mankind in general we unavoidably lose sight of the

principle of utility just in that action of our lives in which we have the

most need of it the influences which we can bring to bear upon this question

are chiefly indirect in a generation or two education emigration

improvements in agriculture and manufactures may have provided the solution

the state physician hardly likes to probe the wound it is beyond his art a

matter which he cannot safely let alone but which he dare not touch




we do but skin and film the ulcerous place




when again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping into the

grave under the ate of some inherited malady and the parents perhaps surviving

them do our minds ever go back silently to that day twentyfive or thirty

years before on which under the fairest auspices amid the rejoicings of

friends and acquaintances a bride and bridegroom joined hands with one

another in making such a reflection we are not opposing physical

considerations to moral but moral to physical we are seeking to make the

voice of reason heard which drives us back from the extravagance of

sentimentalism on common sense the late dr combe is said by his biographer to

have resisted the temptation to marriage because he knew that he was subject

to hereditary consumption one who deserved to be called a man of genius a

friend of my youth was in the habit of wearing a black ribbon on his wrist in

order to remind him that being liable to outbreaks of insanity he must not

give way to the natural impulses of affection he died unmarried in a lunatic

asylum these two little facts suggest the reflection that a very few persons

have done from a sense of duty what the rest of mankind ought to have done

under like circumstances if they had allowed themselves to think of all the

misery which they were about to bring into the world if we could prevent such

marriages without any violation of feeling or propriety we clearly ought and

the prohibition in the course of time would be protected by a horror

naturalis similar to that which in all civilized ages and countries

has prevented the marriage of near relations by blood mankind would have been

the happier if some things which are now allowed had from the beginning been

denied to them if the sanction of religion could have prohibited practices

inimical to health if sanitary principles could in early ages have been

invested with a superstitious awe but living as we do far on in the

worlds history we are no longer able to stamp at once with the impress

of religion a new prohibition a free agent cannot have his fancies regulated

by law and the execution of the law would be rendered impossible owing to the

uncertainty of the cases in which marriage was to be forbidden who can weigh

virtue or even fortune against health or moral and mental qualities against

bodily who can measure probabilities against certainties there has been some

good as well as evil in the discipline of suffering and there are diseases

such as consumption which have exercised a refining and softening influence on

the character youth is too inexperienced to balance such nice considerations

parents do not often think of them or think of them too late they are at a

distance and may probably be averted change of place a new state of life the

interests of a home may be the cure of them so persons vainly reason when

their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably linked together

nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages are to any great extent

influenced by reflections of this sort which seem unable to make any head

against the irresistible impulse of individual attachment




lastly no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions in

youth the difficulty of regulating them and the effects on the whole mind and

nature which follow from them the stimulus which is given to them by the

imagination without feeling that there is something unsatisfactory in our

method of treating them that the most important influence on human life should

be wholly left to chance or shrouded in mystery and instead of being

disciplined or understood should be required to conform only to an external

standard of proprietycannot be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or

satisfactory condition of human things and still those who have the charge of

youth may find a way by watchfulness by affection by the manliness and

innocence of their own lives by occasional hints by general admonitions which

every one can apply for himself to mitigate this terrible evil which eats out

the heart of individuals and corrupts the moral sentiments of nations in no

duty towards others is there more need of reticence and selfrestraint so

great is the danger lest he who would be the counsellor of another should

reveal the secret prematurely lest he should get another too much into his

power or fix the passing impression of evil by demanding the confession of it




nor is plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere with

higher aims if there have been some who to party gave up what was meant

for mankind there have certainly been others who to family gave up what

was meant for mankind or for their country the cares of children the

necessity of procuring money for their support the flatteries of the rich by

the poor the exclusiveness of caste the pride of birth or wealth the

tendency of family life to divert men from the pursuit of the ideal or the

heroic are as lowering in our own age as in that of plato and if we prefer to

look at the gentle influences of home the development of the affections the

amenities of society the devotion of one member of a family for the good of

the others which form one side of the picture we must not quarrel with him

or perhaps ought rather to be grateful to him for having presented to us the

reverse without attempting to defend plato on grounds of morality we may

allow that there is an aspect of the world which has not unnaturally led him

into error




we hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the state like all other

abstract ideas exercised over the mind of plato to us the state seems to be

built up out of the family or sometimes to be the framework in which family

and social life is contained but to plato in his present mood of mind the

family is only a disturbing influence which instead of filling up tends to

disarrange the higher unity of the state no organization is needed except a

political which regarded from another point of view is a military one the

state is allsufficing for the wants of man and like the idea of the church

in later ages absorbs all other desires and affections in time of war the

thousand citizens are to stand like a rampart impregnable against the world or

the persian host in time of peace the preparation for war and their duties to

the state which are also their duties to one another take up their whole life

and time the only other interest which is allowed to them besides that of war

is the interest of philosophy when they are too old to be soldiers they are to

retire from active life and to have a second novitiate of study and

contemplation there is an element of monasticism even in platos

communism if he could have done without children he might have converted his

republic into a religious order neither in the laws when the daylight of

common sense breaks in upon him does he retract his error in the state of

which he would be the founder there is no marrying or giving in marriage but

because of the infirmity of mankind he condescends to allow the law of nature

to prevail




c but plato has an equal or in his own estimation even greater paradox in

reserve which is summed up in the famous text until kings are

philosophers or philosophers are kings cities will never cease from

ill and by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who are

capable of apprehending ideas especially the idea of good to the attainment

of this higher knowledge the second education is directed through a process of

training which has already made them good citizens they are now to be made good

legislators we find with some surprise not unlike the feeling which aristotle

in a wellknown passage describes the hearers of platos lectures as

experiencing when they went to a discourse on the idea of good expecting to

be instructed in moral truths and received instead of them arithmetical and

mathematical formulae that plato does not propose for his future legislators

any study of finance or law or military tactics but only of abstract

mathematics as a preparation for the still more abstract conception of good

we ask with aristotle what is the use of a man knowing the idea of good if

he does not know what is good for this individual this state this condition

of society we cannot understand how platos legislators or guardians are

to be fitted for their work of statesmen by the study of the five mathematical

sciences we vainly search in platos own writings for any explanation of

this seeming absurdity




the discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the mind with

a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power of estimating its value

no metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly criticised his own speculations in

his own judgment they have been above criticism nor has he understood that

what to him seemed to be absolute truth may reappear in the next generation as

a form of logic or an instrument of thought and posterity have also sometimes

equally misapprehended the real value of his speculations they appear to them

to have contributed nothing to the stock of human knowledge the idea of good

is apt to be regarded by the modern thinker as an unmeaning abstraction but he

forgets that this abstraction is waiting ready for use and will hereafter be

filled up by the divisions of knowledge when mankind do not as yet know that

the world is subject to law the introduction of the mere conception of law or

design or final cause and the faroff anticipation of the harmony of

knowledge are great steps onward even the crude generalization of the unity

of all things leads men to view the world with different eyes and may easily

affect their conception of human life and of politics and also their own

conduct and character tim we can imagine how a great mind like that of

pericles might derive elevation from his intercourse with anaxagoras phaedr

to be struggling towards a higher but unattainable conception is a more

favourable intellectual condition than to rest satisfied in a narrow portion of

ascertained fact and the earlier which have sometimes been the greater ideas

of science are often lost sight of at a later period how rarely can we say of

any modern enquirer in the magnificent language of plato that he is the

spectator of all time and of all existence




nor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast

metaphysical conceptions to practical and political life in the first

enthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them everywhere and to apply them in

the most remote sphere they do not understand that the experience of ages is

required to enable them to fill up the intermediate axioms plato

himself seems to have imagined that the truths of psychology like those of

astronomy and harmonics would be arrived at by a process of deduction and

that the method which he has pursued in the fourth book of inferring them from

experience and the use of language was imperfect and only provisional but

when after having arrived at the idea of good which is the end of the science

of dialectic he is asked what is the nature and what are the divisions of

the science he refuses to answer as if intending by the refusal to intimate

that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as would allow the

philosopher to enter into his final rest the previous sciences must first be

studied and will we may add continue to be studied tell the end of time

although in a sense different from any which plato could have conceived but we

may observe that while he is aware of the vacancy of his own ideal he is full

of enthusiasm in the contemplation of it looking into the orb of light he

sees nothing but he is warmed and elevated the hebrew prophet believed that

faith in god would enable him to govern the world the greek philosopher

imagined that contemplation of the good would make a legislator there is as

much to be filled up in the one case as in the other and the one mode of

conception is to the israelite what the other is to the greek both find a

repose in a divine perfection which whether in a more personal or impersonal

form exists without them and independently of them as well as within them




there is no mention of the idea of good in the timaeus nor of the divine

creator of the world in the republic and we are naturally led to ask in what

relation they stand to one another is god above or below the idea of good or

is the idea of good another mode of conceiving god the latter appears to be

the truer answer to the greek philosopher the perfection and unity of god was

a far higher conception than his personality which he hardly found a word to

express and which to him would have seemed to be borrowed from mythology to

the christian on the other hand or to the modern thinker in general it is

difficult if not impossible to attach reality to what he terms mere

abstraction while to plato this very abstraction is the truest and most real

of all things hence from a difference in forms of thought plato appears to

be resting on a creation of his own mind only but if we may be allowed to

paraphrase the idea of good by the words intelligent principle of law

and order in the universe embracing equally man and nature we begin to

find a meetingpoint between him and ourselves




the question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is one that

has not lost interest in modern times in most countries of europe and asia

there has been some one in the course of ages who has truly united the power of

command with the power of thought and reflection as there have been also many

false combinations of these qualities some kind of speculative power is

necessary both in practical and political life like the rhetorician in the

phaedrus men require to have a conception of the varieties of human character

and to be raised on great occasions above the commonplaces of ordinary life

yet the idea of the philosopherstatesman has never been popular with the mass

of mankind partly because he cannot take the world into his confidence or make

them understand the motives from which he acts and also because they are

jealous of a power which they do not understand the revolution which human

nature desires to effect step by step in many ages is likely to be precipitated

by him in a single year or life they are afraid that in the pursuit of his

greater aims he may disregard the common feelings of humanity he is too apt to

be looking into the distant future or back into the remote past and unable to

see actions or events which to use an expression of platos are

tumbling out at his feet besides as plato would say there are other

corruptions of these philosophical statesmen either the native hue of

resolution is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought and at

the moment when action above all things is required he is undecided or general

principles are enunciated by him in order to cover some change of policy or

his ignorance of the world has made him more easily fall a prey to the arts of

others or in some cases he has been converted into a courtier who enjoys the

luxury of holding liberal opinions but was never known to perform a liberal

action no wonder that mankind have been in the habit of calling statesmen of

this class pedants sophisters doctrinaires visionaries for as we may be

allowed to say a little parodying the words of plato they have seen

bad imitations of the philosopherstatesman but a man in whom the power

of thought and action are perfectly balanced equal to the present reaching

forward to the future such a one ruling in a constitutional

state they have never seen




but as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life so the

ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises when the face

of the world is beginning to alter and thunder is heard in the distance he is

still guided by his old maxims and is the slave of his inveterate party

prejudices he cannot perceive the signs of the times instead of looking

forward he looks back he learns nothing and forgets nothing with wise

saws and modern instances he would stem the rising tide of revolution

he lives more and more within the circle of his own party as the world without

him becomes stronger this seems to be the reason why the old order of things

makes so poor a figure when confronted with the new why churches can never

reform why most political changes are made blindly and convulsively the great

crises in the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical

positiveness and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which have lost

their hold upon a nation the fixed ideas of a reactionary statesman may be

compared to madness they grow upon him and he becomes possessed by them no

judgement of others is ever admitted by him to be weighed in the balance

against his own




d plato labouring under what to modern readers appears to have been a

confusion of ideas assimilates the state to the individual and fails to

distinguish ethics from politics he thinks that to be most of a state which is

most like one man and in which the citizens have the greatest uniformity of

character he does not see that the analogy is partly fallacious and that the

will or character of a state or nation is really the balance or rather the

surplus of individual wills which are limited by the condition of having to

act in common the movement of a body of men can never have the pliancy or

facility of a single man the freedom of the individual which is always

limited becomes still more straitened when transferred to a nation the powers

of action and feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they are

diffused through a community whence arises the often discussed question

can a nation like an individual have a conscience we hesitate

to say that the characters of nations are nothing more than the sum of the

characters of the individuals who compose them because there may be tendencies

in individuals which react upon one another a whole nation may be wiser than

any one man in it or may be animated by some common opinion or feeling which

could not equally have affected the mind of a single person or may have been

inspired by a leader of genius to perform acts more than human plato does not

appear to have analysed the complications which arise out of the collective

action of mankind neither is he capable of seeing that analogies though

specious as arguments may often have no foundation in fact or of

distinguishing between what is intelligible or vividly present to the mind and

what is true in this respect he is far below aristotle who is comparatively

seldom imposed upon by false analogies he cannot disentangle the arts from the

virtuesat least he is always arguing from one to the other his notion

of music is transferred from harmony of sounds to harmony of life in this he

is assisted by the ambiguities of language as well as by the prevalence of

pythagorean notions and having once assimilated the state to the individual

he imagines that he will find the succession of states paralleled in the lives

of individuals




still through this fallacious medium a real enlargement of ideas is attained

when the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to the mind a great

advance was made by the comparison of them with the arts for virtue is partly

art and has an outward form as well as an inward principle the harmony of

music affords a lively image of the harmonies of the world and of human life

and may be regarded as a splendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for

a real analogy in the same way the identification of ethics with politics has

a tendency to give definiteness to ethics and also to elevate and ennoble

mens notions of the aims of government and of the duties of citizens

for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an idealized law and

politics and politics as ethics reduced to the conditions of human society

there have been evils which have arisen out of the attempt to identify them

and this has led to the separation or antagonism of them which has been

introduced by modern political writers but we may likewise feel that something

has been lost in their separation and that the ancient philosophers who

estimated the moral and intellectual wellbeing of mankind first and the wealth

of nations and individuals second may have a salutary influence on the

speculations of modern times many political maxims originate in a reaction

against an opposite error and when the errors against which they were directed

have passed away they in turn become errors




 platos views of education are in several respects remarkable like

the rest of the republic they are partly greek and partly ideal beginning with

the ordinary curriculum of the greek youth and extending to afterlife plato

is the first writer who distinctly says that education is to comprehend the

whole of life and to be a preparation for another in which education begins

again this is the continuous thread which runs through the republic and which

more than any other of his ideas admits of an application to modern life




he has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught and he is

disposed to modify the thesis of the protagoras that the virtues are one and

not many he is not unwilling to admit the sensible world into his scheme of

truth nor does he assert in the republic the involuntariness of vice which is

maintained by him in the timaeus sophist and laws protag apol gorg

nor do the socalled platonic ideas recovered from a former state of existence

affect his theory of mental improvement still we observe in him the remains of

the old socratic doctrine that true knowledge must be elicited from within

and is to be sought for in ideas not in particulars of sense education as he

says will implant a principle of intelligence which is better than ten

thousand eyes the paradox that the virtues are one and the kindred notion

that all virtue is knowledge are not entirely renounced the first is seen in

the supremacy given to justice over the rest the second in the tendency to

absorb the moral virtues in the intellectual and to centre all goodness in the

contemplation of the idea of good the world of sense is still depreciated and

identified with opinion though admitted to be a shadow of the true in the

republic he is evidently impressed with the conviction that vice arises chiefly

from ignorance and may be cured by education the multitude are hardly to be

deemed responsible for what they do a faint allusion to the doctrine of

reminiscence occurs in the tenth book but platos views of education

have no more real connection with a previous state of existence than our own

he only proposes to elicit from the mind that which is there already education

is represented by him not as the filling of a vessel but as the turning the

eye of the soul towards the light




he treats first of music or literature which he divides into true and false

and then goes on to gymnastics of infancy in the republic he takes no notice

though in the laws he gives sage counsels about the nursing of children and the

management of the mothers and would have an education which is even prior to

birth but in the republic he begins with the age at which the child is capable

of receiving ideas and boldly asserts in language which sounds paradoxical to

modern ears that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true the

modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth and

falsehood the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact the other

with ideas this is the difference between ourselves and plato which is

however partly a difference of words for we too should admit that a child

must receive many lessons which he imperfectly understands he must be taught

some things in a figure only some too which he can hardly be expected to

believe when he grows older but we should limit the use of fiction by the

necessity of the case plato would draw the line differently according to him

the aim of early education is not truth as a matter of fact but truth as a

matter of principle the child is to be taught first simple religious truths

and then simple moral truths and insensibly to learn the lesson of good

manners and good taste he would make an entire reformation of the old

mythology like xenophanes and heracleitus he is sensible of the deep chasm

which separates his own age from homer and hesiod whom he quotes and invests

with an imaginary authority but only for his own purposes the lusts and

treacheries of the gods are to be banished the terrors of the world below are

to be dispelled the misbehaviour of the homeric heroes is not to be a model

for youth but there is another strain heard in homer which may teach our youth

endurance and something may be learnt in medicine from the simple practice of

the homeric age the principles on which religion is to be based are two only

first that god is true secondly that he is good modern and christian

writers have often fallen short of these they can hardly be said to have gone

beyond them




the young are to be brought up in happy surroundings out of the way of sights

or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste they are to live

in an atmosphere of health the breeze is always to be wafting to them the

impressions of truth and goodness could such an education be realized or if

our modern religious education could be bound up with truth and virtue and good

manners and good taste that would be the best hope of human improvement

plato like ourselves is looking forward to changes in the moral and religious

world and is preparing for them he recognizes the danger of unsettling young

mens minds by sudden changes of laws and principles by destroying the

sacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their place

he is afraid too of the influence of the drama on the ground that it

encourages false sentiment and therefore he would not have his children taken

to the theatre he thinks that the effect on the spectators is bad and on the

actors still worse his idea of education is that of harmonious growth in

which are insensibly learnt the lessons of temperance and endurance and the

body and mind develope in equal proportions the first principle which runs

through all art and nature is simplicity this also is to be the rule of human

life




the second stage of education is gymnastic which answers to the period of

muscular growth and development the simplicity which is enforced in music is

extended to gymnastic plato is aware that the training of the body may be

inconsistent with the training of the mind and that bodily exercise may be

easily overdone excessive training of the body is apt to give men a headache

or to render them sleepy at a lecture on philosophy and this they attribute

not to the true cause but to the nature of the subject two points are

noticeable in platos treatment of gymnasticfirst that the time

of training is entirely separated from the time of literary education he seems

to have thought that two things of an opposite and different nature could not

be learnt at the same time here we can hardly agree with him and if we may

judge by experience the effect of spending three years between the ages of

fourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from improving to

the intellect secondly he affirms that music and gymnastic are not as common

opinion is apt to imagine intended the one for the cultivation of the mind

and the other of the body but that they are both equally designed for the

improvement of the mind the body in his view is the servant of the mind the

subjection of the lower to the higher is for the advantage of both and

doubtless the mind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the

body if exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts but

continuously in making preparation for the whole of life other greek writers

saw the mischievous tendency of spartan discipline arist pol thuc but

only plato recognized the fundamental error on which the practice was based




the subject of gymnastic leads plato to the sister subject of medicine which

he further illustrates by the parallel of law the modern disbelief in medicine

has led in this as in some other departments of knowledge to a demand for

greater simplicity physicians are becoming aware that they often make diseases

greater and more complicated by their treatment of them rep

in two thousand years their art has made but slender progress what they have

gained in the analysis of the parts is in a great degree lost by their feebler

conception of the human frame as a whole they have attended more to the cure

of diseases than to the conditions of health and the improvements in medicine

have been more than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training until

lately they have hardly thought of air and water the importance of which was

well understood by the ancients as aristotle remarks air and water

being the elements which we most use have the greatest effect upon

health polit for ages physicians have been under the dominion of

prejudices which have only recently given way and now there are as many

opinions in medicine as in theology and an equal degree of scepticism and some

want of toleration about both plato has several good notions about medicine

according to him the eye cannot be cured without the rest of the body

nor the body without the mind charm no man of sense he says in the

timaeus would take physic and we heartily sympathize with him in the laws

when he declares that the limbs of the rustic worn with toil will derive

more benefit from warm baths than from the prescriptions of a not over wise

doctor but we can hardly praise him when in obedience to the authority

of homer he depreciates diet or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he

would get rid of invalid and useless lives by leaving them to die he does not

seem to have considered that the bridle of theages might be

accompanied by qualities which were of far more value to the state than the

health or strength of the citizens or that the duty of taking care of the

helpless might be an important element of education in a state the physician

himself this is a delicate and subtle observation should not be a man in

robust health he should have in modern phraseology a nervous temperament he

should have experience of disease in his own person in order that his powers

of observation may be quickened in the case of others




the perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law in which

again plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplicity greater

matters are to be determined by the legislator or by the oracle of delphi

lesser matters are to be left to the temporary regulation of the citizens

themselves plato is aware that laissez faire is an important element of

government the diseases of a state are like the heads of a hydra they

multiply when they are cut off the true remedy for them is not extirpation but

prevention and the way to prevent them is to take care of education and

education will take care of all the rest so in modern times men have often

felt that the only political measure worth havingthe only one which

would produce any certain or lasting effect was a measure of national

education and in our own more than in any previous age the necessity has been

recognized of restoring the everincreasing confusion of law to simplicity and

common sense




when the training in music and gymnastic is completed there follows the first

stage of active and public life but soon education is to begin again from a

new point of view in the interval between the fourth and seventh books we have

discussed the nature of knowledge and have thence been led to form a higher

conception of what was required of us for true knowledge according to plato

is of abstractions and has to do not with particulars or individuals but

with universals only not with the beauties of poetry but with the ideas of

philosophy and the great aim of education is the cultivation of the habit of

abstraction this is to be acquired through the study of the mathematical

sciences they alone are capable of giving ideas of relation and of arousing

the dormant energies of thought




mathematics in the age of plato comprehended a very small part of that which is

now included in them but they bore a much larger proportion to the sum of

human knowledge they were the only organon of thought which the human mind at

that time possessed and the only measure by which the chaos of particulars

could be reduced to rule and order the faculty which they trained was

naturally at war with the poetical or imaginative and hence to plato who is

everywhere seeking for abstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of

sense nearly the whole of education is contained in them they seemed to have

an inexhaustible application partly because their true limits were not yet

understood these plato himself is beginning to investigate though not aware

that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense he recognizes that the

forms used by geometry are borrowed from the sensible world he seeks to find

the ultimate ground of mathematical ideas in the idea of good though he does

not satisfactorily explain the connexion between them and in his conception of

the relation of ideas to numbers he falls very far short of the definiteness

attributed to him by aristotle met but if he fails to recognize the true

limits of mathematics he also reaches a point beyond them in his view ideas

of number become secondary to a higher conception of knowledge the

dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the mathematician is above

the ordinary man the one the selfproving the good which is the higher

sphere of dialectic is the perfect truth to which all things ascend and in

which they finally repose




this selfproving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no distinct

explanation can be given relative only to a particular stage in greek

philosophy it is an abstraction under which no individuals are comprehended a

whole which has no parts arist nic eth the vacancy of such a form was

perceived by aristotle but not by plato nor did he recognize that in the

dialectical process are included two or more methods of investigation which are

at variance with each other he did not see that whether he took the longer or

the shorter road no advance could be made in this way and yet such visions

often have an immense effect for although the method of science cannot

anticipate science the idea of science not as it is but as it will be in the

future is a great and inspiring principle in the pursuit of knowledge we are

always pressing forward to something beyond us and as a false conception of

knowledge for example the scholastic philosophy may lead men astray during

many ages so the true ideal though vacant may draw all their thoughts in a

right direction it makes a great difference whether the general expectation of

knowledge as this indefinite feeling may be termed is based upon a sound

judgment for mankind may often entertain a true conception of what knowledge

ought to be when they have but a slender experience of facts the correlation

of the sciences the consciousness of the unity of nature the idea of

classification the sense of proportion the unwillingness to stop short of

certainty or to confound probability with truth are important principles of

the higher education although plato could tell us nothing and perhaps knew

that he could tell us nothing of the absolute truth he has exercised an

influence on the human mind which even at the present day is not exhausted and

political and social questions may yet arise in which the thoughts of plato may

be read anew and receive a fresh meaning




the idea of good is so called only in the republic but there are traces of it

in other dialogues of plato it is a cause as well as an idea and from this

point of view may be compared with the creator of the timaeus who out of his

goodness created all things it corresponds to a certain extent with the modern

conception of a law of nature or of a final cause or of both in one and in

this regard may be connected with the measure and symmetry of the philebus it

is represented in the symposium under the aspect of beauty and is supposed to

be attained there by stages of initiation as here by regular gradations of

knowledge viewed subjectively it is the process or science of dialectic this

is the science which according to the phaedrus is the true basis of rhetoric

which alone is able to distinguish the natures and classes of men and things

which divides a whole into the natural parts and reunites the scattered parts

into a natural or organized whole which defines the abstract essences or

universal ideas of all things and connects them which pierces the veil of

hypotheses and reaches the final cause or first principle of all which regards

the sciences in relation to the idea of good this ideal science is the highest

process of thought and may be described as the soul conversing with herself or

holding communion with eternal truth and beauty and in another form is the

everlasting question and answerthe ceaseless interrogative of socrates

the dialogues of plato are themselves examples of the nature and method of

dialectic viewed objectively the idea of good is a power or cause which makes

the world without us correspond with the world within yet this world without

us is still a world of ideas with plato the investigation of nature is another

department of knowledge and in this he seeks to attain only probable

conclusions timaeus




if we ask whether this science of dialectic which plato only half explains to

us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics the answer is that in his mind the

two sciences are not as yet distinguished any more than the subjective and

objective aspects of the world and of man which german philosophy has revealed

to us nor has he determined whether his science of dialectic is at rest or in

motion concerned with the contemplation of absolute being or with a process

of development and evolution modern metaphysics may be described as the

science of abstractions or as the science of the evolution of thought modern

logic when passing beyond the bounds of mere aristotelian forms may be

defined as the science of method the germ of both of them is contained in the

platonic dialectic all metaphysicians have something in common with the ideas

of plato all logicians have derived something from the method of plato the

nearest approach in modern philosophy to the universal science of plato is to

be found in the hegelian succession of moments in the unity of the

idea plato and hegel alike seem to have conceived the world as the

correlation of abstractions and not impossibly they would have understood one

another better than any of their commentators understand them swifts

voyage to laputa having a desire to see those ancients who were most

renowned for wit and learning i set apart one day on purpose i proposed that

homer and aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but

these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court

and outward rooms of the palace i knew and could distinguish these two

heroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each other homer was

the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erect for one of his

age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing i ever beheld aristotle

stooped much and made use of a staff his visage was meagre his hair lank and

thin and his voice hollow i soon discovered that both of them were perfect

strangers to the rest of the company and had never seen or heard of them

before and i had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless that

these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their

principals in the lower world through a consciousness of shame and guilt

because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of these authors to

posterity i introduced didymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed

on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they

wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotle was out of

all patience with the account i gave him of scotus and ramus as i presented

them to him and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as

great dunces as themselves there is however a difference

between them for whereas hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one

mind which developes the stages of the idea in different countries or at

different times in the same country with plato these gradations are regarded

only as an order of thought or ideas the history of the human mind had not yet

dawned upon him




many criticisms may be made on platos theory of education while in some

respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers in others he is in

advance of them he is opposed to the modes of education which prevailed in his

own time but he can hardly be said to have discovered new ones he does not

see that education is relative to the characters of individuals he only

desires to impress the same form of the state on the minds of all he has no

sufficient idea of the effect of literature on the formation of the mind and

greatly exaggerates that of mathematics his aim is above all things to train

the reasoning faculties to implant in the mind the spirit and power of

abstraction to explain and define general notions and if possible to

connect them no wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers

and at times even he himself should have fallen away from the doctrine of

ideas and have returned to that branch of knowledge in which alone the

relation of the one and many can be truly seenthe science of number in

his views both of teaching and training he might be styled in modern language

a doctrinaire after the spartan fashion he would have his citizens cast in one

mould he does not seem to consider that some degree of freedom a

little wholesome neglect is necessary to strengthen and develope the

character and to give play to the individual nature his citizens would not

have acquired that knowledge which in the vision of er is supposed to be gained

by the pilgrims from their experience of evil




on the other hand plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and

theologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through life and

will begin again in another he would never allow education of some kind to

cease although he was aware that the proverbial saying of solon i grow

old learning many things cannot be applied literally himself ravished

with the contemplation of the idea of good and delighting in solid geometry

rep he has no difficulty in imagining that a lifetime might be passed

happily in such pursuits we who know how many more men of business there are

in the world than real students or thinkers are not equally sanguine the

education which he proposes for his citizens is really the ideal life of the

philosopher or man of genius interrupted but only for a time by practical

dutiesa life not for the many but for the few




yet the thought of plato may not be wholly incapable of application to our own

times even if regarded as an ideal which can never be realized it may have a

great effect in elevating the characters of mankind and raising them above the

routine of their ordinary occupation or profession it is the best form under

which we can conceive the whole of life nevertheless the idea of plato is not

easily put into practice for the education of after life is necessarily the

education which each one gives himself men and women cannot be brought

together in schools or colleges at forty or fifty years of age and if they

could the result would be disappointing the destination of most men is what

plato would call the den for the whole of life and with that

they are content neither have they teachers or advisers with whom they can

take counsel in riper years there is no schoolmaster abroad who

will tell them of their faults or inspire them with the higher sense of duty

or with the ambition of a true success in life no socrates who will convict

them of ignorance no christ or follower of christ who will reprove them of

sin hence they have a difficulty in receiving the first element of

improvement which is selfknowledge the hopes of youth no longer stir them

they rather wish to rest than to pursue high objects a few only who have come

across great men and women or eminent teachers of religion and morality have

received a second life from them and have lighted a candle from the fire of

their genius




the want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons continue to

improve in later years they have not the will and do not know the way they

never try an experiment or look up a point of interest for

themselves they make no sacrifices for the sake of knowledge their minds

like their bodies at a certain age become fixed genius has been defined as

the power of taking pains but hardly any one keeps up his

interest in knowledge throughout a whole life the troubles of a family the

business of making money the demands of a profession destroy the elasticity of

the mind the waxen tablet of the memory which was once capable of receiving

true thoughts and clear impressions becomes hard and crowded

there is not room for the accumulations of a long life theaet the student

as years advance rather makes an exchange of knowledge than adds to his

stores there is no pressing necessity to learn the stock of classics or

history or natural science which was enough for a man at twentyfive is enough

for him at fifty neither is it easy to give a definite answer to any one who

asks how he is to improve for selfeducation consists in a thousand things

commonplace in themselvesin adding to what we are by nature something

of what we are not in learning to see ourselves as others see us in judging

not by opinion but by the evidence of facts in seeking out the society of

superior minds in a study of lives and writings of great men in observation

of the world and character in receiving kindly the natural influence of

different times of life in any act or thought which is raised above the

practice or opinions of mankind in the pursuit of some new or original

enquiry in any effort of mind which calls forth some latent power




if any one is desirous of carrying out in detail the platonic education of

afterlife some such counsels as the following may be offered to

himthat he shall choose the branch of knowledge to which his own mind

most distinctly inclines and in which he takes the greatest delight either

one which seems to connect with his own daily employment or perhaps

furnishes the greatest contrast to it he may study from the speculative side

the profession or business in which he is practically engaged he may make

homer dante shakespeare plato bacon the friends and companions of his life

he may find opportunities of hearing the living voice of a great teacher he

may select for enquiry some point of history or some unexplained phenomenon of

nature an hour a day passed in such scientific or literary pursuits will

furnish as many facts as the memory can retain and will give him a

pleasure not to be repented of timaeus only let him beware of being

the slave of crotchets or of running after a will o the wisp in his

ignorance or in his vanity of attributing to himself the gifts of a poet or

assuming the air of a philosopher he should know the limits of his own powers

better to build up the mind by slow additions to creep on quietly from one

thing to another to gain insensibly new powers and new interests in knowledge

than to form vast schemes which are never destined to be realized but perhaps

as plato would say this is part of another subject tim

though we may also defend our digression by his example theaet




 we remark with surprise that the progress of nations or the natural growth

of institutions which fill modern treatises on political philosophy seem hardly

ever to have attracted the attention of plato and aristotle the ancients were

familiar with the mutability of human affairs they could moralize over the

ruins of cities and the fall of empires plato statesman and sulpicius

letter to cicero by them fate and chance were deemed to be real powers

almost persons and to have had a great share in political events the wiser of

them like thucydides believed that what had been would be again

and that a tolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past also

they had dreams of a golden age which existed once upon a time and might still

exist in some unknown land or might return again in the remote future but the

regular growth of a state enlightened by experience progressing in knowledge

improving in the arts of which the citizens were educated by the fulfilment of

political duties appears never to have come within the range of their hopes

and aspirations such a state had never been seen and therefore could not be

conceived by them their experience aristot metaph plato laws led them to

conclude that there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been

discovered and lost many times over and cities had been overthrown and rebuilt

again and again and deluges and volcanoes and other natural convulsions had

altered the face of the earth tradition told them of many destructions of

mankind and of the preservation of a remnant the world began again after a

deluge and was reconstructed out of the fragments of itself also they were

acquainted with empires of unknown antiquity like the egyptian or assyrian

but they had never seen them grow and could not imagine any more than we can

the state of man which preceded them they were puzzled and awestricken by the

egyptian monuments of which the forms as plato says not in a figure but

literally were ten thousand years old laws and they contrasted the

antiquity of egypt with their own short memories




the early legends of hellas have no real connection with the later history

they are at a distance and the intermediate region is concealed from view

there is no road or path which leads from one to the other at the beginning of

greek history in the vestibule of the temple is seen standing first of all

the figure of the legislator himself the interpreter and servant of the god

the fundamental laws which he gives are not supposed to change with time and

circumstances the salvation of the state is held rather to depend on the

inviolable maintenance of them they were sanctioned by the authority of

heaven and it was deemed impiety to alter them the desire to maintain them

unaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very surprising to

usthe intolerant zeal of plato against innovators in religion or

politics laws although with a happy inconsistency he is also willing that

the laws of other countries should be studied and improvements in legislation

privately communicated to the nocturnal council laws the additions which

were made to them in later ages in order to meet the increasing complexity of

affairs were still ascribed by a fiction to the original legislator and the

words of such enactments at athens were disputed over as if they had been the

words of solon himself plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the mind

of the legislator he would have his citizens remain within the lines which he

has laid down for them he would not harass them with minute regulations he

would have allowed some changes in the laws but not changes which would affect

the fundamental institutions of the state such for example as would convert an

aristocracy into a timocracy or a timocracy into a popular form of government




passing from speculations to facts we observe that progress has been the

exception rather than the law of human history and therefore we are not

surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather than of ancient

date and like the idea of a philosophy of history is not more than a century

or two old it seems to have arisen out of the impression left on the human

mind by the growth of the roman empire and of the christian church and to be

due to the political and social improvements which they introduced into the

world and still more in our own century to the idealism of the first french

revolution and the triumph of american independence and in a yet greater

degree to the vast material prosperity and growth of population in england and

her colonies and in america it is also to be ascribed in a measure to the

greater study of the philosophy of history the optimist temperament of some

great writers has assisted the creation of it while the opposite character has

led a few to regard the future of the world as dark the spectator of

all time and of all existence sees more of the increasing purpose

which through the ages ran than formerly but to the inhabitant of a

small state of hellas the vision was necessarily limited like the valley in

which he dwelt there was no remote past on which his eye could rest nor any

future from which the veil was partly lifted up by the analogy of history the

narrowness of view which to ourselves appears so singular was to him natural

if not unavoidable




 for the relation of the republic to the statesman and the laws and the two

other works of plato which directly treat of politics see the introductions to

the two latter a few general points of comparison may be touched upon in this

place




and first of the laws




 the republic though probably written at intervals yet speaking generally

and judging by the indications of thought and style may be reasonably ascribed

to the middle period of platos life the laws are certainly the work of

his declining years and some portions of them at any rate seem to have been

written in extreme old age




 the republic is full of hope and aspiration the laws bear the stamp of

failure and disappointment the one is a finished work which received the last

touches of the author the other is imperfectly executed and apparently

unfinished the one has the grace and beauty of youth the other has lost the

poetical form but has more of the severity and knowledge of life which is

characteristic of old age




 the most conspicuous defect of the laws is the failure of dramatic power

whereas the republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and oppositions of

character




 the laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon the republic of a

poem the one is more religious the other more intellectual




 many theories of plato such as the doctrine of ideas the government of

the world by philosophers are not found in the laws the immortality of the

soul is first mentioned in xii the person of socrates has altogether

disappeared the community of women and children is renounced the institution

of common or public meals for women laws is for the first time introduced

ar pol




 there remains in the laws the old enmity to the poets who are ironically

saluted in highflown terms and at the same time are peremptorily ordered

out of the city if they are not willing to submit their poems to the

censorship of the magistrates rep




 though the work is in most respects inferior there are a few passages in

the laws such as the honour due to the soul the evils of licentious or

unnatural love the whole of book x religion the dishonesty of retail

trade and bequests which come more home to us and contain more of what may

be termed the modern element in plato than almost anything in the republic




the relation of the two works to one another is very well given




 by aristotle in the politics from the side of the laws




the same or nearly the same objections apply to platos later

work the laws and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution

which is therein described in the republic socrates has definitely settled in

all a few questions only such as the community of women and children the

community of property and the constitution of the state the population is

divided into two classesone of husbandmen and the other of warriors

from this latter is taken a third class of counsellors and rulers of the state

but socrates has not determined whether the husbandmen and artists are to have

a share in the government and whether they too are to carry arms and share in

military service or not he certainly thinks that the women ought to share in

the education of the guardians and to fight by their side the remainder of

the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the main subject and with

discussions about the education of the guardians in the laws there is hardly

anything but laws not much is said about the constitution this which he had

intended to make more of the ordinary type he gradually brings round to the

other or ideal form for with the exception of the community of women and

property he supposes everything to be the same in both states there is to be

the same education the citizens of both are to live free from servile

occupations and there are to be common meals in both the only difference is

that in the laws the common meals are extended to women and the warriors

number about  but in the republic only 




 by plato in the laws book v from the side of the republic




the first and highest form of the state and of the government and of the

law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying that

friends have all things in common whether there is now or ever

will be this communion of women and children and of property in which the

private and individual is altogether banished from life and things which are

by nature private such as eyes and ears and hands have become common and all

men express praise and blame and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions

and the laws unite the city to the utmostwhether all this is possible

or not i say that no man acting upon any other principle will ever

constitute a state more exalted in virtue or truer or better than this such a

state whether inhabited by gods or sons of gods will make them blessed who

dwell therein and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the

state and to cling to this and as far as possible to seek for one which is

like this the state which we have now in hand when created will be nearest

to immortality and unity in the next degree and after that by the grace of

god we will complete the third one and we will begin by speaking of the

nature and origin of the second




the comparatively short work called the statesman or politicus in its style and

manner is more akin to the laws while in its idealism it rather resembles the

republic as far as we can judge by various indications of language and

thought it must be later than the one and of course earlier than the other in

both the republic and statesman a close connection is maintained between

politics and dialectic in the statesman enquiries into the principles of

method are interspersed with discussions about politics the comparative

advantages of the rule of law and of a person are considered and the decision

given in favour of a person arist pol but much may be said on the other

side nor is the opposition necessary for a person may rule by law and law

may be so applied as to be the living voice of the legislator as in the

republic there is a myth describing however not a future but a former

existence of mankind the question is asked whether the state of

innocence which is described in the myth or a state like our own which

possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil is the preferable

condition of man to this question of the comparative happiness of

civilized and primitive life which was so often discussed in the last century

and in our own no answer is given the statesman though less perfect in style

than the republic and of far less range may justly be regarded as one of the

greatest of platos dialogues




 others as well as plato have chosen an ideal republic to be the vehicle of

thoughts which they could not definitely express or which went beyond their

own age the classical writing which approaches most nearly to the republic of

plato is the de republica of cicero but neither in this nor in

any other of his dialogues does he rival the art of plato the manners are

clumsy and inferior the hand of the rhetorician is apparent at every turn yet

noble sentiments are constantly recurring the true note of roman

patriotismwe romans are a great peopleresounds

through the whole work like socrates cicero turns away from the phenomena of

the heavens to civil and political life he would rather not discuss the

two suns of which all rome was talking when he can converse

about the two nations in one which had divided rome ever since

the days of the gracchi like socrates again speaking in the person of scipio

he is afraid lest he should assume too much the character of a teacher rather

than of an equal who is discussing among friends the two sides of a question

he would confine the terms king or state to the rule of reason and justice and

he will not concede that title either to a democracy or to a monarchy but

under the rule of reason and justice he is willing to include the natural

superior ruling over the natural inferior which he compares to the soul ruling

over the body he prefers a mixture of forms of government to any single one

the two portraits of the just and the unjust which occur in the second book of

the republic are transferred to the statephilus one of the

interlocutors maintaining against his will the necessity of injustice as a

principle of government while the other laelius supports the opposite

thesis his views of language and number are derived from plato like him he

denounces the drama he also declares that if his life were to be twice as long

he would have no time to read the lyric poets the picture of democracy is

translated by him word for word though he had hardly shown himself able to

carry the jest of plato he converts into a stately sentence the

humorous fancy about the animals who are so imbued with the spirit of

democracy that they make the passersby get out of their way his

description of the tyrant is imitated from plato but is far inferior the

second book is historical and claims for the roman constitution which is to

him the ideal a foundation of fact such as plato probably intended to have

given to the republic in the critias his most remarkable imitation of plato is

the adaptation of the vision of er which is converted by cicero into the

somnium scipionis he has romanized the myth of the

republic adding an argument for the immortality of the soul taken from the

phaedrus and some other touches derived from the phaedo and the timaeus

though a beautiful tale and containing splendid passages the somnium

scipionis is very inferior to the vision of er it is only a dream and hardly

allows the reader to suppose that the writer believes in his own creation

whether his dialogues were framed on the model of the lost dialogues of

aristotle as he himself tells us or of plato to which they bear many

superficial resemblances he is still the roman orator he is not conversing

but making speeches and is never able to mould the intractable latin to the

grace and ease of the greek platonic dialogue but if he is defective in form

much more is he inferior to the greek in matter he nowhere in his

philosophical writings leaves upon our minds the impression of an original

thinker




platos republic has been said to be a church and not a state and such

an ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the christian world

and is embodied in st augustines de civitate dei which

is suggested by the decay and fall of the roman empire much in the same manner

in which we may imagine the republic of plato to have been influenced by the

decline of greek politics in the writers own age the difference is that

in the time of plato the degeneracy though certain was gradual and

insensible whereas the taking of rome by the goths stirred like an earthquake

the age of st augustine men were inclined to believe that the overthrow of

the city was to be ascribed to the anger felt by the old roman deities at the

neglect of their worship st augustine maintains the opposite thesis he

argues that the destruction of the roman empire is due not to the rise of

christianity but to the vices of paganism he wanders over roman history and

over greek philosophy and mythology and finds everywhere crime impiety and

falsehood he compares the worst parts of the gentile religions with the best

elements of the faith of christ he shows nothing of the spirit which led

others of the early christian fathers to recognize in the writings of the greek

philosophers the power of the divine truth he traces the parallel of the

kingdom of god that is the history of the jews contained in their

scriptures and of the kingdoms of the world which are found in gentile

writers and pursues them both into an ideal future it need hardly be remarked

that his use both of greek and of roman historians and of the sacred writings

of the jews is wholly uncritical the heathen mythology the sybilline oracles

the myths of plato the dreams of neoplatonists are equally regarded by him as

matter of fact he must be acknowledged to be a strictly polemical or

controversial writer who makes the best of everything on one side and the worst

of everything on the other he has no sympathy with the old roman life as plato

has with greek life nor has he any idea of the ecclesiastical kingdom which

was to arise out of the ruins of the roman empire he is not blind to the

defects of the christian church and looks forward to a time when christian and

pagan shall be alike brought before the judgmentseat and the true city of god

shall appearthe work of st augustine is a curious repertory of antiquarian

learning and quotations deeply penetrated with christian ethics but showing

little power of reasoning and a slender knowledge of the greek literature and

language he was a great genius and a noble character yet hardly capable of

feeling or understanding anything external to his own theology of all the

ancient philosophers he is most attracted by plato though he is very slightly

acquainted with his writings he is inclined to believe that the idea of

creation in the timaeus is derived from the narrative in genesis and he is

strangely taken with the coincidence  of platos saying that

the philosopher is the lover of god and the words of the book of

exodus in which god reveals himself to moses exod he dwells at length on

miracles performed in his own day of which the evidence is regarded by him as

irresistible he speaks in a very interesting manner of the beauty and utility

of nature and of the human frame which he conceives to afford a foretaste of

the heavenly state and of the resurrection of the body the book is not really

what to most persons the title of it would imply and belongs to an age which

has passed away but it contains many fine passages and thoughts which are for

all time




the short treatise de monarchia of dante is by far the most remarkable of

mediaeval ideals and bears the impress of the great genius in whom italy and

the middle ages are so vividly reflected it is the vision of an universal

empire which is supposed to be the natural and necessary government of the

world having a divine authority distinct from the papacy yet coextensive with

it it is not the ghost of the dead roman empire sitting crowned upon

the grave thereof but the legitimate heir and successor of it

justified by the ancient virtues of the romans and the beneficence of their

rule their right to be the governors of the world is also confirmed by the

testimony of miracles and acknowledged by st paul when he appealed to caesar

and even more emphatically by christ himself who could not have made atonement

for the sins of men if he had not been condemned by a divinely authorized

tribunal the necessity for the establishment of an universal empire is proved

partly by a priori arguments such as the unity of god and the unity of the

family or nation partly by perversions of scripture and history by false

analogies of nature by misapplied quotations from the classics and by odd

scraps and commonplaces of logic showing a familiar but by no means exact

knowledge of aristotle of plato there is none but a more convincing argument

still is the miserable state of the world which he touchingly describes he

sees no hope of happiness or peace for mankind until all nations of the earth

are comprehended in a single empire the whole treatise shows how deeply the

idea of the roman empire was fixed in the minds of his contemporaries not much

argument was needed to maintain the truth of a theory which to his own

contemporaries seemed so natural and congenial he speaks or rather preaches

from the point of view not of the ecclesiastic but of the layman although

as a good catholic he is willing to acknowledge that in certain respects the

empire must submit to the church the beginning and end of all his noble

reflections and of his arguments good and bad is the aspiration that

in this little plot of earth belonging to mortal man life may pass in freedom

and peace so inextricably is his vision of the future bound up with the

beliefs and circumstances of his own age




the utopia of sir thomas more is a surprising monument of his

genius and shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries the book

was written by him at the age of about  or  and is full of the generous

sentiments of youth he brings the light of plato to bear upon the miserable

state of his own country living not long after the wars of the roses and in

the dregs of the catholic church in england he is indignant at the corruption

of the clergy at the luxury of the nobility and gentry at the sufferings of

the poor at the calamities caused by war to the eye of more the whole world

was in dissolution and decay and side by side with the misery and oppression

which he has described in the first book of the utopia he places in the second

book the ideal state which by the help of plato he had constructed the times

were full of stir and intellectual interest the distant murmur of the

reformation was beginning to be heard to minds like mores greek

literature was a revelation there had arisen an art of interpretation and the

new testament was beginning to be understood as it had never been before and

has not often been since in its natural sense the life there depicted

appeared to him wholly unlike that of christian commonwealths in which

he saw nothing but a certain conspiracy of rich men procuring their own

commodities under the name and title of the commonwealth he thought

that christ like plato instituted all things common for which

reason he tells us the citizens of utopia were the more willing to receive

his doctrines howbeit i think this was no small help and furtherance

in the matter that they heard us say that christ instituted among his all

things common and that the same community doth yet remain in the rightest

christian communities utopia the community of property is a fixed

idea with him though he is aware of the arguments which may be urged on the

other side these things i say when i consider with myself i hold

well with plato and do nothing marvel that he would make no laws for them that

refused those laws whereby all men should have and enjoy equal portions of

riches and commodities for the wise men did easily foresee this to be the one

and only way to the wealth of a community if equality of all things should be

brought in and established utopia we wonder how in the reign of

henry viii though veiled in another language and published in a foreign

country such speculations could have been endured




he is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who succeeded

him with the exception of swift in the art of feigning he is a worthy

disciple of plato like him starting from a small portion of fact he founds

his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the latin narrative of the

voyages of amerigo vespucci he is very precise about dates and facts and has

the power of making us believe that the narrator of the tale must have been an

eyewitness we are fairly puzzled by his manner of mixing up real and imaginary

persons his boy john clement and peter giles citizen of antwerp with whom he

disputes about the precise words which are supposed to have been used by the

imaginary portuguese traveller raphael hythloday i have the more

cause says hythloday to fear that my words shall not be

believed for that i know how difficultly and hardly i myself would have

believed another man telling the same if i had not myself seen it with mine

own eyes or again if you had been with me in utopia and had

presently seen their fashions and laws as i did which lived there five years

and more and would never have come thence but only to make the new land known

here etc more greatly regrets that he forgot to ask hythloday in what

part of the world utopia is situated he would have spent no small sum

of money rather than it should have escaped him and he begs peter giles

to see hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to the question after

this we are not surprised to hear that a professor of divinity perhaps

a late famous vicar of croydon in surrey as the translator

thinks is desirous of being sent thither as a missionary by the high bishop

yea and that he may himself be made bishop of utopia nothing doubting

that he must obtain this bishopric with suit and he counteth that a godly suit

which proceedeth not of the desire of honour or lucre but only of a godly

zeal the design may have failed through the disappearance of hythloday

concerning whom we have very uncertain news after his departure

there is no doubt however that he had told more and giles the exact situation

of the island but unfortunately at the same moment mores attention as

he is reminded in a letter from giles was drawn off by a servant and one of

the company from a cold caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent giles

from hearing and the secret has perished with him to this day

the place of utopia remains unknown




the words of phaedrus o socrates you can easily invent egyptians or

anything are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction yet

the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art but the originality of

thought more is as free as plato from the prejudices of his age and far more

tolerant the utopians do not allow him who believes not in the immortality of

the soul to share in the administration of the state laws howbeit

they put him to no punishment because they be persuaded that it is in no

mans power to believe what he list and no man is to be

blamed for reasoning in support of his own religion one of our company

in my presence was sharply punished he as soon as he was baptised began

against our wills with more earnest affection than wisdom to reason of

christs religion and began to wax so hot in his matter that he did not

only prefer our religion before all other but also did despise and condemn all

other calling them profane and the followers of them wicked and devilish and

the children of everlasting damnation when he had thus long reasoned the

matter they laid hold on him accused him and condemned him into exile not

as a despiser of religion but as a seditious person and a raiser up of

dissension among the people in the public services no

prayers be used but such as every man may boldly pronounce without giving

offence to any sect he says significantly there be that give

worship to a man that was once of excellent virtue or of famous glory not only

as god but also the chiefest and highest god but the most and the wisest

part rejecting all these believe that there is a certain godly power unknown

far above the capacity and reach of mans wit dispersed throughout all

the world not in bigness but in virtue and power him they call the father of

all to him alone they attribute the beginnings the increasings the

proceedings the changes and the ends of all things neither give they any

divine honours to any other than him so far was more from sharing the

popular beliefs of his time yet at the end he reminds us that he does not in

all respects agree with the customs and opinions of the utopians which he

describes and we should let him have the benefit of this saving clause and

not rudely withdraw the veil behind which he has been pleased to conceal

himself




nor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral

speculations he would like to bring military glory into contempt he would set

all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation including in the same class

priests women noblemen gentlemen and sturdy and valiant

beggars that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a day his

dislike of capital punishment and plans for the reformation of offenders his

detestation of priests and lawyers compare his satirical observation

they the utopians have priests of exceeding holiness and therefore

very few his remark that although every one may hear of ravenous dogs

and wolves and cruel maneaters it is not easy to find states that are well

and wisely governed are curiously at variance with the notions of his

age and indeed with his own life there are many points in which he shows a

modern feeling and a prophetic insight like plato he is a sanitary reformer

he maintains that civilized states have a right to the soil of waste countries

he is inclined to the opinion which places happiness in virtuous pleasures but

herein as he thinks not disagreeing from those other philosophers who define

virtue to be a life according to nature he extends the idea of happiness so as

to include the happiness of others and he argues ingeniously all men

agree that we ought to make others happy but if others how much more

ourselves and still he thinks that there may be a more excellent way

but to this no mans reason can attain unless heaven should inspire him

with a higher truth his ceremonies before marriage his humane proposal that

war should be carried on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy may be

compared to some of the paradoxes of plato he has a charming fancy like the

affinities of greeks and barbarians in the timaeus that the utopians learnt

the language of the greeks with the more readiness because they were originally

of the same race with them he is penetrated with the spirit of plato and

quotes or adapts many thoughts both from the republic and from the timaeus he

prefers public duties to private and is somewhat impatient of the importunity

of relations his citizens have no silver or gold of their own but are ready

enough to pay them to their mercenaries there is nothing of which he is more

contemptuous than the love of money gold is used for fetters of criminals and

diamonds and pearls for childrens necklaces when the ambassadors came

arrayed in gold and peacocks feathers to the eyes of all the

utopians except very few which had been in other countries for some reasonable

cause all that gorgeousness of apparel seemed shameful and reproachful in so

much that they most reverently saluted the vilest and most abject of them for

lordspassing over the ambassadors themselves without any honour judging

them by their wearing of golden chains to be bondmen you should have seen

children also that had cast away their pearls and precious stones when they

saw the like sticking upon the ambassadors caps dig and push their

mothers under the sides saying thus to themlook though he were

a little child still but the mother yea and that also in good earnest

peace son saith she i think he be some of the

ambassadors fools




like plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and princes on

the state of the world and of knowledge the hero of his discourse hythloday

is very unwilling to become a minister of state considering that he would lose

his independence and his advice would never be heeded compare an exquisite

passage of which the conclusion is as follows and verily it is

naturally givensuppressed and ended he ridicules the new logic of

his time the utopians could never be made to understand the doctrine of second

intentions for they have not devised one of all those rules of

restrictions amplifications and suppositions very wittily invented in the

small logicals which here our children in every place do learn furthermore

they were never yet able to find out the second intentions insomuch that none

of them all could ever see man himself in common as they call him though he

be as you know bigger than was ever any giant yea and pointed to of us even

with our finger he is very severe on the sports of the gentry the

utopians count hunting the lowest the vilest and the most abject part

of butchery he quotes the words of the republic in which the

philosopher is described standing out of the way under a wall until the

driving storm of sleet and rain be overpast which admit of a singular

application to mores own fate although writing twenty years before

about the year  he can hardly be supposed to have foreseen this there

is no touch of satire which strikes deeper than his quiet remark that the

greater part of the precepts of christ are more at variance with the lives of

ordinary christians than the discourse of utopia and yet the most part

of them is more dissident from the manners of the world now a days than my

communication was but preachers sly and wily men following your counsel as

i suppose because they saw men evilwilling to frame their manners to

christs rule they have wrested and wried his doctrine and like a rule

of lead have applied it to mens manners that by some means at the

least way they might agree together




the new atlantis is only a fragment and far inferior in merit to

the utopia the work is full of ingenuity but wanting in

creative fancy and by no means impresses the reader with a sense of

credibility in some places lord bacon is characteristically different from sir

thomas more as for example in the external state which he attributes to the

governor of solomons house whose dress he minutely describes while to

sir thomas more such trappings appear simple ridiculous yet after this

programme of dress bacon adds the beautiful trait that he had a look

as though he pitied men several things are borrowed by him from the

timaeus but he has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts and passages

which are taken from the hebrew scriptures




the city of the sun written by campanella  a

dominican friar several years after the new atlantis of bacon

has many resemblances to the republic of plato the citizens have wives and

children in common their marriages are of the same temporary sort and are

arranged by the magistrates from time to time they do not however adopt his

system of lots but bring together the best natures male and female

according to philosophical rules the infants until two years of

age are brought up by their mothers in public temples and since individuals

for the most part educate their children badly at the beginning of their third

year they are committed to the care of the state and are taught at first not

out of books but from paintings of all kinds which are emblazoned on the

walls of the city the city has six interior circuits of walls and an outer

wall which is the seventh on this outer wall are painted the figures of

legislators and philosophers and on each of the interior walls the symbols or

forms of some one of the sciences are delineated the women are for the most

part trained like the men in warlike and other exercises but they have two

special occupations of their own after a battle they and the boys soothe and

relieve the wounded warriors also they encourage them with embraces and

pleasant words some elements of the christian or catholic religion are

preserved among them the life of the apostles is greatly admired by this

people because they had all things in common and the short prayer which jesus

christ taught men is used in their worship it is a duty of the chief

magistrates to pardon sins and therefore the whole people make secret

confession of them to the magistrates and they to their chief who is a sort

of rector metaphysicus and by this means he is well informed of all that is

going on in the minds of men after confession absolution is granted to the

citizens collectively but no one is mentioned by name there also exists among

them a practice of perpetual prayer performed by a succession of priests who

change every hour their religion is a worship of god in trinity that is of

wisdom love and power but without any distinction of persons they behold in

the sun the reflection of his glory mere graven images they reject refusing

to fall under the tyranny of idolatry




many details are given about their customs of eating and drinking about their

mode of dressing their employments their wars campanella looks forward to a

new mode of education which is to be a study of nature and not of aristotle

he would not have his citizens waste their time in the consideration of what he

calls the dead signs of things he remarks that he who knows one

science only does not really know that one any more than the rest and insists

strongly on the necessity of a variety of knowledge more scholars are turned

out in the city of the sun in one year than by contemporary methods in ten or

fifteen he evidently believes like bacon that henceforward natural science

will play a great part in education a hope which seems hardly to have been

realized either in our own or in any former age at any rate the fulfilment of

it has been long deferred




there is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this work and a most

enlightened spirit pervades it but it has little or no charm of style and

falls very far short of the new atlantis of bacon and still more

of the utopia of sir thomas more it is full of inconsistencies

and though borrowed from plato shows but a superficial acquaintance with his

writings it is a work such as one might expect to have been written by a

philosopher and man of genius who was also a friar and who had spent

twentyseven years of his life in a prison of the inquisition the most

interesting feature of the book common to plato and sir thomas more is the

deep feeling which is shown by the writer of the misery and ignorance

prevailing among the lower classes in his own time campanella takes note of

aristotles answer to platos community of property that in a

society where all things are common no individual would have any motive to

work arist pol he replies that his citizens being happy and contented in

themselves they are required to work only four hours a day will have greater

regard for their fellows than exists among men at present he thinks like

plato that if he abolishes private feelings and interests a great public

feeling will take their place




other writings on ideal states such as the oceana of harrington

in which the lord archon meaning cromwell is described not as he was but as

he ought to have been or the argenis of barclay which is an

historical allegory of his own time are too unlike plato to be worth

mentioning more interesting than either of these and far more platonic in

style and thought is sir john eliots monarchy of man in

which the prisoner of the tower no longer able to be a politician in

the land of his birth turns away from politics to view that

other city which is within him and finds on the very threshold of the

grave that the secret of human happiness is the mastery of self the change of

government in the time of the english commonwealth set men thinking about first

principles and gave rise to many works of this classthe great original

genius of swift owes nothing to plato nor is there any trace in the

conversation or in the works of dr johnson of any acquaintance with his

writings he probably would have refuted plato without reading him in the same

fashion in which he supposed himself to have refuted bishop berkeleys

theory of the nonexistence of matter if we except the socalled english

platonists or rather neoplatonists who never understood their master and

the writings of coleridge who was to some extent a kindred spirit plato has

left no permanent impression on english literature




 human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that they are

affected by the examples of eminent men neither the one nor the other are

immediately applicable to practice but there is a virtue flowing from them

which tends to raise individuals above the common routine of society or trade

and to elevate states above the mere interests of commerce or the necessities

of selfdefence like the ideals of art they are partly framed by the omission

of particulars they require to be viewed at a certain distance and are apt to

fade away if we attempt to approach them they gain an imaginary distinctness

when embodied in a state or in a system of philosophy but they still remain

the visions of a world unrealized more striking and obvious to

the ordinary mind are the examples of great men who have served their own

generation and are remembered in another even in our own family circle there

may have been some one a woman or even a child in whose face has shone forth

a goodness more than human the ideal then approaches nearer to us and we

fondly cling to it the ideal of the past whether of our own past lives or of

former states of society has a singular fascination for the minds of many too

late we learn that such ideals cannot be recalled though the recollection of

them may have a humanizing influence on other times but the abstractions of

philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant they give light without warmth

they are like the full moon in the heavens when there are no stars appearing

men cannot live by thought alone the world of sense is always breaking in upon

them they are for the most part confined to a corner of earth and see but a

little way beyond their own home or place of abode they do not lift up

their eyes to the hills they are not awake when the dawn appears but

in plato we have reached a height from which a man may look into the distance

and behold the future of the world and of philosophy the ideal of the state

and of the life of the philosopher the ideal of an education continuing

through life and extending equally to both sexes the ideal of the unity and

correlation of knowledge the faith in good and immortalityare the

vacant forms of light on which plato is seeking to fix the eye of mankind




 two other ideals which never appeared above the horizon in greek

philosophy float before the minds of men in our own day one seen more clearly

than formerly as though each year and each generation brought us nearer to

some great change the other almost in the same degree retiring from view

behind the laws of nature as if oppressed by them but still remaining a

silent hope of we know not what hidden in the heart of man the first ideal is

the future of the human race in this world the second the future of the

individual in another the first is the more perfect realization of our own

present life the second the abnegation of it the one limited by experience

the other transcending it both of them have been and are powerful motives of

action there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all earthly

interests the hope of a future for the human race at first sight seems to be

the more disinterested the hope of individual existence the more egotistical

of the two motives but when men have learned to resolve their hope of a future

either for themselves or for the world into the will of godnot my

will but thine the difference between them falls away and they may be

allowed to make either of them the basis of their lives according to their own

individual character or temperament there is as much faith in the willingness

to work for an unseen future in this world as in another neither is it

inconceivable that some rare nature may feel his duty to another generation or

to another century almost as strongly as to his own or that living always in

the presence of god he may realize another world as vividly as he does this




the greatest of all ideals may or rather must be conceived by us under

similitudes derived from human qualities although sometimes like the jewish

prophets we may dash away these figures of speech and describe the nature of

god only in negatives these again by degrees acquire a positive meaning it

would be well if when meditating on the higher truths either of philosophy or

religion we sometimes substituted one form of expression for another lest

through the necessities of language we should become the slaves of mere words




there is a third ideal not the same but akin to these which has a place in

the home and heart of every believer in the religion of christ and in which

men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth the divine man the son of

man the saviour of mankind who is the firstborn and head of the whole family

in heaven and earth in whom the divine and human that which is without and

that which is within the range of our earthly faculties are indissolubly

united neither is this divine form of goodness wholly separable from the ideal

of the christian church which is said in the new testament to be his

body or at variance with those other images of good which plato sets

before us we see him in a figure only and of figures of speech we select but

a few and those the simplest to be the expression of him we behold him in a

picture but he is not there we gather up the fragments of his discourses but

neither do they represent him as he truly was his dwelling is neither in

heaven nor earth but in the heart of man this is that image which plato saw

dimly in the distance which when existing among men he called in the

language of homer the likeness of god the likeness of a nature

which in all ages men have felt to be greater and better than themselves and

which in endless forms whether derived from scripture or nature from the

witness of history or from the human heart regarded as a person or not as a

person with or without parts or passions existing in space or not in space

is and will always continue to be to mankind the idea of good




 the republic


 persons of the dialogue




socrates who is the narrator




glaucon




adeimantus




polemarchus




cephalus




thrasymachus




cleitophon




and others who are mute auditors




the scene is laid in the house of cephalus at the piraeus and the whole

dialogue is narrated by socrates the day after it actually took place to

timaeus hermocrates critias and a nameless person who are introduced in the

timaeus




 book i


i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston that i

might offer up my prayers to the goddess bendis the thracian artemis and

also because i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival

which was a new thing i was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants

but that of the thracians was equally if not more beautiful when we had

finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle we turned in the direction of

the city and at that instant polemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch

sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home and told his

servant to run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by the

cloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait




i turned round and asked him where his master was




there he is said the youth coming after you if you will only wait




certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchus appeared and

with him adeimantus glaucons brother niceratus the son of nicias and

several others who had been at the procession




polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and your companion are

already on your way to the city




you are not far wrong i said




but do you see he rejoined how many we are




of course




and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have to remain where

you are




may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade you to let us

go




but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said




certainly not replied glaucon




then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured




adeimantus added has no one told you of the torchrace on horseback in honour

of the goddess which will take place in the evening




with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carry torches and pass

them one to another during the race




yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will be celebrated at

night which you certainly ought to see let us rise soon after supper and see

this festival there will be a gathering of young men and we will have a good

talk stay then and do not be perverse




glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must




very good i replied




accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there we found his

brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachus the chalcedonian

charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son of aristonymus there too was

cephalus the father of polemarchus whom i had not seen for a long time and i

thought him very much aged he was seated on a cushioned chair and had a

garland on his head for he had been sacrificing in the court and there were

some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down

by him he saluted me eagerly and then he said




you dont come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i were

still able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but at my age i

can hardly get to the city and therefore you should come oftener to the

piraeus for let me tell you that the more the pleasures of the body fade

away the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation do not then

deny my request but make our house your resort and keep company with these

young men we are old friends and you will be quite at home with us




i replied there is nothing which for my part i like better cephalus than

conversing with aged men for i regard them as travellers who have gone a

journey which i too may have to go and of whom i ought to enquire whether the

way is smooth and easy or rugged and difficult and this is a question which i

should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call

the threshold of old ageis life harder towards the end or

what report do you give of it




i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men of my age flock

together we are birds of a feather as the old proverb says and at our

meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly isi cannot eat i cannot

drink the pleasures of youth and love are fled away there was a good time

once but now that is gone and life is no longer life some complain of the

slights which are put upon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of

how many evils their old age is the cause but to me socrates these

complainers seem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age

were the cause i too being old and every other old man would have felt as

they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whom i have

known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when in answer to the

question how does love suit with age sophoclesare you still the man

you were peace he replied most gladly have i escaped the thing of which you

speak i feel as if i had escaped from a mad and furious master his words have

often occurred to my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the time

when he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense of calm and

freedom when the passions relax their hold then as sophocles says we are

freed from the grasp not of one mad master only but of many the truth is

socrates that these regrets and also the complaints about relations are to

be attributed to the same cause which is not old age but mens

characters and tempers for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly

feel the pressure of age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth

and age are equally a burden




i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he might go

onyes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people in general are

not convinced by you when you speak thus they think that old age sits lightly

upon you not because of your happy disposition but because you are rich and

wealth is well known to be a great comforter




you are right he replied they are not convinced and there is something in

what they say not however so much as they imagine i might answer them as

themistocles answered the seriphian who was abusing him and saying that he was

famous not for his own merits but because he was an athenian if you

had been a native of my country or i of yours neither of us would have been

famous and to those who are not rich and are impatient of old age the

same reply may be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a light

burden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself




may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most part inherited or

acquired by you




acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired in the art of

making money i have been midway between my father and grandfather for my

grandfather whose name i bear doubled and trebled the value of his patrimony

that which he inherited being much what i possess now but my father lysanias

reduced the property below what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i

leave to these my sons not less but a little more than i received




that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see that you are

indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather of those who have

inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them the makers of

fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own resembling the

affection of authors for their own poems or of parents for their children

besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common

to them and all men and hence they are very bad company for they can talk

about nothing but the praises of wealth




that is true he said




yes that is very true but may i ask another questionwhat do you

consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth




one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince others for let me

tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to be near death fears and

cares enter into his mind which he never had before the tales of a world below

and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a

laughing matter to him but now he is tormented with the thought that they may

be true either from the weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer

to that other place he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and

alarms crowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider what

wrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of his

transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep

for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to him who is conscious

of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly says is the kind nurse of his age




hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in

justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his

journeyhope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man




how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches i do not say to

every man but to a good man is that he has had no occasion to deceive or to

defraud others either intentionally or unintentionally and when he departs to

the world below he is not in any apprehension about offerings due to the gods

or debts which he owes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of

wealth greatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thing

against another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to a man of

sense this is in my opinion the greatest




well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what is itto

speak the truth and to pay your debtsno more than this and even to this

are there not exceptions suppose that a friend when in his right mind has

deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind

ought i to give them back to him no one would say that i ought or that i

should be right in doing so any more than they would say that i ought always

to speak the truth to one who is in his condition




you are quite right he replied




but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a correct

definition of justice




quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed said polemarchus

interposing




i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to look after the

sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchus and the company




is not polemarchus your heir i said




to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices




tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides say and

according to you truly say about justice




he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so he appears to me

to be right




i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man but his

meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clear to me for he

certainly does not mean as we were just now saying that i ought to return a

deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it when he is not in

his right senses and yet a deposit cannot be denied to be a debt




true




then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by no means to

make the return




certainly not




when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he did not mean

to include that case




certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a friend

and never evil




you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of the

receiver if the two parties are friends is not the repayment of a

debtthat is what you would imagine him to say




yes




and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them




to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and an enemy as i

take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to himthat is to

say evil




simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to have spoken darkly of

the nature of justice for he really meant to say that justice is the giving to

each man what is proper to him and this he termed a debt




that must have been his meaning he said




by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by

medicine and to whom what answer do you think that he would make to us




he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to human

bodies




and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what




seasoning to food




and what is that which justice gives and to whom




if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding

instances then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to

enemies




that is his meaning then




i think so




and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time

of sickness




the physician




or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea




the pilot




and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man most

able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend




in going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other




but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of a physician




no




and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot




no




then in time of peace justice will be of no use




i am very far from thinking so




you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war




yes




like husbandry for the acquisition of corn




yes




or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoesthat is what you mean




yes




and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace




in contracts socrates justice is of use




and by contracts you mean partnerships




exactly




but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner at a

game of draughts




the skilful player




and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better

partner than the builder




quite the reverse




then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the

harpplayer as in playing the harp the harpplayer is certainly a better

partner than the just man




in a money partnership




yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do not want a

just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a horse a man who is

knowing about horses would be better for that would he not




certainly




and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot would be better




true




then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to be

preferred




when you want a deposit to be kept safely




you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie




precisely




that is to say justice is useful when money is useless




that is the inference




and when you want to keep a pruninghook safe then justice is useful to the

individual and to the state but when you want to use it then the art of the

vinedresser




clearly




and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use them you would

say that justice is useful but when you want to use them then the art of the

soldier or of the musician




certainly




and so of all other thingsjustice is useful when they are useless and

useless when they are useful




that is the inference




then justice is not good for much but let us consider this further point is

not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of fighting

best able to ward off a blow




certainly




and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best

able to create one




true




and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march upon the

enemy




certainly




then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief




that i suppose is to be inferred




then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good at stealing it




that is implied in the argument




then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and this is a lesson

which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for he speaking of

autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who is a favourite of his

affirms that




he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury




and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft

to be practised however for the good of friends and for the harm of

enemiesthat was what you were saying




no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say but i still

stand by the latter words




well there is another question by friends and enemies do we mean those who

are so really or only in seeming




surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good and

to hate those whom he thinks evil




yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many who are not good

seem to be so and conversely




that is true




then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends true




and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the

good




clearly




but the good are just and would not do an injustice




true




then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no wrong




nay socrates the doctrine is immoral




then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust




i like that better




but see the consequencemany a man who is ignorant of human nature has

friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought to do harm to them and

he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit but if so we shall be saying

the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning of simonides




very true he said and i think that we had better correct an error into which

we seem to have fallen in the use of the words friend and

enemy




what was the error polemarchus i asked




we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good




and how is the error to be corrected




we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as seems good and

that he who seems only and is not good only seems to be and is not a friend

and of an enemy the same may be said




you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies




yes




and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is just to do good to

our friends and harm to our enemies we should further say it is just to do

good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are

evil




yes that appears to me to be the truth




but ought the just to injure any one at all




undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies




when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated




the latter




deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses not of dogs




yes of horses




and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and not of horses




of course




and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the proper

virtue of man




certainly




and that human virtue is justice




to be sure




then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust




that is the result




but can the musician by his art make men unmusical




certainly not




or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen




impossible




and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking generally can the

good by virtue make them bad




assuredly not




any more than heat can produce cold




it cannot




or drought moisture




clearly not




nor can the good harm any one




impossible




and the just is the good




certainly




then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man but of

the opposite who is the unjust




i think that what you say is quite true socrates




then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts and that

good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends and evil the debt which

he owes to his enemiesto say this is not wise for it is not true if

as has been clearly shown the injuring of another can be in no case just




i agree with you said polemarchus




then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes such

a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or any other wise man or seer




i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said




shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be




whose




i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban or some

other rich and mighty man who had a great opinion of his own power was the

first to say that justice is doing good to your friends and harm to your

enemies




most true he said




yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks down what other can

be offered




several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made an attempt

to get the argument into his own hands and had been put down by the rest of

the company who wanted to hear the end but when polemarchus and i had done

speaking and there was a pause he could no longer hold his peace and

gathering himself up he came at us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we

were quite panicstricken at the sight of him




he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates has taken possession

of you all and why sillybillies do you knock under to one another i say

that if you want really to know what justice is you should not only ask but

answer and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an

opponent but have your own answer for there is many a one who can ask and

cannot answer and now i will not have you say that justice is duty or

advantage or profit or gain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do

for me i must have clearness and accuracy




i was panicstricken at his words and could not look at him without trembling

indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him i should have been

struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i looked at him first and was

therefore able to reply to him




thrasymachus i said with a quiver dont be hard upon us polemarchus

and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument but i can

assure you that the error was not intentional if we were seeking for a piece

of gold you would not imagine that we were knocking under to one

another and so losing our chance of finding it and why when we are

seeking for justice a thing more precious than many pieces of gold do you say

that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at

the truth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to do so but

the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know all things should

pity us and not be angry with us




how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter

laughthats your ironical style did i not foreseehave i

not already told you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer and

try irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoid answering




you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know that if you ask a

person what numbers make up twelve taking care to prohibit him whom you ask

from answering twice six or three times four or six times two or four times

three for this sort of nonsense will not do for methen

obviously if that is your way of putting the question no one can answer you

but suppose that he were to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if

one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am

i falsely to say some other number which is not the right oneis that

your meaninghow would you answer him




just as if the two cases were at all alike he said




why should they not be i replied and even if they are not but only appear to

be so to the person who is asked ought he not to say what he thinks whether

you and i forbid him or not




i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers




i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if upon reflection i approve

of any of them




but what if i give you an answer about justice other and better he said than

any of these what do you deserve to have done to you




done to meas becomes the ignorant i must learn from the

wisethat is what i deserve to have done to me




what and no payment a pleasant notion




i will pay when i have the money i replied




but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need be under no

anxiety about money for we will all make a contribution for socrates




yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always doesrefuse to

answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else




why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows and says that he

knows just nothing and who even if he has some faint notions of his own is

told by a man of authority not to utter them the natural thing is that the

speaker should be some one like yourself who professes to know and can tell

what he knows will you then kindly answer for the edification of the company

and of myself




glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and thrasymachus as

any one might see was in reality eager to speak for he thought that he had an

excellent answer and would distinguish himself but at first he affected to

insist on my answering at length he consented to begin behold he said the

wisdom of socrates he refuses to teach himself and goes about learning of

others to whom he never even says thank you




that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i am ungrateful i

wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay in praise which is all i

have and how ready i am to praise any one who appears to me to speak well you

will very soon find out when you answer for i expect that you will answer

well




listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing else than the

interest of the stronger and now why do you not praise me but of course you

wont




let me first understand you i replied justice as you say is the interest of

the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning of this you cannot mean to

say that because polydamas the pancratiast is stronger than we are and finds

the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is

therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just

for us




thats abominable of you socrates you take the words in the sense which

is most damaging to the argument




not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them and i wish

that you would be a little clearer




well he said have you never heard that forms of government differ there are

tyrannies and there are democracies and there are aristocracies




yes i know




and the government is the ruling power in each state




certainly




and the different forms of government make laws democratical aristocratical

tyrannical with a view to their several interests and these laws which are

made by them for their own interests are the justice which they deliver to

their subjects and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker of the

law and unjust and that is what i mean when i say that in all states there is

the same principle of justice which is the interest of the government and as

the government must be supposed to have power the only reasonable conclusion

is that everywhere there is one principle of justice which is the interest of

the stronger




now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not i will try to

discover but let me remark that in defining justice you have yourself used

the word interest which you forbade me to use it is true

however that in your definition the words of the stronger are

added




a small addition you must allow he said




great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whether what you

are saying is the truth now we are both agreed that justice is interest of

some sort but you go on to say of the stronger about this

addition i am not so sure and must therefore consider further




proceed




i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just for subjects to obey

their rulers




i do




but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are they sometimes

liable to err




to be sure he replied they are liable to err




then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly and sometimes

not




true




when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to their interest when

they are mistaken contrary to their interest you admit that




yes




and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjectsand that

is what you call justice




doubtless




then justice according to your argument is not only obedience to the interest

of the stronger but the reverse




what is that you are saying he asked




i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let us consider have

we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in

what they command and also that to obey them is justice has not that been

admitted




yes




then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest of the

stronger when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done which are

to their own injury for if as you say justice is the obedience which the

subject renders to their commands in that case o wisest of men is there any

escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is for

the interest but what is for the injury of the stronger




nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus




yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be his witness




but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus for thrasymachus himself

acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for their own

interest and that for subjects to obey them is justice




yes polemarchusthrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was

commanded by their rulers is just




yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest of the stronger

and while admitting both these propositions he further acknowledged that the

stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects to do what is not for his

own interest whence follows that justice is the injury quite as much as the

interest of the stronger




but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what the

stronger thought to be his interestthis was what the weaker had to do

and this was affirmed by him to be justice




those were not his words rejoined polemarchus




never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accept his

statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean by justice what the

stronger thought to be his interest whether really so or not




certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken the

stronger at the time when he is mistaken




yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admitted that the

ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken




you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example that he who is

mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken or that he who

errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the time

when he is making the mistake in respect of the mistake true we say that the

physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a

way of speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other

person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies

they none of them err unless their skill fails them and then they cease to be

skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what

his name implies though he is commonly said to err and i adopted the common

mode of speaking but to be perfectly accurate since you are such a lover of

accuracy we should say that the ruler in so far as he is a ruler is

unerring and being unerring always commands that which is for his own

interest and the subject is required to execute his commands and therefore

as i said at first and now repeat justice is the interest of the stronger




indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like an informer




certainly he replied




and do you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of injuring you

in the argument




nay he replied suppose is not the wordi know it but you

will be found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail




i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid any misunderstanding

occurring between us in future let me ask in what sense do you speak of a

ruler or stronger whose interest as you were saying he being the superior it

is just that the inferior should executeis he a ruler in the popular or

in the strict sense of the term




in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and play the informer if

you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you never will be able never




and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try and cheat

thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion




why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed




enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i should ask you a

question is the physician taken in that strict sense of which you are

speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of money and remember that i am now

speaking of the true physician




a healer of the sick he replied




and the pilotthat is to say the true pilotis he a captain of

sailors or a mere sailor




a captain of sailors




the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into account

neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot by which he is

distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but is significant of his skill

and of his authority over the sailors




very true he said




now i said every art has an interest




certainly




for which the art has to consider and provide




yes that is the aim of art




and the interest of any art is the perfection of itthis and nothing

else




what do you mean




i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body suppose you

were to ask me whether the body is selfsufficing or has wants i should reply

certainly the body has wants for the body may be ill and require to be cured

and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine ministers and this is

the origin and intention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right




quite right he replied




but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any quality

in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear fail of

hearing and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests of

seeing and hearinghas art in itself i say any similar liability to

fault or defect and does every art require another supplementary art to

provide for its interests and that another and another without end or have

the arts to look only after their own interests or have they no need either of

themselves or of anotherhaving no faults or defects they have no need

to correct them either by the exercise of their own art or of any other they

have only to consider the interest of their subjectmatter for every art

remains pure and faultless while remaining truethat is to say while

perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precise sense and tell me

whether i am not right




yes clearly




then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but the interest of

the body




true he said




nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of

horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do any other arts care

for themselves for they have no needs they care only for that which is the

subject of their art




true he said




but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own

subjects




to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance




then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the

stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject and weaker




he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finally acquiesced




then i continued no physician in so far as he is a physician considers his

own good in what he prescribes but the good of his patient for the true

physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject and is not a mere

moneymaker that has been admitted




yes




and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is a ruler of sailors

and not a mere sailor




that has been admitted




and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of the

sailor who is under him and not for his own or the rulers interest




he gave a reluctant yes




then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in so far as he is

a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his own interest but always what is

for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art to that he looks and

that alone he considers in everything which he says and does




when we had got to this point in the argument and every one saw that the

definition of justice had been completely upset thrasymachus instead of

replying to me said tell me socrates have you got a nurse




why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather to be answering




because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she has not even

taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep




what makes you say that i replied




because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the sheep or

oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or his

master and you further imagine that the rulers of states if they are true

rulers never think of their subjects as sheep and that they are not studying

their own advantage day and night oh no and so entirely astray are you in

your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the

just are in reality anothers good that is to say the interest of the

ruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant and injustice the

opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just he is the

stronger and his subjects do what is for his interest and minister to his

happiness which is very far from being their own consider further most

foolish socrates that the just is always a loser in comparison with the

unjust first of all in private contracts wherever the unjust is the partner

of the just you will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjust

man has always more and the just less secondly in their dealings with the

state when there is an incometax the just man will pay more and the unjust

less on the same amount of income and when there is anything to be received

the one gains nothing and the other much observe also what happens when they

take an office there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps

suffering other losses and getting nothing out of the public because he is

just moreover he is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to

serve them in unlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust

man i am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which the

advantage of the unjust is most apparent and my meaning will be most clearly

seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the

happiest of men and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the

most miserablethat is to say tyranny which by fraud and force takes

away the property of others not little by little but wholesale comprehending

in one things sacred as well as profane private and public for which acts of

wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them singly he would be

punished and incur great disgracethey who do such wrong in particular

cases are called robbers of temples and manstealers and burglars and

swindlers and thieves but when a man besides taking away the money of the

citizens has made slaves of them then instead of these names of reproach he

is termed happy and blessed not only by the citizens but by all who hear of

his having achieved the consummation of injustice for mankind censure

injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they

shrink from committing it and thus as i have shown socrates injustice when

on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice

and as i said at first justice is the interest of the stronger whereas

injustice is a mans own profit and interest




thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a bathman deluged our

ears with his words had a mind to go away but the company would not let him

they insisted that he should remain and defend his position and i myself added

my own humble request that he would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him

excellent man how suggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away

before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is the

attempt to determine the way of mans life so small a matter in your

eyesto determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the

greatest advantage




and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of the enquiry




you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about us

thrasymachuswhether we live better or worse from not knowing what you

say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee friend do not keep

your knowledge to yourself we are a large party and any benefit which you

confer upon us will be amply rewarded for my own part i openly declare that i

am not convinced and that i do not believe injustice to be more gainful than

justice even if uncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that

there may be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or

force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice

and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself perhaps we

may be wrong if so you in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken

in preferring justice to injustice




and how am i to convince you he said if you are not already convinced by what

i have just said what more can i do for you would you have me put the proof

bodily into your souls




heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or if you

change change openly and let there be no deception for i must remark

thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously said that although you

began by defining the true physician in an exact sense you did not observe a

like exactness when speaking of the shepherd you thought that the shepherd as

a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere

diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as a

trader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely the art of the

shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects he has only to

provide the best for them since the perfection of the art is already ensured

whenever all the requirements of it are satisfied and that was what i was

saying just now about the ruler i conceived that the art of the ruler

considered as ruler whether in a state or in private life could only regard

the good of his flock or subjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in

states that is to say the true rulers like being in authority




think nay i am sure of it




then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly without

payment unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage not of

themselves but of others let me ask you a question are not the several arts

different by reason of their each having a separate function and my dear

illustrious friend do say what you think that we may make a little progress




yes that is the difference he replied




and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general

onemedicine for example gives us health navigation safety at sea

and so on




yes he said




and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay but we do not

confuse this with other arts any more than the art of the pilot is to be

confused with the art of medicine because the health of the pilot may be

improved by a sea voyage you would not be inclined to say would you that

navigation is the art of medicine at least if we are to adopt your exact use

of language




certainly not




or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that

the art of payment is medicine




i should not




nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes

fees when he is engaged in healing




certainly not




and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is specially confined

to the art




yes




then if there be any good which all artists have in common that is to be

attributed to something of which they all have the common use




true he replied




and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an

additional use of the art of pay which is not the art professed by him




he gave a reluctant assent to this




then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective arts

but the truth is that while the art of medicine gives health and the art of

the builder builds a house another art attends them which is the art of pay

the various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that over which

they preside but would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he

were paid as well




i suppose not




but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing




certainly he confers a benefit




then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neither arts nor

governments provide for their own interests but as we were before saying

they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are the weaker

and not the strongerto their good they attend and not to the good of the

superior and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just now

saying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take in hand the

reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration for in

the execution of his work and in giving his orders to another the true artist

does not regard his own interest but always that of his subjects and

therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule they must be paid in one

of three modes of payment money or honour or a penalty for refusing




what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes of payment are

intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do not understand or how a

penalty can be a payment




you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the

best men is the great inducement to rule of course you know that ambition and

avarice are held to be as indeed they are a disgrace




very true




and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction for them good

men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so to get the

name of hirelings nor by secretly helping themselves out of the public

revenues to get the name of thieves and not being ambitious they do not care

about honour wherefore necessity must be laid upon them and they must be

induced to serve from the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the

reason why the forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be compelled

has been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment is that he

who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself and

the fear of this as i conceive induces the good to take office not because

they would but because they cannot helpnot under the idea that they are

going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves but as a necessity and

because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better

than themselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that if a city

were composed entirely of good men then to avoid office would be as much an

object of contention as to obtain office is at present then we should have

plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own

interest but that of his subjects and every one who knew this would choose

rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring

one so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is the interest

of the stronger this latter question need not be further discussed at present

but when thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous

than that of the just his new statement appears to me to be of a far more

serious character which of us has spoken truly and which sort of life

glaucon do you prefer




i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous he

answered




did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus was

rehearsing




yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me




then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we can that he is

saying what is not true




most certainly he replied




if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the

advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there must be a

numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side and in

the end we shall want judges to decide but if we proceed in our enquiry as we

lately did by making admissions to one another we shall unite the offices of

judge and advocate in our own persons




very good he said




and which method do i understand you to prefer i said




that which you propose




well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginning and answer

me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect justice




yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons




and what is your view about them would you call one of them virtue and the

other vice




certainly




i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice




what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirm injustice to be

profitable and justice not




what else then would you say




the opposite he replied




and would you call justice vice




no i would rather say sublime simplicity




then would you call injustice malignity




no i would rather say discretion




and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good




yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly unjust

and who have the power of subduing states and nations but perhaps you imagine

me to be talking of cutpurses even this profession if undetected has

advantages though they are not to be compared with those of which i was just

now speaking




i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus i replied but

still i cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice with wisdom and

virtue and justice with the opposite




certainly i do so class them




now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground for if

the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been admitted by

you as by others to be vice and deformity an answer might have been given to

you on received principles but now i perceive that you will call injustice

honourable and strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities

which were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do not hesitate

to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue




you have guessed most infallibly he replied




then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument so

long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus are speaking your real

mind for i do believe that you are now in earnest and are not amusing yourself

at our expense




i may be in earnest or not but what is that to youto refute the

argument is your business




very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be so good as answer

yet one more question does the just man try to gain any advantage over the

just




far otherwise if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature which he

is




and would he try to go beyond just action




he would not




and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust would

that be considered by him as just or unjust




he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage but he would not

be able




whether he would or would not be able i said is not to the point my question

is only whether the just man while refusing to have more than another just

man would wish and claim to have more than the unjust




yes he would




and what of the unjustdoes he claim to have more than the just man and

to do more than is just




of course he said for he claims to have more than all men




and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man

or action in order that he may have more than all




true




we may put the matter thus i saidthe just does not desire more than his

like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desires more than both his

like and his unlike




nothing he said can be better than that statement




and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither




good again he said




and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them




of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those who are of a

certain nature he who is not not




each of them i said is such as his like is




certainly he replied




very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of the arts you

would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician




yes




and which is wise and which is foolish




clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician is foolish




and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he is foolish




yes




and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician




yes




and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when he adjusts the lyre

would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and

loosening the strings




i do not think that he would




but he would claim to exceed the nonmusician




of course




and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats and drinks would

he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine




he would not




but he would wish to go beyond the nonphysician




yes




and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether you think that any

man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying or doing

more than another man who has knowledge would he not rather say or do the same

as his like in the same case




that i suppose can hardly be denied




and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more than either the

knowing or the ignorant




i dare say




and the knowing is wise




yes




and the wise is good




true




then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like but more

than his unlike and opposite




i suppose so




whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both




yes




but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond both his like and

unlike were not these your words




they were




and you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his unlike




yes




then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like the evil and

ignorant




that is the inference




and each of them is such as his like is




that was admitted




then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and

ignorant




thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeat them but

with extreme reluctance it was a hot summers day and the perspiration

poured from him in torrents and then i saw what i had never seen before

thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreed that justice was virtue and

wisdom and injustice vice and ignorance i proceeded to another point




well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but were we not also

saying that injustice had strength do you remember




yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve of what you are

saying or have no answer if however i were to answer you would be quite

certain to accuse me of haranguing therefore either permit me to have my say

out or if you would rather ask do so and i will answer very

good as they say to storytelling old women and will nod

yes and no




certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion




yes he said i will to please you since you will not let me speak what else

would you have




nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i will ask and you

shall answer




proceed




then i will repeat the question which i asked before in order that our

examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be carried on

regularly a statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful

than justice but now justice having been identified with wisdom and virtue

is easily shown to be stronger than injustice if injustice is ignorance this

can no longer be questioned by any one but i want to view the matter

thrasymachus in a different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust

and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have already

enslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection




true he replied and i will add that the best and most perfectly unjust state

will be most likely to do so




i know i said that such was your position but what i would further consider

is whether this power which is possessed by the superior state can exist or be

exercised without justice or only with justice




if you are right in your view and justice is wisdom then only with justice

but if i am right then without justice




i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent and dissent

but making answers which are quite excellent




that is out of civility to you he replied




you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also to inform me

whether you think that a state or an army or a band of robbers and thieves

or any other gang of evildoers could act at all if they injured one another




no indeed he said they could not




but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might act together

better




yes




and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting and

justice imparts harmony and friendship is not that true thrasymachus




i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you




how good of you i said but i should like to know also whether injustice

having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever existing among slaves or among

freemen will not make them hate one another and set them at variance and

render them incapable of common action




certainly




and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarrel and fight

and become enemies to one another and to the just




they will




and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would your wisdom say that

she loses or that she retains her natural power




let us assume that she retains her power




yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever

she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in a family or in any

other body that body is to begin with rendered incapable of united action by

reason of sedition and distraction and does it not become its own enemy and at

variance with all that opposes it and with the just is not this the case




yes certainly




and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person in the

first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with

himself and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just

is not that true thrasymachus




yes




and o my friend i said surely the gods are just




granted that they are




but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the just will be their

friend




feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i will not oppose

you lest i should displease the company




well then proceed with your answers and let me have the remainder of my

repast for we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and better

and abler than the unjust and that the unjust are incapable of common action

nay more that to speak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time

vigorously together is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly evil

they would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident that there must

have been some remnant of justice in them which enabled them to combine if

there had not been they would have injured one another as well as their

victims they were but halfvillains in their enterprises for had they been

whole villains and utterly unjust they would have been utterly incapable of

action that as i believe is the truth of the matter and not what you said

at first but whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust

is a further question which we also proposed to consider i think that they

have and for the reasons which i have given but still i should like to

examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing less than the rule of

human life




proceed




i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that a horse has some

end




i should




and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be

accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing




i do not understand he said




let me explain can you see except with the eye




certainly not




or hear except with the ear




no




these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs




they may




but you can cut off a vinebranch with a dagger or with a chisel and in many

other ways




of course




and yet not so well as with a pruninghook made for the purpose




true




may we not say that this is the end of a pruninghook




we may




then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when i

asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be

accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing




i understand your meaning he said and assent




and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need i ask again

whether the eye has an end




it has




and has not the eye an excellence




yes




and the ear has an end and an excellence also




true




and the same is true of all other things they have each of them an end and a

special excellence




that is so




well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper

excellence and have a defect instead




how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see




you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which is sight but

i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather ask the question more

generally and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil

them by their own proper excellence and fail of fulfilling them by their own

defect




certainly he replied




i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their own proper excellence

they cannot fulfil their end




true




and the same observation will apply to all other things




i agree




well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil for example

to superintend and command and deliberate and the like are not these functions

proper to the soul and can they rightly be assigned to any other




to no other




and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul




assuredly he said




and has not the soul an excellence also




yes




and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that

excellence




she cannot




then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent and the

good soul a good ruler




yes necessarily




and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul and injustice

the defect of the soul




that has been admitted




then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjust man will

live ill




that is what your argument proves




and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill the reverse of

happy




certainly




then the just is happy and the unjust miserable




so be it




but happiness and not misery is profitable




of course




then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be more profitable than

justice




let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea




for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have grown gentle towards

me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have not been well entertained

but that was my own fault and not yours as an epicure snatches a taste of

every dish which is successively brought to table he not having allowed

himself time to enjoy the one before so have i gone from one subject to

another without having discovered what i sought at first the nature of

justice i left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is

virtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a further question

about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice i could not refrain

from passing on to that and the result of the whole discussion has been that i

know nothing at all for i know not what justice is and therefore i am not

likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just

man is happy or unhappy




 book ii


with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but

the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always

the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement

he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish

really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is

always better than to be unjust




i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could




then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you nowhow would you

arrange goodsare there not some which we welcome for their own sakes

and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures

and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from

them




i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied




is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health

which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results




certainly i said




and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of

the sick and the physicians art also the various ways of

moneymakingthese do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no

one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward

or result which flows from them




there is i said this third class also but why do you ask




because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice




in the highest class i repliedamong those goods which he who would be

happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results




then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in

the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of

rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be

avoided




i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the

thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice

and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him




i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see

whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have

been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind

the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside

their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how

they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the

argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of

justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all

men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a

good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life

of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the justif what

they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i

acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and

myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet

heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a

satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i

shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most

likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost

of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i

desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say

whether you approve of my proposal




indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would

oftener wish to converse




i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as

i proposed of the nature and origin of justice




they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil

but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and

suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the

one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among

themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and

that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they

affirm to be the origin and nature of justiceit is a mean or

compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be

punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power

of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is

tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the

inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man

would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be

mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin

of justice




now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have

not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this

kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will

let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in

the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road

following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only

diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are

supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as

is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian

according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of

lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth

at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended

into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse

having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature

as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring

this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met

together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about

the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his

finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the

ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the

company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was

astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards

and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same

resultwhen he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when

outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the

messengers who were sent to the court whereas soon as he arrived he seduced

the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took

the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put

on one of them and the unjust the other no man can be imagined to be of such

an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands

off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the

market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or

release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men

then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would

both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great

proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is

any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks

that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their

hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice

and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if

you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never

doing any wrong or touching what was anothers he would be thought by

the lookerson to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to

one anothers faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear

that they too might suffer injustice enough of this




now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we

must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be

effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man

entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to

be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the

unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or

physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits

and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the

unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to

be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest

reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that

in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is

to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to

have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false

step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with

effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where

force is required by his courage and strength and command of money and

friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and

simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must

be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and

then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the

sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and

have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite

of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst

then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be

affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus

to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have

reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice

let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two




heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the

decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues




i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no

difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i

will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too

coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not

minelet me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they

will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked

boundwill have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every

kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem

only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of

the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not

live with a view to appearanceshe wants to be really unjust and not to

seem only




his mind has a soil deep and fertile out of which spring his prudent

counsels




in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city

he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can

trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has

no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or

private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and

is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies

moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly

and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour

in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer

than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite

in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just




i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his

brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is

nothing more to be urged




why what else is there i answered




the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied




well then according to the proverb let brother help

brotherif he fails in any part do you assist him although i must

confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and

take from me the power of helping justice




nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to

glaucons argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice

which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his

meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that

they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of

character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just

some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated

among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice

more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the

others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a

shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and

this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of

whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just


 to bear acorns at their summit and bees in the

middle

and the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces




and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a

very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is




as the fame of some blameless king who like a god maintains justice

to whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley whose trees are bowed

with fruit and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him

fish




still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to

the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints

lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their

idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of

virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of

the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is

the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another

strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a

sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict

upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just

who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is

their manner of praising the one and censuring the other




once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about

justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in

prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice

and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of

vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and

opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than

dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour

them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way

influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor

even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most

extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they

say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and

happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich mens doors

and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of

making an atonement for a mans own or his ancestors sins by

sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an

enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and

incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets

are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with

the words of hesiod




vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her

dwellingplace is near but before virtue the gods have set toil




and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may

be influenced by men for he also says




the gods too may be turned from their purpose and men pray to them

and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations

and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed




and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were

children of the moon and the musesthat is what they sayaccording

to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but

whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices

and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the

living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us

from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us




he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice

and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be

affected my dear socratesthose of them i mean who are quickwitted

and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear

are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and

in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the

youth will say to himself in the words of pindar




can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower

which may be a fortress to me all my days




for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just

profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are

unmistakeable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a

heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance

tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote

myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the

vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty

fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one

exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i

answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we

would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to

concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and

there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and

assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make

unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods

cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no

gods or suppose them to have no care of human thingswhy in either case

should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care

about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the

poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and

turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings

let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak

truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice

for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall

lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains

and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be

propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in

which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes

my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities

and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the

children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony




on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the

worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to

appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and

after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing

all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or

rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from

laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one

who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that

justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to

forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free

will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may

have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the

truthbut no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice

or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved

by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as

far as he can be




the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the

argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of

all the professing panegyrists of justicebeginning with the ancient

heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men

of our own timeno one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice

except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them

no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true

essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any

human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a mans soul

which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the

greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade

us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep

one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman

because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of

evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the

language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these

about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true

nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you

because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show

not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they

have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an

evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations

for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the

false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it

we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that

you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is anothers

good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a mans own

profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted

that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for

their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakeslike sight

or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely

conventional goodi would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one

point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work

in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice

magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a

manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you

who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i

hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore

i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show

what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be

a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men




i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these

words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was

not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in

honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of

megara




sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an

illustrious hero




the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being

able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining

unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not

convincedthis i infer from your general character for had i judged only

from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my

confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i

am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the

task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not

satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought

the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to

help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an

impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a

hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can




glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop

but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first

about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative

advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a

serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we

are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may

illustrate thus suppose that a shortsighted person had been asked by some one

to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that

they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters

were largerif they were the same and he could read the larger letters

first and then proceed to the lesserthis would have been thought a rare

piece of good fortune




very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry




i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is

as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes

as the virtue of a state




true he replied




and is not a state larger than an individual




it is




then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more

easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of

justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the

individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them




that he said is an excellent proposal




and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice

and injustice of the state in process of creation also




i dare say




when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search

will be more easily discovered




yes far more easily




but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am

inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore




i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed




a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is

selfsufficing but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state

be imagined




there can be no other




then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one

takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners

and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is

termed a state




true he said




and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under

the idea that the exchange will be for their good




very true




then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator

is necessity who is the mother of our invention




of course he replied




now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of

life and existence




certainly




the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like




true




and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we

may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a

weavershall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor

to our bodily wants




quite right




the barest notion of a state must include four or five men




clearly




and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a

common stockthe individual husbandman for example producing for four

and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of

food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing

to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide

for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the

remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or

a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all

his own wants




adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at

producing everything




probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say

this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of

natures among us which are adapted to different occupations




very true




and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or

when he has only one




when he has only one




further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right

time




no doubt




for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at

leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business

his first object




he must




and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and

easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to

him and does it at the right time and leaves other things




undoubtedly




then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make

his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to

be good for anything neither will the builder make his toolsand he too

needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker




true




then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our

little state which is already beginning to grow




true




yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our

husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may

have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hidesstill

our state will not be very large




that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all

these




then again there is the situation of the cityto find a place where

nothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible




impossible




then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply

from another city




there must




but if the trader goes emptyhanded having nothing which they require who

would supply his need he will come back emptyhanded




that is certain




and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves

but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their

wants are supplied




very true




then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required




they will




not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants




yes




then we shall want merchants




we shall




and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be

needed and in considerable numbers




yes in considerable numbers




then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to

secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects

when we formed them into a society and constituted a state




clearly they will buy and sell




then they will need a marketplace and a moneytoken for purposes of exchange




certainly




suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market

and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with himis he

to leave his calling and sit idle in the marketplace




not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the

office of salesmen in wellordered states they are commonly those who are the

weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose

their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to

those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy




this want then creates a class of retailtraders in our state is not

retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the

marketplace engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one

city to another are called merchants




yes he said




and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the

level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour

which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings

hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour




true




then hirelings will help to make up our population




yes




and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected




i think so




where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state

did they spring up




probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another i cannot imagine

that they are more likely to be found any where else




i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think

the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry




let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we

have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes

and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will

work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially

clothed and shod they will feed on barleymeal and flour of wheat baking and

kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat

of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn

with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the

wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the

praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take

care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or

war




but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal




true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a relishsalt

and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country

people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and

they will roast myrtleberries and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation

and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good

old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them




yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else

would you feed the beasts




but what would you have glaucon i replied




why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people

who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables

and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style




yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider

is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly

there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see

how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy

constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish

also to see a state at feverheat i have no objection for i suspect that many

will not be satisfied with the simpler way of life they will be for adding

sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and

incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in

every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first

speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and

the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts

of materials must be procured




true he said




then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer

sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of

callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of

hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours

another will be the votaries of musicpoets and their attendant train of

rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of

articles including womens dresses and we shall want more servants

will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and

barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not

needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are

needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other

kinds if people eat them




certainly




and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than

before




much greater




and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be

too small now and not enough




quite true




then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and

tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed

the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of

wealth




that socrates will be inevitable




and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not




most certainly he replied




then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may

affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are

also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public




undoubtedly




and our state must once more enlarge and this time the enlargement will be

nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the

invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we

were describing above




why he said are they not capable of defending themselves




no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all

of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was

that one man cannot practise many arts with success




very true he said




but is not war an art




certainly




and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking




quite true




and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman or a weaver or a

builderin order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and

to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted

and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he

was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now

nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well

done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is

also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world

would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a

recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and

nothing else no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence

nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never

bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or

other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with

heavyarmed or any other kind of troops




yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond

price




and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill

and art and application will be needed by him




no doubt he replied




will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling




certainly




then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the

task of guarding the city




it will




and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do

our best




we must




is not the noble youth very like a wellbred dog in respect of guarding and

watching




what do you mean




i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the

enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they

have to fight with him




all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them




well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well




certainly




and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any

other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is

spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be

absolutely fearless and indomitable




i have




then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in

the guardian




true




and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit




yes




but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with

everybody else




a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied




whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to

their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their

enemies to destroy them




true he said




what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has

also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other




true




he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities

and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must

infer that to be a good guardian is impossible




i am afraid that what you say is true he replied




here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had precededmy

friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight

of the image which we had before us




what do you mean he said




i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities




and where do you find them




many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very

good one you know that wellbred dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars

and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers




yes i know




then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a

guardian who has a similar combination of qualities




certainly not




would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need

to have the qualities of a philosopher




i do not apprehend your meaning




the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and

is remarkable in the animal




what trait




why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he

welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any

good did this never strike you as curious




the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your

remark




and surely this instinct of the dog is very charmingyour dog is a true

philosopher




why




why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the

criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of

learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and

ignorance




most assuredly




and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy




they are the same he replied




and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle

to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and

knowledge




that we may safely affirm




then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require

to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength




undoubtedly




then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how

are they to be reared and educated is not this an enquiry which may be

expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final endhow

do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit

what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length




adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us




then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat

long




certainly not




come then and let us pass a leisure hour in storytelling and our story shall

be the education of our heroes




by all means




and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional

sortand this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for

the soul




true




shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards




by all means




and when you speak of music do you include literature or not




i do




and literature may be either true or false




yes




and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false




i do not understand your meaning he said




you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not

wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are

told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics




very true




that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics




quite right he said




you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work

especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at

which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily

taken




quite true




and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may

be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the

most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when

they are grown up




we cannot




then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of

fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and

reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children

the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more

fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are

now in use must be discarded




of what tales are you speaking he said




you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are

necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them




very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the

greater




those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the

poets who have ever been the great storytellers of mankind




but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them




a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is

more a bad lie




but when is this fault committed




whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and

heroesas when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a

likeness to the original




yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blameable but what are the

stories which you mean




first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which

the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie tooi mean what

hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of

cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if

they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless

persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an

absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a

mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge

and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few

indeed




why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable




yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young

man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from

doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when he

does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the

first and greatest among the gods




i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit

to be repeated




neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling

among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them

of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one

another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the

giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about

the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and

relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is

unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between

citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children

and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a

similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how

on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being

beaten and all the battles of the gods in homerthese tales must not be

admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical

meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is

literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to

become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the

tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts




there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to

be found and of what tales are you speakinghow shall we answer him




i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but

founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general

forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be

observed by them but to make the tales is not their business




very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean




something of this kind i repliedgod is always to be represented as he

truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the

representation is given




right




and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such




certainly




and no good thing is hurtful




no indeed




and that which is not hurtful hurts not




certainly not




and that which hurts not does no evil




no




and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil




impossible




and the good is advantageous




yes




and therefore the cause of wellbeing




yes




it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the

good only




assuredly




then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert

but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to

men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good

is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought

elsewhere and not in him




that appears to me to be most true he said




then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the

folly of saying that two casks




lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of

evil lots




and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two




sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good




but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill




him wild hunger drives oer the beauteous earth




and again




zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us




and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was

really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the

strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall

not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of

aeschylus that




god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a

house




and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobethe subject of the

tragedy in which these iambic verses occuror of the house of pelops or

of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say

that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some

explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was

just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who

are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their

miserythe poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the

wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by

receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to

any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in

verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any wellordered

commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious




i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law




let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which

our poets and reciters will be expected to conformthat god is not the

author of all things but of good only




that will do he said




and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a

magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in

anothersometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes

deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the

same immutably fixed in his own proper image




i cannot answer you he said without more thought




well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be

effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing




most certainly




and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or

discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is

least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the

fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any

similar causes




of course




and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any

external influence




true




and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite

thingsfurniture houses garments when good and well made they are

least altered by time and circumstances




very true




then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least

liable to suffer change from without




true




but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect




of course they are




then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes




he cannot




but may he not change and transform himself




clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all




and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and

more unsightly




if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him

to be deficient either in virtue or beauty




very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to

make himself worse




impossible




then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is

supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains

absolutely and for ever in his own form




that necessarily follows he said in my judgment




then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that




the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and

down cities in all sorts of forms




and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in

tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the

likeness of a priestess asking an alms




for the lifegiving daughters of inachus the river of argos




let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers

under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of

these mythstelling how certain gods as they say go about by

night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let

them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time

speak blasphemy against the gods




heaven forbid he said




but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and

deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms




perhaps he replied




well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or

deed or to put forth a phantom of himself




i cannot say he replied




do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be

allowed is hated of gods and men




what do you mean he said




i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and

highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above

all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him




still he said i do not comprehend you




the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words

but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the

highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in

that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least

likethat i say is what they utterly detest




there is nothing more hateful to them




and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is

deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of

imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure

unadulterated falsehood am i not right




perfectly right




the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men




yes




whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing

with enemiesthat would be an instance or again when those whom we call

our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it

is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of

mythology of which we were just now speakingbecause we do not know the

truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and

so turn it to account




very true he said




but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant

of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention




that would be ridiculous he said




then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god




i should say not




or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies




that is inconceivable




but he may have friends who are senseless or mad




but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god




then no motive can be imagined why god should lie




none whatever




then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood




yes




then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he

deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision




your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own




you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which

we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who

transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way




i grant that




then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which

zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in

which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials




was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long and

to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed

of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that

the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now

he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who

said thishe it is who has slain my son




these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger

and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow

teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we

do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the

gods and like them




i entirely agree he said in these principles and promise to make them my

laws




 book iii


such then i said are our principles of theologysome tales are to be

told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards

if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship

with one another




yes and i think that our principles are right he said




but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides

these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any

man be courageous who has the fear of death in him




certainly not he said




and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than

defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible




impossible




then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well

as over the others and beg them not simply to revile but rather to commend the

world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do

harm to our future warriors




that will be our duty he said




then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning

with the verses




i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than

rule over all the dead who have come to nought




we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared




lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen

both of mortals and immortals




and again




o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form

but no mind at all




again of tiresias




to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone

should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades




again




the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamenting her fate

leaving manhood and youth




again




and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the

earth




and




as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of them has dropped out

of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another

so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved




and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out

these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to

the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less

are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who

should fear slavery more than death




undoubtedly




also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which

describe the world belowcocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and

sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a

shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say

that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a

danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and

effeminate by them




there is a real danger he said




then we must have no more of them




true




another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us




clearly




and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men




they will go with the rest




but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that

the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his

comrade




yes that is our principle




and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had

suffered anything terrible




he will not




such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own

happiness and therefore is least in need of other men




true he said




and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of

fortune is to him of all men least terrible




assuredly




and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the

greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him




yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another




then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and

making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or

to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the

defenders of their country may scorn to do the like




that will be very right




then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict

achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his

back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the

shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and

pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which

homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as

praying and beseeching




rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name




still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods

lamenting and saying




alas my misery alas that i bore the bravest to my sorrow




but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely

to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say




o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased

round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful




or again




woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at

the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius




for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy

representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly

will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by

similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his

mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or selfcontrol

he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions




yes he said that is most true




yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has

just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a

better




it ought not to be




neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter

which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction




so i believe




then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as

overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be

allowed




still less of the gods as you say he replied




then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that

of homer when he describes how




inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw

hephaestus bustling about the mansion




on your views we must not admit them




on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is

certain




again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless

to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such

medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no

business with them




clearly not he said




then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the

state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or

with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody

else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this

privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more

heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the

truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for

a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest

of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors




most true he said




if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state




any of the craftsmen whether he be priest or physician or

carpenter




he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and

destructive of ship or state




most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out




in the next place our youth must be temperate




certainly




are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to

commanders and selfcontrol in sensual pleasures




true




then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer




friend sit still and obey my word




and the verses which follow




the greeks marched breathing prowess in silent awe of their

leaders




and other sentiments of the same kind




we shall




what of this line




o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a

stag




and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar

impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their

rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken




they are ill spoken




they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to

temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young menyou

would agree with me there




yes




and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is

more glorious than




when the tables are full of bread and meat and the cupbearer carries

round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups




is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the

verse




the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger




what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men

were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them

all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight

of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on

the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before

even when they first met one another




without the knowledge of their parents




or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a

chain around ares and aphrodite




indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort

of thing




but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they

ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses




he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart endure my heart

far worse hast thou endured




certainly he said




in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of

money




certainly not




neither must we sing to them of




gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings




neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have

given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of

the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his

anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been

such a lover of money that he took agamemnons gifts or that when he had

received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment

he was unwilling to do so




undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved




loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings

to achilles or in believing that they are truly attributed to him he is

guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his

insolence to apollo where he says




thou hast wronged me o fardarter most abominable of deities verily i

would be even with thee if i had only the power




or his insubordination to the rivergod on whose divinity he is ready to lay

hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been

previously dedicated to the other rivergod spercheius and that he actually

performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and

slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was

guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise

cheirons pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest

of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be

at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not

untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men




you are quite right he replied




and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of

theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did

to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do

such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day

and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not

done by them or that they were not the sons of godsboth in the same

breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to

persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are

no better than mensentiments which as we were saying are neither pious

nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods




assuredly not




and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for

everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar

wickednesses are always being perpetrated by




the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar

the altar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida




and who have




the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins




and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of

morals among the young




by all means he replied




but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be

spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which

gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been

already laid down




very true




and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our

subject




clearly so




but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend




why not




because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and

storytellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us

that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is

profitable when undetected but that justice is a mans own loss and

anothers gainthese things we shall forbid them to utter and

command them to sing and say the opposite




to be sure we shall he replied




but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have

implied the principle for which we have been all along contending




i grant the truth of your inference




that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we

cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally

advantageous to the possessor whether he seem to be just or not




most true he said




enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this

has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated




i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus




then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i

put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and

poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come




certainly he replied




and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the

two




that again he said i do not quite understand




i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in

making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the

whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning

you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses

prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a

passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger

of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines




and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the

chiefs of the people




the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is

any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he

does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the

aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative

of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey




yes




and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from

time to time and in the intermediate passages




quite true




but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he

assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to

speak




certainly




and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or

gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes




of course




then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of

imitation




very true




or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the

imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in

order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say

i dont understand i will show how the change might be

effected if homer had said the priest came having his

daughters ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all

the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he

had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but

simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and

therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on

behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but

begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he

brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the

priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come

again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to

himthe daughter of chryses should not be released he saidshe

should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to

provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in

fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his

many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him

whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his

good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his

tears by the arrows of the godand so on in this way the whole

becomes simple narrative




i understand he said




or you may suppose the opposite casethat the intermediate passages are

omitted and the dialogue only left




that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy




you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed

to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in

some cases wholly imitativeinstances of this are supplied by tragedy

and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the poet is the only

speakerof this the dithyramb affords the best example and the

combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do

i take you with me




yes he said i see now what you meant




i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with

the subject and might proceed to the style




yes i remember




in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about

the mimetic artwhether the poets in narrating their stories are to be

allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the

latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited




you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into

our state




yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know

as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go




and go we will he said




then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators

or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down

that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt

many he will altogether fail of gaining much reputation in any




certainly




and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as

well as he would imitate a single one




he cannot




then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at

the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even

when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot

succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedydid

you not just now call them imitations




yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed

in both




any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once




true




neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but

imitations




they are so




and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller

pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing

well the actions of which the imitations are copies




quite true he replied




if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians

setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the

maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in

no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate

anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward

only those characters which are suitable to their professionthe

courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or

be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from

imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how

imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length

grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind




yes certainly he said




then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we

say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old

quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in

conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping

and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour




very right he said




neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of

slaves




they must not




and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of

what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in

drink or out of drink or who in any other manner sin against themselves and

their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they

be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad

for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated




very true he replied




neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains

or the like




how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the

callings of any of these




nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur

of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing




nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of

madmen




you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of

narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything

to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character

and education




and which are these two sorts he asked




suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration

comes on some saying or action of another good mani should imagine that

he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of

imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is

acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or

love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a

character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will

disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment

only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed

to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and

frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art

unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it




so i should expect he replied




then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of

homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but

there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you

agree




certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily

take




but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the

worse he is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him

and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good

earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt

to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hail or the creaking

of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and

all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow

like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and

there will be very little narration




that he said will be his mode of speaking




these then are the two kinds of style




yes




and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but

slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their

simplicity the result is that the speaker if he speaks correctly is always

pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single

harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of

nearly the same rhythm




that is quite true he said




whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if

the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of

changes




that is also perfectly true he replied




and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry

and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or

other of them or in both together




they include all he said




and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the

two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed




i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue




yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed

the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most

popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in

general




i do not deny it




but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in

which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only




yes quite unsuitable




and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a

shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a

husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader

also and the same throughout




true he said




and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever

that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit

himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy

and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he

are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have

anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send

him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the

rougher and severer poet or storyteller who will imitate the style of the

virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when

we began the education of our soldiers




we certainly will he said if we have the power




then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which

relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter

and manner have both been discussed




i think so too he said




next in order will follow melody and song




that is obvious




every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be

consistent with ourselves




i fear said glaucon laughing that the word every one hardly

includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may

guess




at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three partsthe words

the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose




yes he said so much as that you may




and as for the words there will surely be no difference between words which

are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and

these have been already determined by us




yes




and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words




certainly




we were saying when we spoke of the subjectmatter that we had no need of

lamentation and strains of sorrow




true




and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell

me




the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the fulltoned

or bass lydian and such like




these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to

maintain they are of no use and much less to men




certainly




in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly

unbecoming the character of our guardians




utterly unbecoming




and which are the soft or drinking harmonies




the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed




well and are these of any military use




quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the

only ones which you have left




i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to

sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and

stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death

or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of

fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by

him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of

necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction

and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to

yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by

prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but

acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the

event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the

strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the

fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say

leave




and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was

just now speaking




then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies

we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale




i suppose not




then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and

complex scales or the makers of any other manystringed curiouslyharmonised

instruments




certainly not




but what do you say to flutemakers and fluteplayers would you admit them

into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute

is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic

music is only an imitation of the flute




clearly not




there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the

shepherds may have a pipe in the country




that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument




the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is

not at all strange i said




not at all he replied




and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state

which not long ago we termed luxurious




and we have done wisely he replied




then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies

rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules

for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind

but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and

harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the

melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to

say what these rhythms are will be your dutyyou must teach me them as

you have already taught me the harmonies




but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some

three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in

sounds there are four notes ie the four notes of the tetrachord out of

which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made

but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say




then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what

rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other

unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite

feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning

a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in

some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the

rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am

mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned

to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or

censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a

combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters

however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the

analysis of the subject would be difficult you know socrates expresses

himself carelessly in accordance with his assumed ignorance of the details of

the subject in the first part of the sentence he appears to be speaking of

paeonic rhythms which are in the ratio of  in the second part of dactylic

and anapaestic rhythms which are in the ratio of  in the last clause of

iambic and trochaic rhythms which are in the ratio of  or 




rather so i should say




but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an

effect of good or bad rhythm




none at all




and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style

and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is

that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them




just so he said they should follow the words




and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of

the soul




yes




and everything else on the style




yes




then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on

simplicityi mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered

mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for

folly




very true he replied




and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces

and harmonies their perpetual aim




they must




and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art

are full of themweaving embroidery architecture and every kind of

manufacture also nature animal and vegetablein all of them there is

grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion

are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the

twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness




that is quite true he said




but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be

required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if

they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to

be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from

exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and

indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who

cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in

our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not

have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious

pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by

day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of

corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to

discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth

dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in

everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye

and ear like a healthgiving breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw

the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of

reason




there can be no nobler training than that he replied




and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument

than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward

places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making

the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is illeducated

ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the

inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature

and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his

soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the

bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason

why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom

his education has made him long familiar




yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be

trained in music and on the grounds which you mention




just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters

of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and

combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space

large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking

ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they

are found




true




or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror

only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the

knowledge of both




exactly




even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate

can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms of

temperance courage liberality magnificence and their kindred as well as

the contrary forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their

images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or

great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study




most assuredly




and when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form and the two are

cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to

see it




the fairest indeed




and the fairest is also the loveliest




that may be assumed




and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the

loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul




that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any

merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the

same




i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i

agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity

to temperance




how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his

faculties quite as much as pain




or any affinity to virtue in general




none whatever




any affinity to wantonness and intemperance




yes the greatest




and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love




no nor a madder




whereas true love is a love of beauty and ordertemperate and harmonious




quite true he said




then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love




certainly not




then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover

and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of

the right sort




no indeed socrates it must never come near them




then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to

the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a

father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must

first have the others consent and this rule is to limit him in all his

intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is

to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste




i quite agree he said




thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of

music if not the love of beauty




i agree he said




after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained




certainly




gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it

should be careful and should continue through life now my belief isand

this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation

of my own but my own belief isnot that the good body by any bodily

excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her

own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you

say




yes i agree




then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over

the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will

now only give the general outlines of the subject




very good




that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for

of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in

the world he is




yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of

him is ridiculous indeed




but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the

great contest of allare they not




yes he said




and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them




why not




i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy

sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these

athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if

they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen




yes i do




then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior

athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost

keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and

winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not

be liable to break down in health




that is my view




the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we

were just now describing




how so




why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and

good and especially the military gymnastic




what do you mean




my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their

feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish

although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed

boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers

requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of

carrying about pots and pans




true




and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned

in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional

athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take

nothing of the kind




yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them




then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of

sicilian cookery




i think not




nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian

girl as his fair friend




certainly not




neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian

confectionary




certainly not




all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song

composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms




exactly




there complexity engendered licence and here disease whereas simplicity in

music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of

health in the body




most true he said




but when intemperance and diseases multiply in a state halls of justice and

medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer

give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the

slaves but the freemen of a city take about them




of course




and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of

education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need

the skill of firstrate physicians and judges but also those who would profess

to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of

want of goodbreeding that a man should have to go abroad for his law and

physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender

himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him




of all things he said the most disgraceful




would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a

further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a lifelong litigant

passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is

actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he

imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn

and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of

the way of justice and all for whatin order to gain small points not

worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do

without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that

still more disgraceful




yes he said that is still more disgraceful




well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be

cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a

habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters

and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of

asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is

not this too a disgrace




yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to

diseases




yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days

of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus

after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well

besprinkled with barleymeal and grated cheese which are certainly

inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not

blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating

his case




well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person

in his condition




not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is

commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not

practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases

but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a

combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and

chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world




how was that he said




by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he

perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his

entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself

and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual

regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age




a rare reward of his skill




yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood

that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the

omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of

medicine but because he knew that in all wellordered states every individual

has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to

spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but

ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort




how do you mean he said




i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and

ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knifethese are his

remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells

him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he

replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a

life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary

employment and therefore bidding goodbye to this sort of physician he

resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his

business or if his constitution fails he dies and has no more trouble




yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of

medicine thus far only




has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life

if he were deprived of his occupation




quite true he said




but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any

specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live




he is generally supposed to have nothing to do




then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a

livelihood he should practise virtue




nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner




let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask

ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live

without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question

whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of

the mind in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the

way of the sentiment of phocylides




of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body

when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of

virtue




yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a

house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all

irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or

selfreflectionthere is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness

are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of

virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying

that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his

body




yes likely enough




and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power

of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and

habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and

operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the

state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not

have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did

not want to lengthen out goodfornothing lives or to have weak fathers

begetting weaker sonsif a man was not able to live in the ordinary way

he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use

either to himself or to the state




then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman




clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they

were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am

speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded

menelaus they




sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing

remedies




but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in

the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as

they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was

healthy and regular in his habits and even though he did happen to drink a

posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have

nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no

use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for

their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would

have declined to attend them




they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius




naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our

behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say

also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death

and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the

principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us

bothif he was the son of a god we maintain that he was not avaricious

or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god




all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you

ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those

who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not

the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral

natures




yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know

whom i think good




will you tell me




i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two

things which are not the same




how so he asked




why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians

are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of

their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in

health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for

the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body

in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but

they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can

cure nothing




that is very true he said




but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not

therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with

them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime

only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their

bodily diseases from his own selfconsciousness the honourable mind which is

to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of

evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often

appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because

they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls




yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived




therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to

know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the

nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal

experience




yes he said that is the ideal of a judge




yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your

question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious

nature of which we spokehe who has committed many crimes and fancies

himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is

wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by

himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the

experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable

suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of

honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the

good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others

thought to be rather wise than foolish




most true he said




then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the

other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by

time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not

the vicious man has wisdomin my opinion




and in mine also




this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you will

sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health

both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will

leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to

themselves




that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state




and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we

said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law




clearly




and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the

simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme

case




that i quite believe




the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the

spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not

like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develope his muscles




very right he said




neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often

supposed the one for the training of the soul the other for the training of

the body




what then is the real object of them




i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the

improvement of the soul




how can that be he asked




did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive

devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to

music




in what way shown he said




the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and

effeminacy i replied




yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a

savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good

for him




yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly

educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become

hard and brutal




that i quite think




on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this

also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly

will be gentle and moderate




true




and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities




assuredly




and both should be in harmony




beyond question




and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous




yes




and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish




very true




and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through

the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we

were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the

delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which

is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and

useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next

stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut

out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior




very true




if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily

accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the

spirit renders him excitableon the least provocation he flames up at

once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable

and passionate and is quite impracticable




exactly




and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder

and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high

condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and he becomes twice the

man that he was




certainly




and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no converse with the muses

does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of

any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and

blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not

being purged of their mists




true he said




and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the

weapon of persuasionhe is like a wild beast all violence and

fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance

and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace




that is quite true he said




and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other

the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts

answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that

these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or

drawn tighter until they are duly harmonized




that appears to be the intention




and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best

attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and

harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings




you are quite right socrates




and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the

government is to last




yes he will be absolutely necessary




such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use

of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their

hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all

follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no

difficulty in discovering them




i dare say that there will be no difficulty




very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to

be rulers and who subjects




certainly




there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger




clearly




and that the best of these must rule




that is also clear




now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry




yes




and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be

those who have most the character of guardians




yes




and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care

of the state




true




and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves




to be sure




and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same

interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed

by him at any time most to affect his own




very true he replied




then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in

their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of

their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests




those are the right men




and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether

they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force

or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state




how cast off he said




i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mans mind

either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a

falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a

truth




i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the

unwilling i have yet to learn




why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and

willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the

truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to

possess the truth




yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of

truth against their will




and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or

enchantment




still he replied i do not understand you




i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean

that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals

away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now

you understand me




yes




those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief

compels to change their opinion




i understand he said and you are quite right




and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their

minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence

of fear




yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant




therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians

of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be

the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make

them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived

and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who fails in

the trial is to be rejected that will be the way




yes




and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in

which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities




very right he replied




and then i said we must try them with enchantmentsthat is the third

sort of testand see what will be their behaviour like those who take

colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we

take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures

and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may

discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble

bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have

learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious

nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state

and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of

the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the

state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and

other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who

fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in

which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak

generally and not with any pretension to exactness




and speaking generally i agree with you he said




and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be

applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and

maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will

or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called

guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the

principles of the rulers




i agree with you he said




how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately

spokejust one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be

possible and at any rate the rest of the city




what sort of lie he said




nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale laws of what has often

occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world

believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could

ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did




how your words seem to hesitate on your lips




you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard




speak he said and fear not




well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the

face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to

communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to

the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education

and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during

all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where

they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they

were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country

being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good

and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as

children of the earth and their own brothers




you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to

tell




true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens

we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you

differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of

these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others

he has made of silver to be auxiliaries others again who are to be husbandmen

and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally

be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a

golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden

son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else

that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard or of which they

are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should

observe what elements mingle in their offspring for if the son of a golden or

silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a

transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards

the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or

artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold

or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries

for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will

be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens

believe in it




not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing

this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons

sons and posterity after them




i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make

them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the

fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our

earthborn heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let

them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection

if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who

like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and

when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare

their dwellings




just so he said




and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter

and the heat of summer




i suppose that you mean houses he replied




yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of shopkeepers




what is the difference he said




that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want

of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep

and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and

monstrous thing in a shepherd




truly monstrous he said




and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger

than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage

tyrants instead of friends and allies




yes great care should be taken




and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard




but they are welleducated already he replied




i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much more certain that

they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the

greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one

another and to those who are under their protection




very true he replied




and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to

them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor

tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge

that




he must




then now let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize

our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of

his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private

house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions

should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of

temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed

rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will

go to mess and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will

tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they

have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not

to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal

has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they

alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under

the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be

their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they

ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become

housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead

of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being

plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of

internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and

to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say

that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations

appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters




yes said glaucon




 book iv


here adeimantus interposed a question how would you answer socrates said he

if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable and that

they are the cause of their own unhappiness the city in fact belongs to them

but they are none the better for it whereas other men acquire lands and build

large and handsome houses and have everything handsome about them offering

sacrifices to the gods on their own account and practising hospitality

moreover as you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that

is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are no better

than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard




yes i said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid in addition

to their food like other men and therefore they cannot if they would take a

journey of pleasure they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other

luxurious fancy which as the world goes is thought to be happiness and many

other accusations of the same nature might be added




but said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge




you mean to ask i said what will be our answer




yes




if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the

answer and our answer will be that even as they are our guardians may very

likely be the happiest of men but that our aim in founding the state was not

the disproportionate happiness of any one class but the greatest happiness of

the whole we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good

of the whole we should be most likely to find justice and in the illordered

state injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the two

is the happier at present i take it we are fashioning the happy state not

piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens but as a whole and

byandby we will proceed to view the opposite kind of state suppose that we

were painting a statue and some one came up to us and said why do you not put

the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the bodythe

eyes ought to be purple but you have made them blackto him we might

fairly answer sir you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a

degree that they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this

and the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful and

so i say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of

happiness which will make them anything but guardians for we too can clothe

our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns of gold on their heads and bid

them till the ground as much as they like and no more our potters also might

be allowed to repose on couches and feast by the fireside passing round the

winecup while their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only

as much as they like in this way we might make every class happyand

then as you imagine the whole state would be happy but do not put this idea

into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a

husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter and no one will have the

character of any distinct class in the state now this is not of much

consequence where the corruption of society and pretension to be what you are

not is confined to cobblers but when the guardians of the laws and of the

government are only seeming and not real guardians then see how they turn the

state upside down and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving

order and happiness to the state we mean our guardians to be true saviours and

not the destroyers of the state whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants

at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not of citizens who are

doing their duty to the state but if so we mean different things and he is

speaking of something which is not a state and therefore we must consider

whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness

individually or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in

the state as a whole but if the latter be the truth then the guardians and

auxiliaries and all others equally with them must be compelled or induced to

do their own work in the best way and thus the whole state will grow up in a

noble order and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness

which nature assigns to them




i think that you are quite right




i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me




what may that be




there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts




what are they




wealth i said and poverty




how do they act




the process is as follows when a potter becomes rich will he think you any

longer take the same pains with his art




certainly not




he will grow more and more indolent and careless




very true




and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter




yes he greatly deteriorates




but on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself with

tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will he teach

his sons or apprentices to work equally well




certainly not




then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their

work are equally liable to degenerate




that is evident




here then is a discovery of new evils i said against which the guardians

will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved




what evils




wealth i said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and

the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent




that is very true he replied but still i should like to know socrates how

our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy who is rich and

powerful if deprived of the sinews of war




there would certainly be a difficulty i replied in going to war with one such

enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two of them




how so he asked




in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be trained

warriors fighting against an army of rich men




that is true he said




and do you not suppose adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect in his

art would easily be a match for two stout and welltodo gentlemen who were not

boxers




hardly if they came upon him at once




what now i said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the

one who first came up and supposing he were to do this several times under the

heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert overturn more than one

stout personage




certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that




and yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and

practise of boxing than they have in military qualities




likely enough




then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three

times their own number




i agree with you for i think you right




and suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to one of the

two cities telling them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor

are permitted to have but you may do you therefore come and help us in war

and take the spoils of the other city who on hearing these words would

choose to fight against lean wiry dogs rather than with the dogs on their

side against fat and tender sheep




that is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the

wealth of many states were to be gathered into one




but how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own




why so




you ought to speak of other states in the plural number not one of them is a

city but many cities as they say in the game for indeed any city however

small is in fact divided into two one the city of the poor the other of the

rich these are at war with one another and in either there are many smaller

divisions and you would be altogether beside the mark if you treated them all

as a single state but if you deal with them as many and give the wealth or

power or persons of the one to the others you will always have a great many

friends and not many enemies and your state while the wise order which has

now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest of

states i do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in deed and

truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders a single state

which is her equal you will hardly find either among hellenes or barbarians

though many that appear to be as great and many times greater




that is most true he said




and what i said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are

considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which they are to

include and beyond which they will not go




what limit would you propose




i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity that i

think is the proper limit




very good he said




here then i said is another order which will have to be conveyed to our

guardians let our city be accounted neither large nor small but one and

selfsufficing




and surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose upon them




and the other said i of which we were speaking before is lighter

stilli mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when

inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the

lower classes when naturally superior the intention was that in the case of

the citizens generally each individual should be put to the use for which

nature intended him one to one work and then every man would do his own

business and be one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not

many




yes he said that is not so difficult




the regulations which we are prescribing my good adeimantus are not as might

be supposed a number of great principles but trifles all if care be taken

as the saying is of the one great thinga thing however which i would

rather call not great but sufficient for our purpose




what may that be he asked




education i said and nurture if our citizens are well educated and grow

into sensible men they will easily see their way through all these as well as

other matters which i omit such for example as marriage the possession of

women and the procreation of children which will all follow the general

principle that friends have all things in common as the proverb says




that will be the best way of settling them




also i said the state if once started well moves with accumulating force

like a wheel for good nurture and education implant good constitutions and

these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more and more

and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other animals




very possibly he said




then to sum up this is the point to which above all the attention of our

rulers should be directedthat music and gymnastic be preserved in their

original form and no innovation made they must do their utmost to maintain

them intact and when any one says that mankind most regard




the newest song which the singers have




they will be afraid that he may be praising not new songs but a new kind of

song and this ought not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the

poet for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state and

ought to be prohibited so damon tells me and i can quite believe

himhe says that when modes of music change the fundamental laws of the

state always change with them




yes said adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to damons and your

own




then i said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in

music




yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in




yes i replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears

harmless




why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by little this

spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates into manners and

customs whence issuing with greater force it invades contracts between man

and man and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions in utter

recklessness ending at last socrates by an overthrow of all rights private

as well as public




is that true i said




that is my belief he replied




then as i was saying our youth should be trained from the first in a stricter

system for if amusements become lawless and the youths themselves become

lawless they can never grow up into wellconducted and virtuous citizens




very true he said




and when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help of music have

gained the habit of good order then this habit of order in a manner how

unlike the lawless play of the others will accompany them in all their actions

and be a principle of growth to them and if there be any fallen places in the

state will raise them up again




very true he said




thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which their

predecessors have altogether neglected




what do you mean




i mean such things as thesewhen the young are to be silent before their

elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit

what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes are to be worn the mode

of dressing the hair deportment and manners in general you would agree with

me




yes




but there is i think small wisdom in legislating about such mattersi

doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments about them

likely to be lasting




impossible




it would seem adeimantus that the direction in which education starts a man

will determine his future life does not like always attract like




to be sure




until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good and may be

the reverse of good




that is not to be denied




and for this reason i said i shall not attempt to legislate further about

them




naturally enough he replied




well and about the business of the agora and the ordinary dealings between

man and man or again about agreements with artisans about insult and injury

or the commencement of actions and the appointment of juries what would you

say there may also arise questions about any impositions and exactions of

market and harbour dues which may be required and in general about the

regulations of markets police harbours and the like but oh heavens shall

we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars




i think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men

what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves




yes i said my friend if god will only preserve to them the laws which we

have given them




and without divine help said adeimantus they will go on for ever making and

mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection




you would compare them i said to those invalids who having no

selfrestraint will not leave off their habits of intemperance




exactly




yes i said and what a delightful life they lead they are always doctoring

and increasing and complicating their disorders and always fancying that they

will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try




such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort




yes i replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst enemy

who tells them the truth which is simply that unless they give up eating and

drinking and wenching and idling neither drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet

nor any other remedy will avail




charming he replied i see nothing charming in going into a passion with a man

who tells you what is right




these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good graces




assuredly not




nor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men whom i was

just now describing for are there not illordered states in which the citizens

are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution and yet he who

most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and

fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is

held to be a great and good statesmando not these states resemble the

persons whom i was describing




yes he said the states are as bad as the men and i am very far from praising

them




but do you not admire i said the coolness and dexterity of these ready

ministers of political corruption




yes he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom the

applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really

statesmen and these are not much to be admired




what do you mean i said you should have more feeling for them when a man

cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is

four cubits high can he help believing what they say




nay he said certainly not in that case




well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as a play

trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing they are always

fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts and

the other rascalities which i was mentioning not knowing that they are in

reality cutting off the heads of a hydra




yes he said that is just what they are doing




i conceive i said that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this

class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an

illordered or in a wellordered state for in the former they are quite

useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty in devising them and

many of them will naturally flow out of our previous regulations




what then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation




nothing to us i replied but to apollo the god of delphi there remains the

ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all




which are they he said




the institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service of gods

demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories of the dead and

the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the inhabitants

of the world below these are matters of which we are ignorant ourselves and

as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter

but our ancestral deity he is the god who sits in the centre on the navel of

the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind




you are right and we will do as you propose




but where amid all this is justice son of ariston tell me where now that

our city has been made habitable light a candle and search and get your

brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help and let us see

where in it we can discover justice and where injustice and in what they

differ from one another and which of them the man who would be happy should

have for his portion whether seen or unseen by gods and men




nonsense said glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying that for

you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety




i do not deny that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my

word but you must join




we will he replied




well then i hope to make the discovery in this way i mean to begin with the

assumption that our state if rightly ordered is perfect




that is most certain




and being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just




that is likewise clear




and whichever of these qualities we find in the state the one which is not

found will be the residue




very good




if there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it

might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there

would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then

the fourth would clearly be the one left




very true he said




and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which are also

four in number




clearly




first among the virtues found in the state wisdom comes into view and in this

i detect a certain peculiarity




what is that




the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in

counsel




very true




and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance but by

knowledge do men counsel well




clearly




and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse




of course




there is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge

which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel




certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill in

carpentering




then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which

counsels for the best about wooden implements




certainly not




nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots i said nor as

possessing any other similar knowledge




not by reason of any of them he said




nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that would give

the city the name of agricultural




yes




well i said and is there any knowledge in our recentlyfounded state among

any of the citizens which advises not about any particular thing in the state

but about the whole and considers how a state can best deal with itself and

with other states




there certainly is




and what is this knowledge and among whom is it found i asked




it is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and is found among those whom

we were just now describing as perfect guardians




and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of

knowledge




the name of good in counsel and truly wise




and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths




the smiths he replied will be far more numerous




will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name

from the profession of some kind of knowledge




much the smallest




and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge which

resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole state being

thus constituted according to nature will be wise and this which has the

only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has been ordained by nature to be of

all classes the least




most true




thus then i said the nature and place in the state of one of the four

virtues has somehow or other been discovered




and in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied




again i said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage and in

what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to the state




how do you mean




why i said every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly will be

thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the states

behalf




no one he replied would ever think of any other




the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their

courage or cowardice will not as i conceive have the effect of making the

city either the one or the other




certainly not




the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which preserves

under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things to be feared

and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them and this is what

you term courage




i should like to hear what you are saying once more for i do not think that i

perfectly understand you




i mean that courage is a kind of salvation




salvation of what




of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of what

nature which the law implants through education and i mean by the words

under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure or in pain

or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves and does not lose

this opinion shall i give you an illustration




if you please




you know i said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making the true

seapurple begin by selecting their white colour first this they prepare and

dress with much care and pains in order that the white ground may take the

purple hue in full perfection the dyeing then proceeds and whatever is dyed

in this manner becomes a fast colour and no washing either with lyes or

without them can take away the bloom but when the ground has not been duly

prepared you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any

other colour




yes he said i know that they have a washedout and ridiculous appearance




then now i said you will understand what our object was in selecting our

soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving

influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection

and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion was to

be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training not to be washed away by such

potent lyes as pleasuremightier agent far in washing the soul than any

soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desire the mightiest of all other

solvents and this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity

with law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage unless

you disagree




but i agree he replied for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere

uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slavethis in

your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought to have

another name




most certainly




then i may infer courage to be such as you describe




why yes said i you may and if you add the words of a citizen

you will not be far wronghereafter if you like we will carry the

examination further but at present we are seeking not for courage but justice

and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough




you are right he replied




two virtues remain to be discovered in the statefirst temperance and

then justice which is the end of our search




very true




now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance




i do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do i desire that

justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of and therefore

i wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first




certainly i replied i should not be justified in refusing your request




then consider he said




yes i replied i will and as far as i can at present see the virtue of

temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the preceding




how so he asked




temperance i replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and

desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a man being

his own master and other traces of the same notion may be found in

language




no doubt he said




there is something ridiculous in the expression master of

himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master

and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted




certainly




the meaning is i believe that in the human soul there is a better and also a

worse principle and when the better has the worse under control then a man is

said to be master of himself and this is a term of praise but when owing to

evil education or association the better principle which is also the smaller

is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worsein this case he is blamed

and is called the slave of self and unprincipled




yes there is reason in that




and now i said look at our newlycreated state and there you will find one

of these two conditions realized for the state as you will acknowledge may

be justly called master of itself if the words temperance and

selfmastery truly express the rule of the better part over the

worse




yes he said i see that what you say is true




let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and

pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the

freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class




certainly he said




whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are under the

guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only in a few and those the

best born and best educated




very true




these two as you may perceive have a place in our state and the meaner

desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the

few




that i perceive he said




then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures

and desires and master of itself ours may claim such a designation




certainly he replied




it may also be called temperate and for the same reasons




yes




and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the

question who are to rule that again will be our state




undoubtedly




and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class will

temperance be foundin the rulers or in the subjects




in both as i should imagine he replied




do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a

sort of harmony




why so




why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which resides in

a part only the one making the state wise and the other valiant not so

temperance which extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the

scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle

class whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or

numbers or wealth or anything else most truly then may we deem temperance to

be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to

rule of either both in states and individuals




i entirely agree with you




and so i said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been

discovered in our state the last of those qualities which make a state

virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was




the inference is obvious




the time then has arrived glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the

cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away and pass out of sight

and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country watch

therefore and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me

know




would that i could but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just

eyes enough to see what you show himthat is about as much as i am good

for




offer up a prayer with me and follow




i will but you must show me the way




here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplexing still we must

push on




let us push on




here i saw something halloo i said i begin to perceive a track and i

believe that the quarry will not escape




good news he said




truly i said we are stupid fellows




why so




why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there was justice

tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing could be more

ridiculous like people who go about looking for what they have in their

handsthat was the way with uswe looked not at what we were

seeking but at what was far off in the distance and therefore i suppose we

missed her




what do you mean




i mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of

justice and have failed to recognise her




i grow impatient at the length of your exordium




well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you remember the

original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of the

state that one man should practise one thing only the thing to which his

nature was best adaptednow justice is this principle or a part of it




yes we often said that one man should do one thing only




further we affirmed that justice was doing ones own business and not

being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the

same to us




yes we said so




then to do ones own business in a certain way may be assumed to be

justice can you tell me whence i derive this inference




i cannot but i should like to be told




because i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state when

the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted and

that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all of them

and while remaining in them is also their preservative and we were saying that

if the three were discovered by us justice would be the fourth or remaining

one




that follows of necessity




if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence

contributes most to the excellence of the state whether the agreement of

rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which

the law ordains about the true nature of dangers or wisdom and watchfulness in

the rulers or whether this other which i am mentioning and which is found in

children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subjectthe

quality i mean of every one doing his own work and not being a busybody

would claim the palmthe question is not so easily answered




certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which




then the power of each individual in the state to do his own work appears to

compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance courage




yes he said




and the virtue which enters into this competition is justice




exactly




let us look at the question from another point of view are not the rulers in a

state those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law




certainly




and are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what

is anothers nor be deprived of what is his own




yes that is their principle




which is a just principle




yes




then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what

is a mans own and belongs to him




very true




think now and say whether you agree with me or not suppose a carpenter to be

doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter and suppose them

to exchange their implements or their duties or the same person to be doing

the work of both or whatever be the change do you think that any great harm

would result to the state




not much




but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader

having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his

followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way into the class of

warriors or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians for which he is

unfitted and either to take the implements or the duties of the other or when

one man is trader legislator and warrior all in one then i think you will

agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with

another is the ruin of the state




most true




seeing then i said that there are three distinct classes any meddling of one

with another or the change of one into another is the greatest harm to the

state and may be most justly termed evildoing




precisely




and the greatest degree of evildoing to ones own city would be termed

by you injustice




certainly




this then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliary

and the guardian each do their own business that is justice and will make the

city just




i agree with you




we will not i said be overpositive as yet but if on trial this conception

of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the state there will be

no longer any room for doubt if it be not verified we must have a fresh

enquiry first let us complete the old investigation which we began as you

remember under the impression that if we could previously examine justice on

the larger scale there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the

individual that larger example appeared to be the state and accordingly we

constructed as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good state

justice would be found let the discovery which we made be now applied to the

individualif they agree we shall be satisfied or if there be a

difference in the individual we will come back to the state and have another

trial of the theory the friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly

strike a light in which justice will shine forth and the vision which is then

revealed we will fix in our souls




that will be in regular course let us do as you say




i proceeded to ask when two things a greater and less are called by the same

name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same




like he replied




the just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be like the just

state




he will




and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the state

severally did their own business and also thought to be temperate and valiant

and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same

classes




true he said




and so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three principles

in his own soul which are found in the state and he may be rightly described

in the same terms because he is affected in the same manner




certainly he said




once more then o my friend we have alighted upon an easy

questionwhether the soul has these three principles or not




an easy question nay rather socrates the proverb holds that hard is the

good




very true i said and i do not think that the method which we are employing is

at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question the true method is

another and a longer one still we may arrive at a solution not below the level

of the previous enquiry




may we not be satisfied with that he saidunder the circumstances i am

quite content




i too i replied shall be extremely well satisfied




then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said




must we not acknowledge i said that in each of us there are the same

principles and habits which there are in the state and that from the

individual they pass into the statehow else can they come there take

the quality of passion or spiritit would be ridiculous to imagine that

this quality when found in states is not derived from the individuals who are

supposed to possess it eg the thracians scythians and in general the

northern nations and the same may be said of the love of knowledge which is

the special characteristic of our part of the world or of the love of money

which may with equal truth be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians




exactly so he said




there is no difficulty in understanding this




none whatever




but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these

principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn with one part of

our nature are angry with another and with a third part desire the

satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether the whole soul comes into

play in each sort of actionto determine that is the difficulty




yes he said there lies the difficulty




then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different




how can we he asked




i replied as follows the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the

same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time in contrary ways

and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things apparently the same

we know that they are really not the same but different




good




for example i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same

time in the same part




impossible




still i said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest we should

hereafter fall out by the way imagine the case of a man who is standing and

also moving his hands and his head and suppose a person to say that one and

the same person is in motion and at rest at the same momentto such a

mode of speech we should object and should rather say that one part of him is

in motion while another is at rest




very true




and suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice

distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round

with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time

and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot his

objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at

rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that

they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for

there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes

round but if while revolving the axis inclines either to the right or left

forwards or backwards then in no point of view can they be at rest




that is the correct mode of describing them he replied




then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe that

the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation to the same

thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways




certainly not according to my way of thinking




yet i said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections and

prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity and go

forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption turn out to be

untrue all the consequences which follow shall be withdrawn




yes he said that will be the best way




well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire and aversion

attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites whether they are regarded

as active or passive for that makes no difference in the fact of their

opposition




yes he said they are opposites




well i said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and again

willing and wishingall these you would refer to the classes already

mentioned you would saywould you notthat the soul of him who

desires is seeking after the object of his desire or that he is drawing to

himself the thing which he wishes to possess or again when a person wants

anything to be given him his mind longing for the realization of his desire

intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a

question




very true




and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire

should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection




certainly




admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular

class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as they

are termed which are the most obvious of them




let us take that class he said




the object of one is food and of the other drink




yes




and here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink

and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything else for example warm

or cold or much or little or in a word drink of any particular sort but if

the thirst be accompanied by heat then the desire is of cold drink or if

accompanied by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then

the drink which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity of

drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and

simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst as food is of hunger




yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the simple

object and the qualified desire of the qualified object




but here a confusion may arise and i should wish to guard against an opponent

starting up and saying that no man desires drink only but good drink or food

only but good food for good is the universal object of desire and thirst

being a desire will necessarily be thirst after good drink and the same is

true of every other desire




yes he replied the opponent might have something to say




nevertheless i should still maintain that of relatives some have a quality

attached to either term of the relation others are simple and have their

correlatives simple




i do not know what you mean




well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less




certainly




and the much greater to the much less




yes




and the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that is to be to

the less that is to be




certainly he said




and so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the double and

the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower

and of hot and cold and of any other relativesis not this true of all

of them




yes




and does not the same principle hold in the sciences the object of science is

knowledge assuming that to be the true definition but the object of a

particular science is a particular kind of knowledge i mean for example that

the science of housebuilding is a kind of knowledge which is defined and

distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture




certainly




because it has a particular quality which no other has




yes




and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular

kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences




yes




now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my original meaning

in what i said about relatives my meaning was that if one term of a relation

is taken alone the other is taken alone if one term is qualified the other

is also qualified i do not mean to say that relatives may not be disparate or

that the science of health is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or

that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that

when the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified object

which in this case is the nature of health and disease it becomes defined and

is hence called not merely science but the science of medicine




i quite understand and i think as you do




would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms

having clearly a relation




yes thirst is relative to drink




and a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink but thirst

taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good nor bad nor of any

particular kind of drink but of drink only




certainly




then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires only

drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it




that is plain




and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink that

must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to

drink for as we were saying the same thing cannot at the same time with the

same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same




impossible




no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the bow at

the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes and the other pulls




exactly so he replied




and might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink




yes he said it constantly happens




and in such a case what is one to say would you not say that there was

something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else forbidding

him which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him




i should say so




and the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which bids and

attracts proceeds from passion and disease




clearly




then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ from one

another the one with which a man reasons we may call the rational principle

of the soul the other with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels

the flutterings of any other desire may be termed the irrational or

appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions




yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different




then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in the

soul and what of passion or spirit is it a third or akin to one of the

preceding




i should be inclined to sayakin to desire




well i said there is a story which i remember to have heard and in which i

put faith the story is that leontius the son of aglaion coming up one day

from the piraeus under the north wall on the outside observed some dead

bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution he felt a desire to see

them and also a dread and abhorrence of them for a time he struggled and

covered his eyes but at length the desire got the better of him and forcing

them open he ran up to the dead bodies saying look ye wretches take your

fill of the fair sight




i have heard the story myself he said




the moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire as

though they were two distinct things




yes that is the meaning he said




and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a mans

desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself and is angry at

the violence within him and that in this struggle which is like the struggle

of factions in a state his spirit is on the side of his reasonbut for

the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason

decides that she should not be opposed is a sort of thing which i believe that

you never observed occurring in yourself nor as i should imagine in any one

else




certainly not




suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler he is the

less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such as hunger or cold or

any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon himthese he

deems to be just and as i say his anger refuses to be excited by them




true he said




but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils and

chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice and because he

suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to

persevere and conquer his noble spirit will not be quelled until he either

slays or is slain or until he hears the voice of the shepherd that is

reason bidding his dog bark no more




the illustration is perfect he replied and in our state as we were saying

the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of the rulers who are

their shepherds




i perceive i said that you quite understand me there is however a further

point which i wish you to consider




what point




you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of

desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in the conflict of the

soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle




most assuredly




but a further question arises is passion different from reason also or only a

kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul

there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the

state was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may

there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit

and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason




yes he said there must be a third




yes i replied if passion which has already been shown to be different from

desire turn out also to be different from reason




but that is easily provedwe may observe even in young children that

they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas some of them

never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late enough




excellent i said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a

further proof of the truth of what you are saying and we may once more appeal

to the words of homer which have been already quoted by us




he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul




for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the

better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by

it




very true he said




and so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed that

the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the individual and

that they are three in number




exactly




must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way and in

virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise




certainly




also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state constitutes

courage in the individual and that both the state and the individual bear the

same relation to all the other virtues




assuredly




and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in

which the state is just




that follows of course




we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each of the

three classes doing the work of its own class




we are not very likely to have forgotten he said




we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his

nature do their own work will be just and will do his own work




yes he said we must remember that too




and ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care of the

whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject

and ally




certainly




and as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring

them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and

lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by

harmony and rhythm




quite true he said




and these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly to know

their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which in each of us is

the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain over this

they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily

pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent soul no longer confined to her

own sphere should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her

naturalborn subjects and overturn the whole life of man




very true he said




both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the

whole body against attacks from without the one counselling and the other

fighting under his leader and courageously executing his commands and

counsels




true




and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain

the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear




right he replied




and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules and which

proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of

what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole




assuredly




and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in

friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and the two

subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule

and do not rebel




certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether in the state

or individual




and surely i said we have explained again and again how and by virtue of what

quality a man will be just




that is very certain




and is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different or is she

the same which we found her to be in the state




there is no difference in my opinion he said




because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace

instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying




what sort of instances do you mean




if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who

is trained in the principles of such a state will be less likely than the

unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver would any one deny this




no one he replied




will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft or treachery

either to his friends or to his country




never




neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements




impossible




no one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his father and

mother or to fail in his religious duties




no one




and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business whether in

ruling or being ruled




exactly so




are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is

justice or do you hope to discover some other




not i indeed




then our dream has been realized and the suspicion which we entertained at the

beginning of our work of construction that some divine power must have

conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been verified




yes certainly




and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and

the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and not

anothers was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was of use




clearly




but in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned however

not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and

concernment of man for the just man does not permit the several elements

within him to interfere with one another or any of them to do the work of

othershe sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and

his own law and at peace with himself and when he has bound together the

three principles within him which may be compared to the higher lower and

middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervalswhen he has

bound all these together and is no longer many but has become one entirely

temperate and perfectly adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to

act whether in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in

some affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling that

which preserves and cooperates with this harmonious condition just and good

action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom and that which at any

time impairs this condition he will call unjust action and the opinion which

presides over it ignorance




you have said the exact truth socrates




very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the

just state and the nature of justice in each of them we should not be telling

a falsehood




most certainly not




may we say so then




let us say so




and now i said injustice has to be considered




clearly




must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principlesa

meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the soul against

the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which is made by a rebellious

subject against a true prince of whom he is the natural vassalwhat is

all this confusion and delusion but injustice and intemperance and cowardice

and ignorance and every form of vice




exactly so




and if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning of acting

unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly will also be perfectly

clear




what do you mean he said




why i said they are like disease and health being in the soul just what

disease and health are in the body




how so he said




why i said that which is healthy causes health and that which is unhealthy

causes disease




yes




and just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice




that is certain




and the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government

of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation of disease is the

production of a state of things at variance with this natural order




true




and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and

government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the creation of

injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural

order




exactly so he said




then virtue is the health and beauty and wellbeing of the soul and vice the

disease and weakness and deformity of the same




true




and do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice




assuredly




still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice

has not been answered which is the more profitable to be just and act justly

and practise virtue whether seen or unseen of gods and men or to be unjust

and act unjustly if only unpunished and unreformed




in my judgment socrates the question has now become ridiculous we know that

when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer endurable though

pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and having all wealth and all

power and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle

is undermined and corrupted life is still worth having to a man if only he be

allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to

acquire justice and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them

both to be such as we have described




yes i said the question is as you say ridiculous still as we are near the

spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our own eyes

let us not faint by the way




certainly not he replied




come up hither i said and behold the various forms of vice those of them i

mean which are worth looking at




i am following you he replied proceed




i said the argument seems to have reached a height from which as from some

tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue is one but that

the forms of vice are innumerable there being four special ones which are

deserving of note




what do you mean he said




i mean i replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as there

are distinct forms of the state




how many




there are five of the state and five of the soul i said




what are they




the first i said is that which we have been describing and which may be said

to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly as rule is exercised

by one distinguished man or by many




true he replied




but i regard the two names as describing one form only for whether the

government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have been trained

in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental laws of the state will be

maintained




that is true he replied




 book v


such is the good and true city or state and the good and true man is of the

same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the evil is one

which affects not only the ordering of the state but also the regulation of

the individual soul and is exhibited in four forms




what are they he said




i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me

to succeed one another when polemarchus who was sitting a little way off

just beyond adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching forth his hand he

took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder and drew him towards

him leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in

his ear of which i only caught the words shall we let him off or what

shall we do




certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice




who is it i said whom you are refusing to let off




you he said




i repeated why am i especially not to be let off




why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole

chapter which is a very important part of the story and you fancy that we

shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as if it were selfevident to

everybody that in the matter of women and children friends have all

things in common




and was i not right adeimantus




yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything else

requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds please

therefore to say what sort of community you mean we have been long expecting

that you would tell us something about the family life of your

citizenshow they will bring children into the world and rear them when

they have arrived and in general what is the nature of this community of

women and childrenfor we are of opinion that the right or wrong

management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the

state for good or for evil and now since the question is still undetermined

and you are taking in hand another state we have resolved as you heard not

to let you go until you give an account of all this




to that resolution said glaucon you may regard me as saying agreed




and without more ado said thrasymachus you may consider us all to be equally

agreed




i said you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me what an argument

are you raising about the state just as i thought that i had finished and was

only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep and was reflecting how

fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then said you ask me to begin

again at the very foundation ignorant of what a hornets nest of words

you are stirring now i foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it




for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said

thrasymachusto look for gold or to hear discourse




yes but discourse should have a limit




yes socrates said glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit which wise

men assign to the hearing of such discourses but never mind about us take

heart yourself and answer the question in your own way what sort of community

of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians and how

shall we manage the period between birth and education which seems to require

the greatest care tell us how these things will be




yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many more doubts

arise about this than about our previous conclusions for the practicability of

what is said may be doubted and looked at in another point of view whether

the scheme if ever so practicable would be for the best is also doubtful

hence i feel a reluctance to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear

friend should turn out to be a dream only




fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you they are not

sceptical or hostile




i said my good friend i suppose that you mean to encourage me by these words




yes he said




then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement

which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed that i knew

what i was talking about to declare the truth about matters of high interest

which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him need occasion no fear

or faltering in his mind but to carry on an argument when you are yourself

only a hesitating enquirer which is my condition is a dangerous and slippery

thing and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at of which the fear

would be childish but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to

be sure of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall and i pray

nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter for i do

indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a

deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws and that is

a risk which i would rather run among enemies than among friends and therefore

you do well to encourage me




glaucon laughed and said well then socrates in case you and your argument do

us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the homicide and

shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and speak




well i said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from guilt

and what holds at law may hold in argument




then why should you mind




well i replied i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i perhaps

ought to have said before in the proper place the part of the men has been

played out and now properly enough comes the turn of the women of them i will

proceed to speak and the more readily since i am invited by you




for men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion of

arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and

children is to follow the path on which we originally started when we said

that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd




true




let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to

similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result

accords with our design




what do you mean




what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dogs divided

into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping

watch and in the other duties of dogs or do we entrust to the males the entire

and exclusive care of the flocks while we leave the females at home under the

idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them




no he said they share alike the only difference between them is that the

males are stronger and the females weaker




but can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they are bred

and fed in the same way




you cannot




then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have the same

nurture and education




yes




the education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic




yes




then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war which

they must practise like the men




that is the inference i suppose




i should rather expect i said that several of our proposals if they are

carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous




no doubt of it




yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in

the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they are no longer

young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty any more than the

enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent

the gymnasia




yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would be

thought ridiculous




but then i said as we have determined to speak our minds we must not fear

the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of innovation

how they will talk of womens attainments both in music and gymnastic

and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon horseback




very true he replied




yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law at the same

time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious not long

ago as we shall remind them the hellenes were of the opinion which is still

generally received among the barbarians that the sight of a naked man was

ridiculous and improper and when first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians

introduced the custom the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the

innovation




no doubt




but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far better

than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye vanished

before the better principle which reason asserted then the man was perceived

to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight but that

of folly and vice or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other

standard but that of the good




very true he replied




first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us

come to an understanding about the nature of woman is she capable of sharing

either wholly or partially in the actions of men or not at all and is the art

of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share that will be the

best way of commencing the enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest

conclusion




that will be much the best way




shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves in

this manner the adversarys position will not be undefended




why not he said




then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents they will say

socrates and glaucon no adversary need convict you for you yourselves

at the first foundation of the state admitted the principle that everybody was

to do the one work suited to his own nature and certainly if i am not

mistaken such an admission was made by us and do not the natures of

men and women differ very much indeed and we shall reply of course

they do then we shall be asked whether the tasks assigned to men and

to women should not be different and such as are agreeable to their different

natures certainly they should but if so have you not fallen

into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women whose natures are so

entirely different ought to perform the same actionswhat

defence will you make for us my good sir against any one who offers these

objections




that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and i shall and i

do beg of you to draw out the case on our side




these are the objections glaucon and there are many others of a like kind

which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant to take in hand any

law about the possession and nurture of women and children




by zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy




why yes i said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth whether

he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean he has to swim all

the same




very true




and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that

arions dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us




i suppose so he said




well then let us see if any way of escape can be found we

acknowledgeddid we not that different natures ought to have different

pursuits and that mens and womens natures are different and now

what are we sayingthat different natures ought to have the same

pursuitsthis is the inconsistency which is charged upon us




precisely




verily glaucon i said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction




why do you say so




because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his will when

he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing just because he cannot

define and divide and so know that of which he is speaking and he will pursue

a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair

discussion




yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to do with us

and our argument




a great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally

into a verbal opposition




in what way




why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that different

natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered at all what

was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or why we distinguished

them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to

the same natures




why no he said that was never considered by us




i said suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether

there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men and if

this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers we should forbid the

hairy men to be cobblers and conversely




that would be a jest he said




yes i said a jest and why because we never meant when we constructed the

state that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference but

only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is

engaged we should have argued for example that a physician and one who is in

mind a physician may be said to have the same nature




true




whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures




certainly




and if i said the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness for

any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be assigned

to one or the other of them but if the difference consists only in women

bearing and men begetting children this does not amount to a proof that a

woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should

receive and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and

their wives ought to have the same pursuits




very true he said




next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits or

arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of a man




that will be quite fair




and perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient answer on

the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there is no difficulty




yes perhaps




suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and then we

may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution of

women which would affect them in the administration of the state




by all means




let us say to him come now and we will ask you a questionwhen you

spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you mean to say that

one man will acquire a thing easily another with difficulty a little learning

will lead the one to discover a great deal whereas the other after much study

and application no sooner learns than he forgets or again did you mean that

the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the

other is a hindrance to himwould not these be the sort of differences

which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted




no one will deny that




and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all

these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female need i waste time

in speaking of the art of weaving and the management of pancakes and

preserves in which womankind does really appear to be great and in which for

her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd




you are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority of the

female sex although many women are in many things superior to many men yet on

the whole what you say is true




and if so my friend i said there is no special faculty of administration in

a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man has by virtue

of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both all the

pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but in all of them a woman is

inferior to a man




very true




then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women




that will never do




one woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and another

has no music in her nature




very true




and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and another is

unwarlike and hates gymnastics




certainly




and one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy one has

spirit and another is without spirit




that is also true




then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not was not the

selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort




yes




men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they differ

only in their comparative strength or weakness




obviously




and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions

and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in

capacity and in character




very true




and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits




they ought




then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning music

and gymnastic to the wives of the guardiansto that point we come round

again




certainly not




the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore not an

impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice which prevails at

present is in reality a violation of nature




that appears to be true




we had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and secondly

whether they were the most beneficial




yes




and the possibility has been acknowledged




yes




the very great benefit has next to be established




quite so




you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will

make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the same




yes




i should like to ask you a question




what is it




would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man better than

another




the latter




and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians

who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the

cobblers whose education has been cobbling




what a ridiculous question




you have answered me i replied well and may we not further say that our

guardians are the best of our citizens




by far the best




and will not their wives be the best women




yes by far the best




and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than that the

men and women of a state should be as good as possible




there can be nothing better




and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in such manner

as we have described will accomplish




certainly




then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree

beneficial to the state




true




then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be their robe

and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country only

in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women who

are the weaker natures but in other respects their duties are to be the same

and as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the

best of motives in his laughter he is plucking




a fruit of unripe wisdom




and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at or what he is

aboutfor that is and ever will be the best of sayings that the

useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base




very true




here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may say that we

have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive for enacting that the

guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in common to the

utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the consistency of the

argument with itself bears witness




yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped




yes i said but a greater is coming you will not think much of this when you

see the next




go on let me see




the law i said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded is

to the following effectthat the wives of our guardians are to be

common and their children are to be common and no parent is to know his own

child nor any child his parent




yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibility

as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable




i do not think i said that there can be any dispute about the very great

utility of having wives and children in common the possibility is quite

another matter and will be very much disputed




i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both




you imply that the two questions must be combined i replied now i meant that

you should admit the utility and in this way as i thought i should escape

from one of them and then there would remain only the possibility




but that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please to give a

defence of both




well i said i submit to my fate yet grant me a little favour let me feast

my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves

when they are walking alone for before they have discovered any means of

effecting their wishesthat is a matter which never troubles

themthey would rather not tire themselves by thinking about

possibilities but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them

they proceed with their plan and delight in detailing what they mean to do

when their wish has come truethat is a way which they have of not doing

much good to a capacity which was never good for much now i myself am

beginning to lose heart and i should like with your permission to pass over

the question of possibility at present assuming therefore the possibility of

the proposal i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry out

these arrangements and i shall demonstrate that our plan if executed will be

of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardians first of all then

if you have no objection i will endeavour with your help to consider the

advantages of the measure and hereafter the question of possibility




i have no objection proceed




first i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy of the

name which they bear there must be willingness to obey in the one and the

power of command in the other the guardians must themselves obey the laws and

they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are entrusted to

their care




that is right he said




you i said who are their legislator having selected the men will now select

the women and give them to themthey must be as far as possible of like

natures with them and they must live in common houses and meet at common

meals none of them will have anything specially his or her own they will be

together and will be brought up together and will associate at gymnastic

exercises and so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have

intercourse with each othernecessity is not too strong a word i think




yes he saidnecessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity

which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining to the

mass of mankind




true i said and this glaucon like all the rest must proceed after an

orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an unholy thing

which the rulers will forbid




yes he said and it ought not to be permitted




then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest

degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred




exactly




and how can marriages be made most beneficialthat is a question which i

put to you because i see in your house dogs for hunting and of the nobler

sort of birds not a few now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attended

to their pairing and breeding




in what particulars




why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not some

better than others




true




and do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care to breed from

the best only




from the best




and do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe age




i choose only those of ripe age




and if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would greatly

deteriorate




certainly




and the same of horses and animals in general




undoubtedly




good heavens my dear friend i said what consummate skill will our rulers

need if the same principle holds of the human species




certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any particular

skill




because i said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate

with medicines now you know that when patients do not require medicines but

have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practitioner is

deemed to be good enough but when medicine has to be given then the doctor

should be more of a man




that is quite true he said but to what are you alluding




i mean i replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood

and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we were saying that the

use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage




and we were very right




and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the regulations

of marriages and births




how so




why i said the principle has been already laid down that the best of either

sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior with the

inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear the offspring of the

one sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintained in

firstrate condition now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers

only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may

be termed breaking out into rebellion




very true




had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the

brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal

songs composed by our poets the number of weddings is a matter which must be

left to the discretion of the rulers whose aim will be to preserve the average

of population there are many other things which they will have to consider

such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as

far as this is possible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or

too small




certainly he replied




we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy may

draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and then they will accuse

their own illluck and not the rulers




to be sure he said




and i think that our braver and better youth besides their other honours and

rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given them

their bravery will be a reason and such fathers ought to have as many sons as

possible




true




and the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices are to be

held by women as well as by men




yes




the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or

fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a

separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior or of the better when they

chance to be deformed will be put away in some mysterious unknown place as

they should be




yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be kept

pure




they will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to the fold

when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible care that no mother

recognises her own child and other wetnurses may be engaged if more are

required care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be

protracted too long and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other

trouble but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and

attendants




you suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when they

are having children




why said i and so they ought let us however proceed with our scheme we

were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life




very true




and what is the prime of life may it not be defined as a period of about

twenty years in a womans life and thirty in a mans




which years do you mean to include




a woman i said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the

state and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin at

fiveandtwenty when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats

quickest and continue to beget children until he be fiftyfive




certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime of physical

as well as of intellectual vigour




any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public

hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing the child

of which he is the father if it steals into life will have been conceived

under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers which at each hymeneal

priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer that the new generation

may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents whereas his

child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust




very true he replied




and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age who

forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the sanction of

the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard to the state

uncertified and unconsecrated




very true he replied




this applies however only to those who are within the specified age after

that we allow them to range at will except that a man may not marry his

daughter or his daughters daughter or his mother or his mothers

mother and women on the other hand are prohibited from marrying their sons

or fathers or sons son or fathers father and so on in either

direction and we grant all this accompanying the permission with strict

orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light

and if any force a way to the birth the parents must understand that the

offspring of such an union cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly




that also he said is a reasonable proposition but how will they know who are

fathers and daughters and so on




they will never know the way will be thisdating from the day of the

hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children

who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons and the female

children his daughters and they will call him father and he will call their

children his grandchildren and they will call the elder generation

grandfathers and grandmothers all who were begotten at the time when their

fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters

and these as i was saying will be forbidden to intermarry this however is

not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and

sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the sanction of the pythian

oracle the law will allow them




quite right he replied




such is the scheme glaucon according to which the guardians of our state are

to have their wives and families in common and now you would have the argument

show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity and also

that nothing can be betterwould you not




yes certainly




shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the

chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a

statewhat is the greatest good and what is the greatest evil and then

consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the

evil




by all means




can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where

unity ought to reign or any greater good than the bond of unity




there cannot




and there is unity where there is community of pleasures and painswhere

all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow




no doubt




yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is

disorganizedwhen you have one half of the world triumphing and the other

plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens




certainly




such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the

terms mine and not mine his and

not his




exactly so




and is not that the bestordered state in which the greatest number of persons

apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way

to the same thing




quite true




or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the

individualas in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt the

whole frame drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom under

the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the

part affected and we say that the man has a pain in his finger and the same

expression is used about any other part of the body which has a sensation of

pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering




very true he replied and i agree with you that in the bestordered state

there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe




then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the whole state

will make his case their own and will either rejoice or sorrow with him




yes he said that is what will happen in a wellordered state




it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether this

or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental principles




very good




our state like every other has rulers and subjects




true




all of whom will call one another citizens




of course




but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other

states




generally they call them masters but in democratic states they simply call

them rulers




and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people give

the rulers




they are called saviours and helpers he replied




and what do the rulers call the people




their maintainers and fosterfathers




and what do they call them in other states




slaves




and what do the rulers call one another in other states




fellowrulers




and what in ours




fellowguardians




did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would speak of

one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend




yes very often




and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest and

the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest




exactly




but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a

stranger




certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them

either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as

the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him




capital i said but let me ask you once more shall they be a family in name

only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name for example in

the use of the word father would the care of a father be implied

and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands

and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and

unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands

of god or of man are these to be or not to be the strains which the children

will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are

intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk




these he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than for them

to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the

spirit of them




then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard

than in any other as i was describing before when any one is well or ill the

universal word will be with me it is well or it is

ill




most true




and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying that

they will have their pleasures and pains in common




yes and so they will




and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike

call my own and having this common interest they will have a

common feeling of pleasure and pain




yes far more so than in other states




and the reason of this over and above the general constitution of the state

will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children




that will be the chief reason




and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as was implied

in our own comparison of a wellordered state to the relation of the body and

the members when affected by pleasure or pain




that we acknowledged and very rightly




then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the

source of the greatest good to the state




certainly




and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirmingthat

the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property their pay

was to be their food which they were to receive from the other citizens and

they were to have no private expenses for we intended them to preserve their

true character of guardians




right he replied




both the community of property and the community of families as i am saying

tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear the city in pieces

by differing about mine and not mine each man

dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own

where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains but

all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because

they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefore

they all tend towards a common end




certainly he replied




and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own suits

and complaints will have no existence among them they will be delivered from

all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion




of course they will




neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among them

for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall maintain to be

honourable and right we shall make the protection of the person a matter of

necessity




that is good he said




yes and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man has a quarrel

with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there and not proceed to

more dangerous lengths




certainly




to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the younger




clearly




nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other

violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor will he slight

him in any way for there are two guardians shame and fear mighty to prevent

him shame which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are to them

in the relation of parents fear that the injured one will be succoured by the

others who are his brothers sons fathers




that is true he replied




then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one

another




yes there will be no want of peace




and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no

danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one

another




none whatever




i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will be rid

for they are beneath notice such for example as the flattery of the rich by

the poor and all the pains and pangs which men experience in bringing up a

family and in finding money to buy necessaries for their household borrowing

and then repudiating getting how they can and giving the money into the hands

of women and slaves to keepthe many evils of so many kinds which people

suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking

of




yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that




and from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will be blessed

as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed




how so




the olympic victor i said is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the

blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won a more glorious

victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost for the

victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole state and the crown

with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that life

needs they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living and

after death have an honourable burial




yes he said and glorious rewards they are




do you remember i said how in the course of the previous discussion some one

who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappythey had

nothing and might have possessed all thingsto whom we replied that if

an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter consider this question but

that as at present advised we would make our guardians truly guardians and

that we were fashioning the state with a view to the greatest happiness not of

any particular class but of the whole




yes i remember




and what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far

better and nobler than that of olympic victorsis the life of shoemakers

or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be compared with it




certainly not




at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere that if any

of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to

be a guardian and is not content with this safe and harmonious life which in

our judgment is of all lives the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit

of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole

state to himself then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke when he

said half is more than the whole




if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when you

have the offer of such a life




you agree then i said that men and women are to have a common way of life

such as we have describedcommon education common children and they are

to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out

to war they are to keep watch together and to hunt together like dogs and

always and in all things as far as they are able women are to share with the

men and in so doing they will do what is best and will not violate but

preserve the natural relation of the sexes




i agree with you he replied




the enquiry i said has yet to be made whether such a community be found

possibleas among other animals so also among menand if possible

in what way possible




you have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest




there is no difficulty i said in seeing how war will be carried on by them




how




why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take with them

any of their children who are strong enough that after the manner of the

artisans child they may look on at the work which they will have to do

when they are grown up and besides looking on they will have to help and be of

use in war and to wait upon their fathers and mothers did you never observe

in the arts how the potters boys look on and help long before they

touch the wheel




yes i have




and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving

them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians

will be




the idea is ridiculous he said




there is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other animals the

presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour




that is quite true socrates and yet if they are defeated which may often

happen in war how great the danger is the children will be lost as well as

their parents and the state will never recover




true i said but would you never allow them to run any risk




i am far from saying that




well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion

when if they escape disaster they will be the better for it




clearly




whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their youth is

a very important matter for the sake of which some risk may fairly be

incurred




yes very important




this then must be our first stepto make our children spectators of war

but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger then all

will be well




true




their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war but to know

as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe and what dangerous




that may be assumed




and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the

dangerous ones




true




and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be

their leaders and teachers




very properly




still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good deal of

chance about them




true




then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with wings in

order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape




what do you mean he said




i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth and when they

have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the horses must not be

spirited and warlike but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that can be

had in this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to be

their own business and if there is danger they have only to follow their elder

leaders and escape




i believe that you are right he said




next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another

and to their enemies i should be inclined to propose that the soldier who

leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is guilty of any other act of

cowardice should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan what do

you think




by all means i should say




and he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a present of

to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them do what they like with

him




certainly




but the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to him in the

first place he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades

every one of them in succession shall crown him what do you say




i approve




and what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship




to that too i agree




but you will hardly agree to my next proposal




what is your proposal




that he should kiss and be kissed by them




most certainly and i should be disposed to go further and say let no one

whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition

lasts so that if there be a lover in the army whether his love be youth or

maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of valour




capital i said that the brave man is to have more wives than others has been

already determined and he is to have first choices in such matters more than

others in order that he may have as many children as possible




agreed




again there is another manner in which according to homer brave youths

should be honoured for he tells how ajax after he had distinguished himself

in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be a compliment

appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being not only a tribute of

honour but also a very strengthening thing




most true he said




then in this i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices and

on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the measure of their

valour whether men or women with hymns and those other distinctions which we

were mentioning also with




seats of precedence and meats and full cups




and in honouring them we shall be at the same time training them




that he replied is excellent




yes i said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say in the

first place that he is of the golden race




to be sure




nay have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they are dead




they are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of evil

the guardians of speechgifted men




yes and we accept his authority




we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic

personages and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he

bids




by all means




and in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their sepulchres as

at the graves of heroes and not only they but any who are deemed preeminently

good whether they die from age or in any other way shall be admitted to the

same honours




that is very right he said




next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies what about this




in what respect do you mean




first of all in regard to slavery do you think it right that hellenes should

enslave hellenic states or allow others to enslave them if they can help

should not their custom be to spare them considering the danger which there is

that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians




to spare them is infinitely better




then no hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule which they

will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe




certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians and

will keep their hands off one another




next as to the slain ought the conquerors i said to take anything but their

armour does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not

facing the battle cowards skulk about the dead pretending that they are

fulfilling a duty and many an army before now has been lost from this love of

plunder




very true




and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and also a

degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when

the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind

himis not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant

quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead




very like a dog he said




then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial




yes he replied we most certainly must




neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of all the

arms of hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with other hellenes and

indeed we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen

may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself




very true




again as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of houses

what is to be the practice




may i have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion




both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produce and

no more shall i tell you why




pray do




why you see there is a difference in the names discord and

war and i imagine that there is also a difference in their

natures the one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of

what is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord and

only the second war




that is a very proper distinction he replied




and may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is all united

together by ties of blood and friendship and alien and strange to the

barbarians




very good he said




and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with hellenes

they will be described by us as being at war when they fight and by nature

enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called war but when hellenes

fight with one another we shall say that hellas is then in a state of disorder

and discord they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be called

discord




i agree




consider then i said when that which we have acknowledged to be discord

occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the lands and burn the

houses of one another how wicked does the strife appear no true lover of his

country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother there

might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest but

still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to

go on fighting for ever




yes he said that is a better temper than the other




and will not the city which you are founding be an hellenic city




it ought to be he replied




then will not the citizens be good and civilized




yes very civilized




and will they not be lovers of hellas and think of hellas as their own land

and share in the common temples




most certainly




and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord

onlya quarrel among friends which is not to be called a war




certainly not




then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled




certainly




they will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy their

opponents they will be correctors not enemies




just so




and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas nor will

they burn houses nor ever suppose that the whole population of a

citymen women and childrenare equally their enemies for they

know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the

many are their friends and for all these reasons they will be unwilling to

waste their lands and rase their houses their enmity to them will only last

until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give

satisfaction




i agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic

enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another




then let us enact this law also for our guardiansthat they are neither

to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses




agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these like all our previous

enactments are very good




but still i must say socrates that if you are allowed to go on in this way

you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this

discussion you thrust asideis such an order of things possible and

how if at all for i am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you

propose if only feasible would do all sorts of good to the state i will add

what you have omitted that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors and

will never leave their ranks for they will all know one another and each will

call the other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their

armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the

enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need i know that they will then be

absolutely invincible and there are many domestic advantages which might also

be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge but as i admit all these

advantages and as many more as you please if only this state of yours were to

come into existence we need say no more about them assuming then the

existence of the state let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways

and meansthe rest may be left




if i loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me i said and have

no mercy i have hardly escaped the first and second waves and you seem not to

be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third which is the greatest and

heaviest when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you will be more

considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural

respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and

investigate




the more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined are

we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible speak out and at once




let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search after

justice and injustice




true he replied but what of that




i was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are to require

that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice or may we be

satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in him of a higher degree

of justice than is to be found in other men




the approximation will be enough




we were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of

the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly unjust that we might

have an ideal we were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own

happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they exhibited and

the degree in which we resembled them but not with any view of showing that

they could exist in fact




true he said




would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated with

consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was unable to show

that any such man could ever have existed




he would be none the worse




well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state




to be sure




and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility

of a city being ordered in the manner described




surely not he replied




that is the truth i said but if at your request i am to try and show how

and under what conditions the possibility is highest i must ask you having

this in view to repeat your former admissions




what admissions




i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language does not the

word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatever a man may

think always in the nature of things fall short of the truth what do you

say




i agree




then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in every

respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover how a city may

be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that we have discovered the

possibility which you demand and will be contented i am sure that i should be

contentedwill not you




yes i will




let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the cause

of their present maladministration and what is the least change which will

enable a state to pass into the truer form and let the change if possible be

of one thing only or if not of two at any rate let the changes be as few

and slight as possible




certainly he replied




i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if only one change

were made which is not a slight or easy though still a possible one




what is it he said




now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the waves

yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in

laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words




proceed




i said until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this

world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and

wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the

exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have

rest from their evilsnor the human race as i believeand then

only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the light of

day such was the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have

uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant for to be convinced that in no

other state can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing




socrates what do you mean i would have you consider that the word which you

have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very respectable persons

too in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment and seizing any

weapon that comes to hand will run at you might and main before you know

where you are intending to do heaven knows what and if you dont

prepare an answer and put yourself in motion you will be pared by

their fine wits and no mistake




you got me into the scrape i said




and i was quite right however i will do all i can to get you out of it but i

can only give you goodwill and good advice and perhaps i may be able to fit

answers to your questions better than anotherthat is all and now

having such an auxiliary you must do your best to show the unbelievers that

you are right




i ought to try i said since you offer me such invaluable assistance and i

think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must explain to them

whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the state then we

shall be able to defend ourselves there will be discovered to be some natures

who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the state and others who

are not born to be philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than

leaders




then now for a definition he said




follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be able to give

you a satisfactory explanation




proceed




i dare say that you remember and therefore i need not remind you that a

lover if he is worthy of the name ought to show his love not to some one

part of that which he loves but to the whole




i really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my memory




another person i said might fairly reply as you do but a man of pleasure

like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow

or other raise a pang or emotion in a lovers breast and are thought by

him to be worthy of his affectionate regards is not this a way which you have

with the fair one has a snub nose and you praise his charming face the

hooknose of another has you say a royal look while he who is neither snub

nor hooked has the grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are

children of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are

called what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in

diminutives and is not averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth

in a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing which you

will not say in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the

springtime of youth




if you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the argument i

assent




and what do you say of lovers of wine do you not see them doing the same they

are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine




very good




and the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army they are

willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured by really great and

important persons they are glad to be honoured by lesser and meaner

peoplebut honour of some kind they must have




exactly




once more let me ask does he who desires any class of goods desire the whole

class or a part only




the whole




and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a part of

wisdom only but of the whole




yes of the whole




and he who dislikes learning especially in youth when he has no power of

judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not to be a

philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses his food is not

hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one




very true he said




whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to

learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher am i not

right




glaucon said if curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many a strange

being will have a title to the name all the lovers of sights have a delight in

learning and must therefore be included musical amateurs too are a folk

strangely out of place among philosophers for they are the last persons in the

world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion if they could

help while they run about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out

their ears to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or

countrythat makes no differencethey are there now are we to

maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the

professors of quite minor arts are philosophers




certainly not i replied they are only an imitation




he said who then are the true philosophers




those i said who are lovers of the vision of truth




that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean




to another i replied i might have a difficulty in explaining but i am sure

that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make




what is the proposition




that since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two




certainly




and inasmuch as they are two each of them is one




true again




and of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the same

remark holds taken singly each of them is one but from the various

combinations of them with actions and things and with one another they are

seen in all sorts of lights and appear many




very true




and this is the distinction which i draw between the sightloving artloving

practical class and those of whom i am speaking and who are alone worthy of

the name of philosophers




how do you distinguish them he said




the lovers of sounds and sights i replied are as i conceive fond of fine

tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are made out

of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty




true he replied




few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this




very true




and he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty

or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to

followof such an one i ask is he awake or in a dream only reflect is

not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens dissimilar things who puts

the copy in the place of the real object




i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming




but take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute beauty

and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the

idea neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the

place of the objectsis he a dreamer or is he awake




he is wide awake




and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge and that

the mind of the other who opines only has opinion




certainly




but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement

can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him without revealing to

him that there is sad disorder in his wits




we must certainly offer him some good advice he replied




come then and let us think of something to say to him shall we begin by

assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have and that we

are rejoiced at his having it but we should like to ask him a question does

he who has knowledge know something or nothing you must answer for him




i answer that he knows something




something that is or is not




something that is for how can that which is not ever be known




and are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of view that

absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that the utterly nonexistent

is utterly unknown




nothing can be more certain




good but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to

be that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute

negation of being




yes between them




and as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to

notbeing for that intermediate between being and notbeing there has to be

discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge if

there be such




certainly




do we admit the existence of opinion




undoubtedly




as being the same with knowledge or another faculty




another faculty




then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter

corresponding to this difference of faculties




yes




and knowledge is relative to being and knows being but before i proceed

further i will make a division




what division




i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are powers in

us and in all other things by which we do as we do sight and hearing for

example i should call faculties have i clearly explained the class which i

mean




yes i quite understand




then let me tell you my view about them i do not see them and therefore the

distinctions of figure colour and the like which enable me to discern the

differences of some things do not apply to them in speaking of a faculty i

think only of its sphere and its result and that which has the same sphere and

the same result i call the same faculty but that which has another sphere and

another result i call different would that be your way of speaking




yes




and will you be so very good as to answer one more question would you say that

knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place it




certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties




and is opinion also a faculty




certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to form an

opinion




and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the

same as opinion




why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is

infallible with that which errs




an excellent answer proving i said that we are quite conscious of a

distinction between them




yes




then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or

subjectmatters




that is certain




being is the sphere or subjectmatter of knowledge and knowledge is to know

the nature of being




yes




and opinion is to have an opinion




yes




and do we know what we opine or is the subjectmatter of opinion the same as

the subjectmatter of knowledge




nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in faculty

implies difference in the sphere or subjectmatter and if as we were saying

opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then the sphere of knowledge and

of opinion cannot be the same




then if being is the subjectmatter of knowledge something else must be the

subjectmatter of opinion




yes something else




well then is notbeing the subjectmatter of opinion or rather how can

there be an opinion at all about notbeing reflect when a man has an opinion

has he not an opinion about something can he have an opinion which is an

opinion about nothing




impossible




he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing




yes




and notbeing is not one thing but properly speaking nothing




true




of notbeing ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative of being

knowledge




true he said




then opinion is not concerned either with being or with notbeing




not with either




and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge




that seems to be true




but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater

clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than ignorance




in neither




then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge but

lighter than ignorance




both and in no small degree




and also to be within and between them




yes




then you would infer that opinion is intermediate




no question




but were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of a sort which

is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in

the interval between pure being and absolute notbeing and that the

corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance but will be found in

the interval between them




true




and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call

opinion




there has




then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the

nature of being and notbeing and cannot rightly be termed either pure and

simple this unknown term when discovered we may truly call the subject of

opinion and assign each to their proper facultythe extremes to the

faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean




true




this being premised i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is

no absolute or unchangeable idea of beautyin whose opinion the beautiful

is the manifoldhe i say your lover of beautiful sights who cannot

bear to be told that the beautiful is one and the just is one or that

anything is oneto him i would appeal saying will you be so very kind

sir as to tell us whether of all these beautiful things there is one which

will not be found ugly or of the just which will not be found unjust or of

the holy which will not also be unholy




no he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly and the

same is true of the rest




and may not the many which are doubles be also halvesdoubles that is

of one thing and halves of another




quite true




and things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will not be

denoted by these any more than by the opposite names




true both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them




and can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be

said to be this rather than not to be this




he replied they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the

childrens puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with what he hit

him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat was sitting the

individual objects of which i am speaking are also a riddle and have a double

sense nor can you fix them in your mind either as being or notbeing or

both or neither




then what will you do with them i said can they have a better place than

between being and notbeing for they are clearly not in greater darkness or

negation than notbeing or more full of light and existence than being




that is quite true he said




thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude

entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in

some region which is halfway between pure being and pure notbeing




we have




yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might find

was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledge being

the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty




quite true




then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute beauty

nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see the many just and

not absolute justice and the likesuch persons may be said to have

opinion but not knowledge




that is certain




but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know

and not to have opinion only




neither can that be denied




the one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge the other those of opinion

the latter are the same as i dare say you will remember who listened to sweet

sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would not tolerate the existence of

absolute beauty




yes i remember




shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion

rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry with us for thus

describing them




i shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what is true




but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of wisdom

and not lovers of opinion




assuredly




 book vi


and thus glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true and the

false philosophers have at length appeared in view




i do not think he said that the way could have been shortened




i suppose not i said and yet i believe that we might have had a better view

of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject

and if there were not many other questions awaiting us which he who desires to

see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must

consider




and what is the next question he asked




surely i said the one which follows next in order inasmuch as philosophers

only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who wander in

the region of the many and variable are not philosophers i must ask you which

of the two classes should be the rulers of our state




and how can we rightly answer that question




whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our

statelet them be our guardians




very good




neither i said can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep

anything should have eyes rather than no eyes




there can be no question of that




and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the

true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear pattern and are

unable as with a painters eye to look at the absolute truth and to that

original to repair and having perfect vision of the other world to order the

laws about beauty goodness justice in this if not already ordered and to

guard and preserve the order of themare not such persons i ask simply

blind




truly he replied they are much in that condition




and shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides being their

equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue also

know the very truth of each thing




there can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this greatest of

all great qualities they must always have the first place unless they fail in

some other respect




suppose then i said that we determine how far they can unite this and the

other excellences




by all means




in the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher has

to be ascertained we must come to an understanding about him and when we

have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledge that such

an union of qualities is possible and that those in whom they are united and

those only should be rulers in the state




what do you mean




let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which

shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption




agreed




and further i said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there

is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are

willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition




true




and if they are to be what we were describing is there not another quality

which they should also possess




what quality




truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood

which is their detestation and they will love the truth




yes that may be safely affirmed of them




may be my friend i replied is not the word say rather

must be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything

cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections




right he said




and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth




how can there be




can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood




never




the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far as in him

lies desire all truth




assuredly




but then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong in one

direction will have them weaker in others they will be like a stream which has

been drawn off into another channel




true




he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in

the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily pleasurei mean

if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one




that is most certain




such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for the

motives which make another man desirous of having and spending have no place

in his character




very true




another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered




what is that




there should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can be more

antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of

things both divine and human




most true he replied




then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time

and all existence think much of human life




he cannot




or can such an one account death fearful




no indeed




then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy




certainly not




or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous or mean

or a boaster or a cowardcan he i say ever be unjust or hard in his

dealings




impossible




then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and

unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the

philosophical nature from the unphilosophical




true




there is another point which should be remarked




what point




whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will love that

which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes little progress




certainly not




and again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns will he

not be an empty vessel




that is certain




labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation

yes




then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures

we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory




certainly




and once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to

disproportion




undoubtedly




and do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion




to proportion




then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally

wellproportioned and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the

true being of everything




certainly




well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating go

together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which is to have

a full and perfect participation of being




they are absolutely necessary he replied




and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the

gift of a good memory and is quick to learnnoble gracious the friend

of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred




the god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such a study




and to men like him i said when perfected by years and education and to

these only you will entrust the state




here adeimantus interposed and said to these statements socrates no one can

offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange feeling passes over the

minds of your hearers they fancy that they are led astray a little at each

step in the argument owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering

questions these littles accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are

found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear

to be turned upside down and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut

up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move so they too

find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing to say in this new game

of which words are the counters and yet all the time they are in the right

the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring for any one of us

might say that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of

the argument he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they

carry on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the

pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters not to

say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the best of them are

made useless to the world by the very study which you extol




well and do you think that those who say so are wrong




i cannot tell he replied but i should like to know what is your opinion




hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quite right




then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil

until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be

of no use to them




you ask a question i said to which a reply can only be given in a parable




yes socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all

accustomed i suppose




i perceive i said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into such a

hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then you will be still more

amused at the meagreness of my imagination for the manner in which the best

men are treated in their own states is so grievous that no single thing on

earth is comparable to it and therefore if i am to plead their cause i must

have recourse to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things

like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures

imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and

stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf and has a similar

infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better the

sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steeringevery one is

of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of

navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further

assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one

who says the contrary they throng about the captain begging and praying him

to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail but others

are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them overboard and having

first chained up the noble captains senses with drink or some narcotic

drug they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the

stores thus eating and drinking they proceed on their voyage in such manner

as might be expected of them him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them

in their plot for getting the ship out of the captains hands into their

own whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor

pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call a

goodfornothing but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and

seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art if

he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship and that he must

and will be the steerer whether other people like or notthe possibility

of this union of authority with the steerers art has never seriously

entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling now in vessels

which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the

true pilot be regarded will he not be called by them a prater a stargazer a

goodfornothing




of course said adeimantus




then you will hardly need i said to hear the interpretation of the figure

which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the state for you

understand already




certainly




then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised at

finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain it to him and

try to convince him that their having honour would be far more extraordinary




i will




say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to

the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribute their

uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves

the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by himthat

is not the order of nature neither are the wise to go to the doors of

the richthe ingenious author of this saying told a liebut

the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the

physician he must go and he who wants to be governed to him who is able to

govern the ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be

ruled by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different

stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the true

helmsmen to those who are called by them goodfornothings and stargazers




precisely so he said




for these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest pursuit of

all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite faction not

that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by her opponents but

by her own professing followers the same of whom you suppose the accuser to

say that the greater number of them are arrant rogues and the best are

useless in which opinion i agreed




yes




and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained




true




then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also

unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any

more than the other




by all means




and let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description of the

gentle and noble nature truth as you will remember was his leader whom he

followed always and in all things failing in this he was an impostor and had

no part or lot in true philosophy




yes that was said




well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at variance

with present notions of him




certainly he said




and have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover of knowledge

is always striving after beingthat is his nature he will not rest in

the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only but will go

onthe keen edge will not be blunted nor the force of his desire abate

until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a

sympathetic and kindred power in the soul and by that power drawing near and

mingling and becoming incorporate with very being having begotten mind and

truth he will have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not

till then will he cease from his travail




nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him




and will the love of a lie be any part of a philosophers nature will he

not utterly hate a lie




he will




and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he

leads




impossible




justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance will follow

after




true he replied




neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the

philosophers virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage

magnificence apprehension memory were his natural gifts and you objected

that although no one could deny what i then said still if you leave words

and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of them

manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved we were then led

to enquire into the grounds of these accusations and have now arrived at the

point of asking why are the majority bad which question of necessity brought

us back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher




exactly




and we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature why so

many are spoiled and so few escape spoilingi am speaking of those who

were said to be useless but not wickedand when we have done with them

we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner of men are they who

aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are unworthy

and then by their manifold inconsistencies bring upon philosophy and upon

all philosophers that universal reprobation of which we speak




what are these corruptions he said




i will see if i can explain them to you every one will admit that a nature

having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a philosopher is a

rare plant which is seldom seen among men




rare indeed




and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures




what causes




in the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance and

the rest of them every one of which praiseworthy qualities and this is a most

singular circumstance destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is

the possessor of them




that is very singular he replied




then there are all the ordinary goods of lifebeauty wealth strength

rank and great connections in the stateyou understand the sort of

thingsthese also have a corrupting and distracting effect




i understand but i should like to know more precisely what you mean about

them




grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right way you will then have no

difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and they will no longer

appear strange to you




and how am i to do so he asked




why i said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or animal when

they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil in proportion to

their vigour are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable environment

for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than to what is not




very true




there is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien

conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast is

greater




certainly




and may we not say adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they are

illeducated become preeminently bad do not great crimes and the spirit of

pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than

from any inferiority whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very

great good or very great evil




there i think that you are right




and our philosopher follows the same analogyhe is like a plant which

having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue but

if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious of all weeds

unless he be preserved by some divine power do you really think as people so

often say that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private teachers

of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of are not the public who

say these things the greatest of all sophists and do they not educate to

perfection young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own

hearts




when is this accomplished he said




when they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or in a court

of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular resort and there is a

great uproar and they praise some things which are being said or done and

blame other things equally exaggerating both shouting and clapping their

hands and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled

redoubles the sound of the praise or blameat such a time will not a

young mans heart as they say leap within him will any private

training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular

opinion or will he be carried away by the stream will he not have the notions

of good and evil which the public in general havehe will do as they do

and as they are such will he be




yes socrates necessity will compel him




and yet i said there is a still greater necessity which has not been

mentioned




what is that




the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you are

aware these new sophists and educators who are the public apply when their

words are powerless




indeed they do and in right good earnest




now what opinion of any other sophist or of any private person can be

expected to overcome in such an unequal contest




none he replied




no indeed i said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly there

neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different type of

character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is supplied

by public opinioni speak my friend of human virtue only what is more

than human as the proverb says is not included for i would not have you

ignorant that in the present evil state of governments whatever is saved and

comes to good is saved by the power of god as we may truly say




i quite assent he replied




then let me crave your assent also to a further observation




what are you going to say




why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call sophists and whom

they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing but the opinion

of the many that is to say the opinions of their assemblies and this is

their wisdom i might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and

desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by himhe would learn how to

approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is

dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by

what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may

suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become

perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or

art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he

means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this

honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in

accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute good he pronounces

to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes

and he can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the

necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining to

others the nature of either or the difference between them which is immense

by heaven would not such an one be a rare educator




indeed he would




and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the

tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting or music or

finally in politics differ from him whom i have been describing for when a

man consorts with the many and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art

or the service which he has done the state making them his judges when he is

not obliged the socalled necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce

whatever they praise and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give

in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good did you

ever hear any of them which were not




no nor am i likely to hear




you recognise the truth of what i have been saying then let me ask you to

consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the

existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the

absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind




certainly not




then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher




impossible




and therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world




they must




and of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them




that is evident




then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his

calling to the end and remember what we were saying of him that he was to

have quickness and memory and courage and magnificencethese were

admitted by us to be the true philosophers gifts




yes




will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all

especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones




certainly he said




and his friends and fellowcitizens will want to use him as he gets older for

their own purposes




no question




falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour and

flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the power which he

will one day possess




that often happens he said




and what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such circumstances

especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and a tall

proper youth will he not be full of boundless aspirations and fancy himself

able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians and having got such

notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of

vain pomp and senseless pride




to be sure he will




now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to him and

tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which can only be got

by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse circumstances he will

be easily induced to listen




far otherwise




and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural

reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken

captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they think that they

are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his

companionship will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding

to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless using to this end

private intrigues as well as public prosecutions




there can be no doubt of it




and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher




impossible




then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man

a philosopher may if he be illeducated divert him from philosophy no less

than riches and their accompaniments and the other socalled goods of life




we were quite right




thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure which i

have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of all pursuits

they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time this being the class

out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest evil to states

and individuals and also of the greatest good when the tide carries them in

that direction but a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to

individuals or to states




that is most true he said




and so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete for her

own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are leading a false and

unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing that she has no kinsmen to be

her protectors enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproaches

which as you say her reprovers utter who affirm of her votaries that some

are good for nothing and that the greater number deserve the severest

punishment




that is certainly what people say




yes and what else would you expect i said when you think of the puny

creatures who seeing this land open to thema land well stocked with

fair names and showy titleslike prisoners running out of prison into a

sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy those who do so

being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts for although

philosophy be in this evil case still there remains a dignity about her which

is not to be found in the arts and many are thus attracted by her whose

natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their

meannesses as their bodies are by their trades and crafts is not this

unavoidable




yes




are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance

and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a new coat and is decked

out as a bridegroom going to marry his masters daughter who is left

poor and desolate




a most exact parallel




what will be the issue of such marriages will they not be vile and bastard




there can be no question of it




and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an

alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions

are likely to be generated will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear

having nothing in them genuine or worthy of or akin to true wisdom




no doubt he said




then adeimantus i said the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a

small remnant perchance some noble and welleducated person detained by exile

in her service who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to

her or some lofty soul born in a mean city the politics of which he contemns

and neglects and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts which they

justly despise and come to heror peradventure there are some who are

restrained by our friend theages bridle for everything in the life of

theages conspired to divert him from philosophy but illhealth kept him away

from politics my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning for

rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man those who

belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession

philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude and

they know that no politician is honest nor is there any champion of justice at

whose side they may fight and be saved such an one may be compared to a man

who has fallen among wild beastshe will not join in the wickedness of

his fellows but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures

and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the state or to his friends

and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good

either to himself or others he holds his peace and goes his own way he is

like one who in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries

along retires under the shelter of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full

of wickedness he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from

evil or unrighteousness and depart in peace and goodwill with bright hopes




yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs




a great workyes but not the greatest unless he find a state suitable

to him for in a state which is suitable to him he will have a larger growth

and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself




the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently

explained the injustice of the charges against her has been shownis

there anything more which you wish to say




nothing more on that subject he replied but i should like to know which of

the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her




not any of them i said and that is precisely the accusation which i bring

against themnot one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature and

hence that nature is warped and estrangedas the exotic seed which is

sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is wont to be overpowered and

to lose itself in the new soil even so this growth of philosophy instead of

persisting degenerates and receives another character but if philosophy ever

finds in the state that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that

she is in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men or

institutions are but humanand now i know that you are going to ask

what that state is




no he said there you are wrong for i was going to ask another

questionwhether it is the state of which we are the founders and

inventors or some other




yes i replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying before

that some living authority would always be required in the state having the

same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were

laying down the laws




that was said he replied




yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing

objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and

difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy




what is there remaining




the question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the

ruin of the state all great attempts are attended with risk hard is

the good as men say




still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will then be

complete




i shall not be hindered i said by any want of will but if at all by a want

of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please to remark in what i am

about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare that states should pursue

philosophy not as they do now but in a different spirit




in what manner




at present i said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning when

they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved from

moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those of them who are

reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when they come within sight of

the great difficulty of the subject i mean dialectic take themselves off in

after life when invited by some one else they may perhaps go and hear a

lecture and about this they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by

them to be their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases

they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus sun inasmuch as they

never light up again heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every

evening and relighted every morning




but what ought to be their course




just the opposite in childhood and youth their study and what philosophy they

learn should be suited to their tender years during this period while they

are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care should be given to

their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy as

life advances and the intellect begins to mature let them increase the

gymnastics of the soul but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past

civil and military duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious

labour as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with a

similar happiness in another




how truly in earnest you are socrates he said i am sure of that and yet

most of your hearers if i am not mistaken are likely to be still more earnest

in their opposition to you and will never be convinced thrasymachus least of

all




do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachus and me who have recently

become friends although indeed we were never enemies for i shall go on

striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do

something which may profit them against the day when they live again and hold

the like discourse in another state of existence




you are speaking of a time which is not very near




rather i replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with eternity

nevertheless i do not wonder that the many refuse to believe for they have

never seen that of which we are now speaking realized they have seen only a

conventional imitation of philosophy consisting of words artificially brought

together not like these of ours having a natural unity but a human being who

in word and work is perfectly moulded as far as he can be into the proportion

and likeness of virtuesuch a man ruling in a city which bears the same

image they have never yet seen neither one nor many of themdo you

think that they ever did




no indeed




no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble sentiments

such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in their power

seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge while they look coldly on the

subtleties of controversy of which the end is opinion and strife whether they

meet with them in the courts of law or in society




they are strangers he said to the words of which you speak




and this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced us to

admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities nor states nor

individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers

whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled whether

they will or not to take care of the state and until a like necessity be laid

on the state to obey them or until kings or if not kings the sons of kings

or princes are divinely inspired with a true love of true philosophy that

either or both of these alternatives are impossible i see no reason to affirm

if they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and

visionaries am i not right




quite right




if then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour in some

foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected philosopher

is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power to have the

charge of the state we are ready to assert to the death that this our

constitution has been and isyea and will be whenever the muse of

philosophy is queen there is no impossibility in all this that there is a

difficulty we acknowledge ourselves




my opinion agrees with yours he said




but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude




i should imagine not he replied




o my friend i said do not attack the multitude they will change their minds

if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with the view of soothing them

and removing their dislike of overeducation you show them your philosophers

as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their character and

profession and then mankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not

such as they supposedif they view him in this new light they will

surely change their notion of him and answer in another strain who can be at

enmity with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from envy

will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy nay let me answer for

you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of

mankind




i quite agree with you he said




and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feeling which the many

entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who rush in

uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault with them who make

persons instead of things the theme of their conversation and nothing can be

more unbecoming in philosophers than this




it is most unbecoming




for he adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely no time to

look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with malice and envy

contending against men his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and

immutable which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another but all

in order moving according to reason these he imitates and to these he will

as far as he can conform himself can a man help imitating that with which he

holds reverential converse




impossible




and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes orderly and

divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every one else he will

suffer from detraction




of course




and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself but human

nature generally whether in states or individuals into that which he beholds

elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful artificer of justice

temperance and every civil virtue




anything but unskilful




and if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth will

they be angry with philosophy will they disbelieve us when we tell them that

no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly

pattern




they will not be angry if they understand he said but how will they draw out

the plan of which you are speaking




they will begin by taking the state and the manners of men from which as from

a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean surface this is no

easy task but whether easy or not herein will lie the difference between them

and every other legislatorthey will have nothing to do either with

individual or state and will inscribe no laws until they have either found

or themselves made a clean surface




they will be very right he said




having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the

constitution




no doubt




and when they are filling in the work as i conceive they will often turn

their eyes upwards and downwards i mean that they will first look at absolute

justice and beauty and temperance and again at the human copy and will mingle

and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man and this they

will conceive according to that other image which when existing among men

homer calls the form and likeness of god




very true he said




and one feature they will erase and another they will put in until they have

made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of god




indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture




and now i said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as

rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions is such an

one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant because to his

hands we committed the state and are they growing a little calmer at what they

have just heard




much calmer if there is any sense in them




why where can they still find any ground for objection will they doubt that

the philosopher is a lover of truth and being




they would not be so unreasonable




or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the highest

good




neither can they doubt this




but again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable

circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was or will

they prefer those whom we have rejected




surely not




then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers bear

rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil nor will this our

imaginary state ever be realized




i think that they will be less angry




shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle and that

they have been converted and for very shame if for no other reason cannot

refuse to come to terms




by all means he said




then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected will any one

deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by

nature philosophers




surely no man he said




and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity

be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us but that

in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escapewho will

venture to affirm this




who indeed




but said i one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his

will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world

is so incredulous




yes one is enough




the ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing

and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them




certainly




and that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or

impossibility




i think not




but we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this if only

possible is assuredly for the best




we have




and now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would be for

the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult is not

impossible




very good




and so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject but more

remains to be discussedhow and by what studies and pursuits will the

saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages are they to apply

themselves to their several studies




certainly




i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and the

procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because i knew that

the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of attainment

but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me for i had to

discuss them all the same the women and children are now disposed of but the

other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very beginning we

were saying as you will remember that they were to be lovers of their

country tried by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships

nor in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their

patriotismhe was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth

pure like gold tried in the refiners fire was to be made a ruler and

to receive honours and rewards in life and after death this was the sort of

thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside and veiled her

face not liking to stir the question which has now arisen




i perfectly remember he said




yes my friend i said and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word but now

let me dare to saythat the perfect guardian must be a philosopher




yes he said let that be affirmed




and do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts which were

deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they are mostly found in

shreds and patches




what do you mean he said




you are aware i replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity

cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and that persons

who possess them and are at the same time highspirited and magnanimous are not

so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and settled

manner they are driven any way by their impulses and all solid principle goes

out of them




very true he said




on the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended upon

which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are equally immovable

when there is anything to be learned they are always in a torpid state and

are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual toil




quite true




and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom the

higher education is to be imparted and who are to share in any office or

command




certainly he said




and will they be a class which is rarely found




yes indeed




then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and

pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind of probation

which we did not mentionhe must be exercised also in many kinds of

knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all

or will faint under them as in any other studies and exercises




yes he said you are quite right in testing him but what do you mean by the

highest of all knowledge




you may remember i said that we divided the soul into three parts and

distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage and wisdom




indeed he said if i had forgotten i should not deserve to hear more




and do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them




to what do you refer




we were saying if i am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them in their

perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way at the end of which

they would appear but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a

level with the discussion which had preceded and you replied that such an

exposition would be enough for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to

me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it

is for you to say




yes he said i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair measure

of truth




but my friend i said a measure of such things which in any degree falls

short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the

measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think

that they need search no further




not an uncommon case when people are indolent




yes i said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the state and

of the laws




true




the guardian then i said must be required to take the longer circuit and

toil at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach the highest

knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is his proper calling




what he said is there a knowledge still higher than thishigher than

justice and the other virtues




yes i said there is and of the virtues too we must behold not the outline

merely as at presentnothing short of the most finished picture should

satisfy us when little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in

order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness how

ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the

highest accuracy




a right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you

what is this highest knowledge




nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer

many times and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you

are disposed to be troublesome for you have often been told that the idea of

good is the highest knowledge and that all other things become useful and

advantageous only by their use of this you can hardly be ignorant that of this

i was about to speak concerning which as you have often heard me say we know

so little and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind

will profit us nothing do you think that the possession of all other things is

of any value if we do not possess the good or the knowledge of all other

things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness




assuredly not




you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the

finer sort of wits say it is knowledge




yes




and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by

knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good




how ridiculous




yes i said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance of the

good and then presume our knowledge of itfor the good they define to be

knowledge of the good just as if we understood them when they use the term

goodthis is of course ridiculous




most true he said




and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for they are

compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good




certainly




and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same




true




there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this question is

involved




there can be none




further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be

what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with

the appearance of goodthe reality is what they seek in the case of the

good appearance is despised by every one




very true he said




of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his

actions having a presentiment that there is such an end and yet hesitating

because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of

other things and therefore losing whatever good there is in other

thingsof a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in

our state to whom everything is entrusted to be in the darkness of ignorance




certainly not he said




i am sure i said that he who does not know how the beautiful and the just are

likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and i suspect that no one

who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them




that he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours




and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be

perfectly ordered




of course he replied but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceive

this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure or different

from either




aye i said i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be

contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters




true socrates but i must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime in

the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions of others

and never telling his own




well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know




not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no right to do

that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion




and do you not know i said that all mere opinions are bad and the best of

them blind you would not deny that those who have any true notion without

intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road




very true




and do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when others will

tell you of brightness and beauty




still i must implore you socrates said glaucon not to turn away just as you

are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation of the good as

you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues we

shall be satisfied




yes my friend and i shall be at least equally satisfied but i cannot help

fearing that i shall fail and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicule upon

me no sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is the actual nature of the

good for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort too great for

me but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i

could be sure that you wished to hearotherwise not




by all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our

debt for the account of the parent




i do indeed wish i replied that i could pay and you receive the account of

the parent and not as now of the offspring only take however this latter

by way of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a

false account although i have no intention of deceiving you




yes we will take all the care that we can proceed




yes i said but i must first come to an understanding with you and remind you

of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion and at many other

times




what




the old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and so of other

things which we describe and define to all of them the term many

is applied




true he said




and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other things to

which the term many is applied there is an absolute for they may

be brought under a single idea which is called the essence of each




very true




the many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known but not

seen




exactly




and what is the organ with which we see the visible things




the sight he said




and with the hearing i said we hear and with the other senses perceive the

other objects of sense




true




but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of

workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived




no i never have he said




then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in

order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard




nothing of the sort




no indeed i replied and the same is true of most if not all the other

sensesyou would not say that any of them requires such an addition




certainly not




but you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing

or being seen




how do you mean




sight being as i conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting to see

colour being also present in them still unless there be a third nature

specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes will see nothing and

the colours will be invisible




of what nature are you speaking




of that which you term light i replied




true he said




noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility and great

beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for light is their bond

and light is no ignoble thing




nay he said the reverse of ignoble




and which i said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this

element whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the

visible to appear




you mean the sun as you and all mankind say




may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows




how




neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun




no




yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun




by far the most like




and the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed

from the sun




exactly




then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised by sight




true he said




and this is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in his

own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight and the things

of sight what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to mind and

the things of mind




will you be a little more explicit he said




why you know i said that the eyes when a person directs them towards

objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon and stars

only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have no clearness of vision

in them




very true




but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines they see

clearly and there is sight in them




certainly




and the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth and being

shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence

but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing then she has

opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of one opinion and then of

another and seems to have no intelligence




just so




now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the

knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and this you will deem

to be the cause of science and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the

subject of knowledge beautiful too as are both truth and knowledge you will

be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either and as

in the previous instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun

and yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth may be

deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has a place of honour

yet higher




what a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author of science

and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely cannot mean to say

that pleasure is the good




god forbid i replied but may i ask you to consider the image in another point

of view




in what point of view




you would say would you not that the sun is not only the author of visibility

in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth though he

himself is not generation




certainly




in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to

all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good is not

essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power




glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness by the light of heaven how

amazing




yes i said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you made me utter

my fancies




and pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there is anything

more to be said about the similitude of the sun




yes i said there is a great deal more




then omit nothing however slight




i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be

omitted




i hope not he said




you have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that one of

them is set over the intellectual world the other over the visible i do not

say heaven lest you should fancy that i am playing upon the name

ourhanoz orhatoz may i suppose that you have this distinction

of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind




i have




now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide each of

them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main divisions to

answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible and then compare

the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness and you

will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of

images and by images i mean in the first place shadows and in the second

place reflections in water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the

like do you understand




yes i understand




imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance to

include the animals which we see and everything that grows or is made




very good




would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different

degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion

is to the sphere of knowledge




most undoubtedly




next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual is

to be divided




in what manner




thusthere are two subdivisions in the lower of which the soul uses the

figures given by the former division as images the enquiry can only be

hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other

end in the higher of the two the soul passes out of hypotheses and goes up

to a principle which is above hypotheses making no use of images as in the

former case but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves




i do not quite understand your meaning he said




then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some

preliminary remarks you are aware that students of geometry arithmetic and

the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three

kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science these are

their hypotheses which they and every body are supposed to know and therefore

they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others

but they begin with them and go on until they arrive at last and in a

consistent manner at their conclusion




yes he said i know




and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and

reason about them they are thinking not of these but of the ideals which they

resemble not of the figures which they draw but of the absolute square and

the absolute diameter and so onthe forms which they draw or make and

which have shadows and reflections in water of their own are converted by them

into images but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves which

can only be seen with the eye of the mind




that is true




and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible although in the search after it

the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to a first principle

because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis but employing the

objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their turn as images

they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a greater

distinctness and therefore a higher value




i understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry and

the sister arts




and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible you will understand

me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the

power of dialectic using the hypotheses not as first principles but only as

hypothesesthat is to say as steps and points of departure into a world

which is above hypotheses in order that she may soar beyond them to the first

principle of the whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on

this by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible

object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends




i understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to be

describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate i understand

you to say that knowledge and being which the science of dialectic

contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts as they are termed

which proceed from hypotheses only these are also contemplated by the

understanding and not by the senses yet because they start from hypotheses

and do not ascend to a principle those who contemplate them appear to you not

to exercise the higher reason upon them although when a first principle is

added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason and the habit which is

concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term

understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion and reason




you have quite conceived my meaning i said and now corresponding to these

four divisions let there be four faculties in the soulreason answering

to the highest understanding to the second faith or conviction to the

third and perception of shadows to the lastand let there be a scale of

them and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same

degree that their objects have truth




i understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement




 book vii


and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or

unenlightenedbehold human beings living in a underground den which

has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they

have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that

they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains

from turning round their heads above and behind them a fire is blazing at a

distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you

will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which

marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets




i see




and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of

vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various

materials which appear over the wall some of them are talking others silent




you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners




like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows

of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave




true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never

allowed to move their heads




and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see

the shadows




yes he said




and if they were able to converse with one another would they not suppose that

they were naming what was actually before them




very true




and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side

would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passersby spoke that the voice

which they heard came from the passing shadow




no question he replied




to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the

images




that is certain




and now look again and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are

released and disabused of their error at first when any of them is liberated

and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look

towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and

he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen

the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before

was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his

eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer visionwhat

will be his reply and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing

to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name themwill he not

be perplexed will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are

truer than the objects which are now shown to him




far truer




and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain

in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of

vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer

than the things which are now being shown to him




true he said




and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged

ascent and held fast until he is forced into the presence of the sun himself

is he not likely to be pained and irritated when he approaches the light his

eyes will be dazzled and he will not be able to see anything at all of what

are now called realities




not all in a moment he said




he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world and first

he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men and other objects in

the water and then the objects themselves then he will gaze upon the light of

the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven and he will see the sky and the

stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day




certainly




last of all he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of him in

the water but he will see him in his own proper place and not in another and

he will contemplate him as he is




certainly




he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the

years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in a

certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been

accustomed to behold




clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him




and when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his

fellowprisoners do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the

change and pity them




certainly he would




and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those

who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them

went before and which followed after and which were together and who were

therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future do you think that he

would care for such honours and glories or envy the possessors of them would

he not say with homer




better to be the poor servant of a poor master




and to endure anything rather than think as they do and live after their

manner




yes he said i think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these

false notions and live in this miserable manner




imagine once more i said such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be

replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes full of

darkness




to be sure he said




and if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the shadows

with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while his sight was

still weak and before his eyes had become steady and the time which would be

needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable would he

not be ridiculous men would say of him that up he went and down he came

without his eyes and that it was better not even to think of ascending and if

any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only

catch the offender and they would put him to death




no question he said




this entire allegory i said you may now append dear glaucon to the previous

argument the prisonhouse is the world of sight the light of the fire is the

sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to

be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor

belief which at your desire i have expressedwhether rightly or

wrongly god knows but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world

of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an

effort and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all

things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light in this

visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth in the

intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally

either in public or private life must have his eye fixed




i agree he said as far as i am able to understand you




moreover i said you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific

vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their souls are ever

hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell which desire of

theirs is very natural if our allegory may be trusted




yes very natural




and is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations

to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner if while

his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding

darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of law or in other places about

the images or the shadows of images of justice and is endeavouring to meet the

conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice




anything but surprising he replied




any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes

are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the

light or from going into the light which is true of the minds eye

quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees any

one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will

first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life and is

unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness

to the day is dazzled by excess of light and he will count the one happy in

his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have a

mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be

more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above

out of the light into the den




that he said is a very just distinction




but then if i am right certain professors of education must be wrong when

they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there

before like sight into blind eyes




they undoubtedly say this he replied




whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in

the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to

light without the whole body so too the instrument of knowledge can only by

the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that

of being and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being and of the

brightest and best of being or in other words of the good




very true




and must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and

quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight for that exists already

but has been turned in the wrong direction and is looking away from the truth




yes he said such an art may be presumed




and whereas the other socalled virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily

qualities for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted

later by habit and exercise the virtue of wisdom more than anything else

contains a divine element which always remains and by this conversion is

rendered useful and profitable or on the other hand hurtful and useless did

you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a

clever roguehow eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to

his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen eyesight is forced into the

service of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness




very true he said




but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their

youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures such as eating

and drinking which like leaden weights were attached to them at their birth

and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things

that are belowif i say they had been released from these impediments

and turned in the opposite direction the very same faculty in them would have

seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now




very likely




yes i said and there is another thing which is likely or rather a necessary

inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of

the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able

ministers of state not the former because they have no single aim of duty

which is the rule of all their actions private as well as public nor the

latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that

they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest




very true he replied




then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to

compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to

be the greatest of allthey must continue to ascend until they arrive at

the good but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to

do as they do now




what do you mean




i mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they

must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of

their labours and honours whether they are worth having or not




but is not this unjust he said ought we to give them a worse life when they

might have a better




you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator

who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the

happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by

persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of the state and therefore

benefactors of one another to this end he created them not to please

themselves but to be his instruments in binding up the state




true he said i had forgotten




observe glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our

philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain to them

that in other states men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils

of politics and this is reasonable for they grow up at their own sweet will

and the government would rather not have them being selftaught they cannot

be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received

but we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of

yourselves and of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more

perfectly than they have been educated and you are better able to share in the

double duty wherefore each of you when his turn comes must go down to the

general underground abode and get the habit of seeing in the dark when you

have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand times better than the

inhabitants of the den and you will know what the several images are and what

they represent because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their

truth and thus our state which is also yours will be a reality and not a

dream only and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states

in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in

the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good whereas the truth

is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always

the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager

the worst




quite true he replied




and will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn at the

toils of state when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time

with one another in the heavenly light




impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which we

impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one of them will

take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion of our present

rulers of state




yes my friend i said and there lies the point you must contrive for your

future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler and then you may

have a wellordered state for only in the state which offers this will they

rule who are truly rich not in silver and gold but in virtue and wisdom

which are the true blessings of life whereas if they go to the administration

of public affairs poor and hungering after their own private advantage

thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never

be for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic broils

which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole

state




most true he replied




and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that

of true philosophy do you know of any other




indeed i do not he said




and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task for if they are

there will be rival lovers and they will fight




no question




who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians surely they will be

the men who are wisest about affairs of state and by whom the state is best

administered and who at the same time have other honours and another and a

better life than that of politics




they are the men and i will choose them he replied




and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced and how

they are to be brought from darkness to lightas some are said to have

ascended from the world below to the gods




by all means he replied




the process i said is not the turning over of an oystershell in allusion to

a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an oystershell which

was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light side uppermost but the

turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to

the true day of being that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be

true philosophy




quite so




and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting

such a change




certainly




what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to

being and another consideration has just occurred to me you will remember

that our young men are to be warrior athletes




yes that was said




then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality




what quality




usefulness in war




yes if possible




there were two parts in our former scheme of education were there not




just so




there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body and

may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption




true




then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover




no




but what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent into our

former scheme




music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic and

trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making them

harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science and the words

whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony

in them but in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are

now seeking




you are most accurate i said in your recollection in music there certainly

was nothing of the kind but what branch of knowledge is there my dear

glaucon which is of the desired nature since all the useful arts were

reckoned mean by us




undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the arts are also

excluded what remains




well i said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and then we

shall have to take something which is not special but of universal

application




what may that be




a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common and

which every one first has to learn among the elements of education




what is that




the little matter of distinguishing one two and threein a word number

and calculationdo not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of

them




yes




then the art of war partakes of them




to be sure




then palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves agamemnon ridiculously

unfit to be a general did you never remark how he declares that he had

invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the

army at troy which implies that they had never been numbered before and

agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own

feethow could he if he was ignorant of number and if that is true what

sort of general must he have been




i should say a very strange one if this was as you say




can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic




certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of military

tactics or indeed i should rather say if he is to be a man at all




i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of this

study




what is your notion




it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and which

leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly used for the

true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being




will you explain your meaning he said




i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiry with me and say

yes or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own

mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that we

may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as i suspect one of them




explain he said




i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not

invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the

case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is

imperatively demanded




you are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses are

imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade




no i said that is not at all my meaning




then what is your meaning




when speaking of uninviting objects i mean those which do not pass from one

sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which do in this latter

case the sense coming upon the object whether at a distance or near gives no

more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite an illustration

will make my meaning clearerhere are three fingersa little

finger a second finger and a middle finger




very good




you may suppose that they are seen quite close and here comes the point




what is it




each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle or at the

extremity whether white or black or thick or thinit makes no

difference a finger is a finger all the same in these cases a man is not

compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger for the sight never

intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger




true




and therefore i said as we might expect there is nothing here which invites

or excites intelligence




there is not he said




but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers can

sight adequately perceive them and is no difference made by the circumstance

that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity and in

like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or

thinness of softness or hardness and so of the other senses do they give

perfect intimations of such matters is not their mode of operation on this

wisethe sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is

necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness and only intimates to

the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft




you are quite right he said




and must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of

a hard which is also soft what again is the meaning of light and heavy if

that which is light is also heavy and that which is heavy light




yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and

require to be explained




yes i said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid

calculation and intelligence that she may see whether the several objects

announced to her are one or two




true




and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different




certainly




and if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as in a state

of division for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as

one




true




the eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused manner

they were not distinguished




yes




whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled to

reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and not confused




very true




was not this the beginning of the enquiry what is great and

what is small




exactly so




and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible




most true




this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the intellect

or the reversethose which are simultaneous with opposite impressions

invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not




i understand he said and agree with you




and to which class do unity and number belong




i do not know he replied




think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer

for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other

sense then as we were saying in the case of the finger there would be

nothing to attract towards being but when there is some contradiction always

present and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of

plurality then thought begins to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed

and wanting to arrive at a decision asks what is absolute unity

this is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and

converting the mind to the contemplation of true being




and surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we see the

same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude




yes i said and this being true of one must be equally true of all number




certainly




and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number




yes




and they appear to lead the mind towards truth




yes in a very remarkable manner




then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having a double

use military and philosophical for the man of war must learn the art of

number or he will not know how to array his troops and the philosopher also

because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being and

therefore he must be an arithmetician




that is true




and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher




certainly




then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe and we

must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men of our state

to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs but they must carry on the study

until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only nor again like

merchants or retailtraders with a view to buying or selling but for the sake

of their military use and of the soul herself and because this will be the

easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being




that is excellent he said




yes i said and now having spoken of it i must add how charming the science

is and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end if pursued in the

spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper




how do you mean




i mean as i was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect

compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling against the

introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument you know how

steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to

divide absolute unity when he is calculating and if you divide they multiply

meaning either  that they integrate the number because they deny the

possibility of fractions or  that division is regarded by them as a process

of multiplication for the fractions of one continue to be units taking care

that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions




that is very true




now suppose a person were to say to them o my friends what are these

wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as you say there is

a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal invariable

indivisiblewhat would they answer




they would answer as i should conceive that they were speaking of those

numbers which can only be realized in thought




then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating

as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure

truth




yes that is a marked characteristic of it




and have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for

calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the

dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no

other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise

have been




very true he said




and indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not many as

difficult




you will not




and for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best

natures should be trained and which must not be given up




i agree




let this then be made one of our subjects of education and next shall we

enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us




you mean geometry




exactly so




clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to

war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or closing or extending

the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre whether in actual battle

or on a march it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a

geometrician




yes i said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or

calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the greater and more

advanced part of geometrywhether that tends in any degree to make more

easy the vision of the idea of good and thither as i was saying all things

tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place where is the

full perfection of being which she ought by all means to behold




true he said




then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming only it

does not concern us




yes that is what we assert




yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that

such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary

language of geometricians




how so




they have in view practice only and are always speaking in a narrow and

ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and the

likethey confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life

whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science




certainly he said




then must not a further admission be made




what admission




that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not

of aught perishing and transient




that he replied may be readily allowed and is true




then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth and create

the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to

fall down




nothing will be more likely to have such an effect




then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your

fair city should by all means learn geometry moreover the science has indirect

effects which are not small




of what kind he said




there are the military advantages of which you spoke i said and in all

departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who has studied

geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not




yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them




then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will

study




let us do so he replied




and suppose we make astronomy the thirdwhat do you say




i am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons and of

months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or

sailor




i am amused i said at your fear of the world which makes you guard against

the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and i quite admit the

difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which

when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these purified and reillumined

and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes for by it alone is

truth seen now there are two classes of persons one class of those who will

agree with you and will take your words as a revelation another class to whom

they will be utterly unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle

tales for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them and

therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing

to argue you will very likely say with neither and that your chief aim in

carrying on the argument is your own improvement at the same time you do not

grudge to others any benefit which they may receive




i think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf




then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences




what was the mistake he said




after plane geometry i said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution

instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension the

third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth ought to have

followed




that is true socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about these

subjects




why yes i said and for two reasonsin the first place no government

patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them and

they are difficult in the second place students cannot learn them unless they

have a director but then a director can hardly be found and even if he could

as matters now stand the students who are very conceited would not attend to

him that however would be otherwise if the whole state became the director

of these studies and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come

and there would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be

made since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of their

fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them

still these studies force their way by their natural charm and very likely if

they had the help of the state they would some day emerge into light




yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them but i do not clearly

understand the change in the order first you began with a geometry of plane

surfaces




yes i said




and you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward




yes and i have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid geometry

which in natural order should have followed made me pass over this branch

and go on to astronomy or motion of solids




true he said




then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if

encouraged by the state let us go on to astronomy which will be fourth




the right order he replied and now socrates as you rebuked the vulgar

manner in which i praised astronomy before my praise shall be given in your

own spirit for every one as i think must see that astronomy compels the soul

to look upwards and leads us from this world to another




every one but myself i said to every one else this may be clear but not to

me




and what then would you say




i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to

me to make us look downwards and not upwards




what do you mean he asked




you i replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge

of the things above and i dare say that if a person were to throw his head

back and study the fretted ceiling you would still think that his mind was the

percipient and not his eyes and you are very likely right and i may be a

simpleton but in my opinion that knowledge only which is of being and of the

unseen can make the soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens

or blinks on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense i would

deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science his soul

is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge is by water or

by land whether he floats or only lies on his back




i acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke still i should like to

ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that

knowledge of which we are speaking




i will tell you i said the starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a

visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most perfect of visible

things must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute

swiftness and absolute slowness which are relative to each other and carry

with them that which is contained in them in the true number and in every true

figure now these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by

sight




true he replied




the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher

knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently

wrought by the hand of daedalus or some other great artist which we may

chance to behold any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the

exquisiteness of their workmanship but he would never dream of thinking that

in them he could find the true equal or the true double or the truth of any

other proportion




no he replied such an idea would be ridiculous




and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the

movements of the stars will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven

are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect manner but he will never

imagine that the proportions of night and day or of both to the month or of

the month to the year or of the stars to these and to one another and any

other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to

no deviationthat would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so

much pains in investigating their exact truth




i quite agree though i never thought of this before




then i said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems and let

the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make

the natural gift of reason to be of any real use




that he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers




yes i said and there are many other things which must also have a similar

extension given to them if our legislation is to be of any value but can you

tell me of any other suitable study




no he said not without thinking




motion i said has many forms and not one only two of them are obvious

enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others as i imagine

which may be left to wiser persons




but where are the two




there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one already named




and what may that be




the second i said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is

to the eyes for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the

stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions and these are sister

sciencesas the pythagoreans say and we glaucon agree with them




yes he replied




but this i said is a laborious study and therefore we had better go and

learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any other applications

of these sciences at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher

object




what is that




there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which our pupils

ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i was saying that they did

in astronomy for in the science of harmony as you probably know the same

thing happens the teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which

are heard only and their labour like that of the astronomers is in vain




yes by heaven he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking

about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears close

alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their

neighbours wallone set of them declaring that they distinguish an

intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of

measurement the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the

sameeither party setting their ears before their understanding




you mean i said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack

them on the pegs of the instrument i might carry on the metaphor and speak

after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives and make accusations

against the strings both of backwardness and forwardness to sound but this

would be tedious and therefore i will only say that these are not the men and

that i am referring to the pythagoreans of whom i was just now proposing to

enquire about harmony for they too are in error like the astronomers they

investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain

to problemsthat is to say they never reach the natural harmonies of

number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not




that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge




a thing i replied which i would rather call useful that is if sought after

with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued in any other spirit

useless




very true he said




now when all these studies reach the point of intercommunion and connection

with one another and come to be considered in their mutual affinities then i

think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a value for our

objects otherwise there is no profit in them




i suspect so but you are speaking socrates of a vast work




what do you mean i said the prelude or what do you not know that all this is

but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn for you surely

would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician




assuredly not he said i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was

capable of reasoning




but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have

the knowledge which we require of them




neither can this be supposed




and so glaucon i said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic this

is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the faculty of sight

will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight as you may remember was

imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars and last of

all the sun himself and so with dialectic when a person starts on the

discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only and without any

assistance of sense and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at

the perception of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the

intellectual world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible




exactly he said




then this is the progress which you call dialectic




true




but the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation from the

shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from the underground den

to the sun while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and

plants and the light of the sun but are able to perceive even with their weak

eyes the images in the water which are divine and are the shadows of true

existence not shadows of images cast by a light of fire which compared with

the sun is only an imagethis power of elevating the highest principle

in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence with which

we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body

to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible

worldthis power is given as i was saying by all that study and pursuit

of the arts which has been described




i agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe yet

from another point of view is harder still to deny this however is not a

theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to be discussed again and

again and so whether our conclusion be true or false let us assume all this

and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain a play

upon the greek word which means both law and

strain and describe that in like manner say then what is

the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic and what are the paths

which lead thither for these paths will also lead to our final rest




dear glaucon i said you will not be able to follow me here though i would do

my best and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth

according to my notion whether what i told you would or would not have been a

reality i cannot venture to say but you would have seen something like

reality of that i am confident




doubtless he replied




but i must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this

and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences




of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last




and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending

by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is

in its own nature for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or

opinions of men or are cultivated with a view to production and construction

or for the preservation of such productions and constructions and as to the

mathematical sciences which as we were saying have some apprehension of true

beinggeometry and the likethey only dream about being but never

can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which

they use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them for when a man

knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and intermediate

steps are also constructed out of he knows not what how can he imagine that

such a fabric of convention can ever become science




impossible he said




then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle and

is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground

secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough

is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and she uses as handmaids and helpers in

the work of conversion the sciences which we have been discussing custom

terms them sciences but they ought to have some other name implying greater

clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our

previous sketch was called understanding but why should we dispute about

names when we have realities of such importance to consider




why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought of the

mind with clearness




at any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions two for

intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division science the

second understanding the third belief and the fourth perception of shadows

opinion being concerned with becoming and intellect with being and so to make

a proportion




as being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion and as intellect is

to opinion so is science to belief and understanding to the perception of

shadows




but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of

opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than

this has been




as far as i understand he said i agree




and do you also agree i said in describing the dialectician as one who

attains a conception of the essence of each thing and he who does not possess

and is therefore unable to impart this conception in whatever degree he fails

may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence will you admit so

much




yes he said how can i deny it




and you would say the same of the conception of the good until the person is

able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good and unless he can run

the gauntlet of all objections and is ready to disprove them not by appeals

to opinion but to absolute truth never faltering at any step of the

argumentunless he can do all this you would say that he knows neither

the idea of good nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything

at all which is given by opinion and not by sciencedreaming and

slumbering in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world

below and has his final quietus




in all that i should most certainly agree with you




and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you are

nurturing and educatingif the ideal ever becomes a realityyou

would not allow the future rulers to be like posts literally

lines probably the startingpoint of a racecourse having no

reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters




certainly not




then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable

them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions




yes he said you and i together will make it




dialectic then as you will agree is the copingstone of the sciences and is

set over them no other science can be placed higherthe nature of

knowledge can no further go




i agree he said




but to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are to be

assigned are questions which remain to be considered




yes clearly




you remember i said how the rulers were chosen before




certainly he said




the same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given to the

surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and having noble and

generous tempers they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate

their education




and what are these




such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind more often

faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics the

toil is more entirely the minds own and is not shared with the body




very true he replied




further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an

unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be

able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the

intellectual discipline and study which we require of him




certainly he said he must have natural gifts




the mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no vocation

and this as i was before saying is the reason why she has fallen into

disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards




what do you mean




in the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting

industryi mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle

as for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all other

bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or

listening or enquiring or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of

an opposite kind and he may have the other sort of lameness




certainly he said




and as to truth i said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which

hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when

they tell lies but is patient of involuntary falsehood and does not mind

wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance and has no shame at

being detected




to be sure




and again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other

virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the

bastard for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and

individuals unconsciously err and the state makes a ruler and the individual

a friend of one who being defective in some part of virtue is in a figure

lame or a bastard




that is very true he said




all these things then will have to be carefully considered by us and if only

those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound

in body and mind justice herself will have nothing to say against us and we

shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the state but if our pupils

are men of another stamp the reverse will happen and we shall pour a still

greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present




that would not be creditable




certainly not i said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into earnest i am

equally ridiculous




in what respect




i had forgotten i said that we were not serious and spoke with too much

excitement for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of

men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her

disgrace and my anger made me too vehement




indeed i was listening and did not think so




but i who am the speaker felt that i was and now let me remind you that

although in our former selection we chose old men we must not do so in this

solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn

many thingsfor he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is

the time for any extraordinary toil




of course




and therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements of

instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented to the

mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing our system of

education




why not




because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of

any kind bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the body but

knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind




very true




then my good friend i said do not use compulsion but let early education be

a sort of amusement you will then be better able to find out the natural bent




that is a very rational notion he said




do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the battle on

horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up

and like young hounds have a taste of blood given them




yes i remember




the same practice may be followed i said in all these thingslabours

lessons dangersand he who is most at home in all of them ought to be

enrolled in a select number




at what age




at the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether of two or

three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other

purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning and the trial of

who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which

our youth are subjected




certainly he replied




after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will

be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they learned without any

order in their early education will now be brought together and they will be

able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being




yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root




yes i said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of

dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical




i agree with you he said




these i said are the points which you must consider and those who have most

of this comprehension and who are most steadfast in their learning and in

their military and other appointed duties when they have arrived at the age of

thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elevated to higher

honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to

learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses

and in company with truth to attain absolute being and here my friend great

caution is required




why great caution




do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialectic has

introduced




what evil he said




the students of the art are filled with lawlessness




quite true he said




do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their

case or will you make allowance for them




in what way make allowance




i want you i said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious son who is

brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous family and has

many flatterers when he grows up to manhood he learns that his alleged are

not his real parents but who the real are he is unable to discover can you

guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed

parents first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false

relation and then again when he knows or shall i guess for you




if you please




then i should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to

honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the

flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need or to do or

say anything against them and he will be less willing to disobey them in any

important matter




he will




but when he has made the discovery i should imagine that he would diminish his

honour and regard for them and would become more devoted to the flatterers

their influence over him would greatly increase he would now live after their

ways and openly associate with them and unless he were of an unusually good

disposition he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or

other relations




well all that is very probable but how is the image applicable to the

disciples of philosophy




in this way you know that there are certain principles about justice and

honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental authority

we have been brought up obeying and honouring them




that is true




there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract

the soul but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right and

they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers




true




now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks what is fair

or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught him and then

arguments many and diverse refute his words until he is driven into believing

that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable or just and good any

more than the reverse and so of all the notions which he most valued do you

think that he will still honour and obey them as before




impossible




and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore and he

fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any life other than

that which flatters his desires




he cannot




and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it




unquestionably




now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have

described and also as i was just now saying most excusable




yes he said and i may add pitiable




therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who

are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing them to

dialectic




certainly




there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early for

youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the taste in their

mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting and refuting others

in imitation of those who refute them like puppydogs they rejoice in pulling

and tearing at all who come near them




yes he said there is nothing which they like better




and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of

many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything

which they believed before and hence not only they but philosophy and all

that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world




too true he said




but when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of such

insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth and not

the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement and the greater

moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of

the pursuit




very true he said




and did we not make special provision for this when we said that the disciples

of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not as now any chance

aspirant or intruder




very true




suppose i said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to

be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of

years which were passed in bodily exercisewill that be enough




would you say six or four years he asked




say five years i replied at the end of the time they must be sent down again

into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men

are qualified to hold in this way they will get their experience of life and

there will be an opportunity of trying whether when they are drawn all manner

of ways by temptation they will stand firm or flinch




and how long is this stage of their lives to last




fifteen years i answered and when they have reached fifty years of age then

let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action

of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their

consummation the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the

soul to the universal light which lightens all things and behold the absolute

good for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the state

and the lives of individuals and the remainder of their own lives also making

philosophy their chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at

politics and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing

some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they have brought

up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be

governors of the state then they will depart to the islands of the blest and

dwell there and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and

honour them if the pythian oracle consent as demigods but if not as in any

case blessed and divine




you are a sculptor socrates and have made statues of our governors faultless

in beauty




yes i said glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not suppose that

what i have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their

natures can go




there you are right he said since we have made them to share in all things

like the men




well i said and you would agree would you not that what has been said

about the state and the government is not a mere dream and although difficult

not impossible but only possible in the way which has been supposed that is

to say when the true philosopher kings are born in a state one or more of

them despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and

worthless esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from

right and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things

whose ministers they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when

they set in order their own city




how will they proceed




they will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city

who are more than ten years old and will take possession of their children

who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents these they will train in

their own habits and laws i mean in the laws which we have given them and in

this way the state and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and

most easily attain happiness and the nation which has such a constitution will

gain most




yes that will be the best way and i think socrates that you have very well

described how if ever such a constitution might come into being




enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bears its

imagethere is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him




there is no difficulty he replied and i agree with you in thinking that

nothing more need be said




 book viii


and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state

wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits

of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the

bravest warriors are to be their kings




that replied glaucon has been acknowledged




yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when

appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as

we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or

individual and about their property you remember what we agreed




yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of

mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the

other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they

were to take care of themselves and of the whole state




true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find

the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path




there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had

finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and

that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had

more excellent things to relate both of state and man and you said further

that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false

forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that

their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were

worth examining when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to

who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the

best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable i asked you

what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus

and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way

to the point at which we have now arrived




your recollection i said is most exact




then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same

position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer

which you were about to give me then




yes if i can i will i said




i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you

were speaking




that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i

spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and

sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next

this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with

evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very

different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them

all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state i do not know do you of

any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character there

are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other

intermediate forms of government but these are nondescripts and may be found

equally among hellenes and among barbarians




yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which

exist among them




do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and

that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other for we cannot

suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the

human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw

other things after them




yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters




then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual

minds will also be five




certainly




him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have

already described




we have




then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the

contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the

oligarchical democratical and tyrannical let us place the most just by the

side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the

relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or

pure injustice the enquiry will then be completed and we shall know whether

we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with

the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice




certainly he replied we must do as you say




shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of

taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with

the government of honouri know of no name for such a government other

than timocracy or perhaps timarchy we will compare with this the like

character in the individual and after that consider oligarchy and the

oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and

the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and

once more take a look into the tyrants soul and try to arrive at a

satisfactory decision




that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable




first then i said let us enquire how timocracy the government of honour

arises out of aristocracy the government of the best clearly all political

changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government

which is united however small cannot be moved




very true he said




in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner will the two

classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one

another shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us

how discord first arose shall we imagine them in solemn mockery

to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty

tragic vein making believe to be in earnest




how would they address us




after this mannera city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken

but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a

constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be

dissolved and this is the dissolutionin plants that grow in the earth

as well as in animals that move on the earths surface fertility and

sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each

are completed which in shortlived existences pass over a short space and in

longlived ones over a long space but to the knowledge of human fecundity and

sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws

which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed

with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world

when they ought not now that which is of divine birth has a period which is

contained in a perfect number ie a cyclical number such as  which is

equal to the sum of its divisors    so that when the circle or time

represented by  is completed the lesser times or rotations represented by 

  are also completed but the period of human birth is comprehended in a

number in which first increments by involution and evolution or squared and

cubed obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and

waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another

probably the numbers     of which the three first  the sides of the

pythagorean triangle the terms will then be  cubed  cubed  cubed which

together   cubed   the base of these  with a third added  when

combined with five  and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies

the first a square which is a hundred times as great    x  or the

first a square which is  x    the whole number will then be

  a square of  and an oblong of  by  and the other a figure

having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred

numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square ie omitting fractions

the side of which is five  x    x    each of them being less by

one than the perfect square which includes the fractions sc  or less by

or consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational diameters

etc   for other explanations of the passage see introduction two

perfect squares of irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five

      and a hundred cubes of three  x        

 now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over

the good and evil of births for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of

births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be

goodly or fortunate and though only the best of them will be appointed by

their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers

places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to

fail in taking care of us the muses first by undervaluing music which

neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state

will be less cultivated in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed

who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races

which like hesiods are of gold and silver and brass and iron and so

iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will

arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all

places are causes of hatred and war this the muses affirm to be the stock from

which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us




yes and we may assume that they answer truly




why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely




and what do the muses say next




when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and

brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the

gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their

own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things there was

a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and

houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and

maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and

made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and

in keeping a watch against them




i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change




and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between

oligarchy and aristocracy




very true




such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they

proceed clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the

perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have

some peculiarities




true he said




in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from

agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common

meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military trainingin

all these respects this state will resemble the former




true




but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer

to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning

from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted

for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military

stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting warsthis

state will be for the most part peculiar




yes




yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who

live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and

silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries

of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are

just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their

wives or on any others whom they please




that is most true he said




and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money

which they prize they will spend that which is another mans on the

gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like

children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle

influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the

companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than

music




undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of

good and evil




why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is

predominantly seenthe spirit of contention and ambition and these are

due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element




assuredly he said




such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been

described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a

sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly

unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men

omitting none of them would be an interminable labour




very true he replied




now what man answers to this form of governmenthow did he come into being and

what is he like




i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises

him he is not unlike our friend glaucon




perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other

respects in which he is very different




in what respects




he should have more of selfassertion and be less cultivated and yet a friend

of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker such a person is

apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for

that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to

authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a

ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because

he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of

gymnastic exercises and of the chase




yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy




such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he

will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the

avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards virtue having lost

his best guardian




who was that said adeimantus




philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes up her abode in a

man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life




good he said




such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state




exactly




his origin is as followshe is often the young son of a brave father

who dwells in an illgoverned city of which he declines the honours and

offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to

waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble




and how does the son come into being




the character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother

complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the

consequence is that she has no precedence among other women further when she

sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and

railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly

and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he

treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her

son that his father is only half a man and far too easygoing adding all the

other complaints about her own illtreatment which women are so fond of

rehearsing




yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so

like themselves




and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be

attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to

the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging

him in any way and he fails to prosecute them they tell the youth that when

he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man

than his father he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort

of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons

and held in no esteem while the busybodies are honoured and applauded the

result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these

thingshearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of

his way of life and making comparisons of him and othersis drawn

opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational

principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and

appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad

company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and

gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of

contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious




you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly




then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of

character




we have




next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says




is set over against another state




or rather as our plan requires begin with the state




by all means




i believe that oligarchy follows next in order




and what manner of government do you term oligarchy




a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power

and the poor man is deprived of it




i understand he replied




ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy

arises




yes




well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the

other




how




the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the ruin of

timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their

wives care about the law




yes indeed




and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great

mass of the citizens become lovers of money




likely enough




and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune

the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together

in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls




true




and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and

the virtuous are dishonoured




clearly




and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected




that is obvious




and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of

trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of

him and dishonour the poor man




they do so




they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification

of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the

oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls

below the amount fixed to have any share in the government these changes in

the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already

done their work




very true




and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established




yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and

what are the defects of which we were speaking




first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification just think what

would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a

poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot




you mean that they would shipwreck




yes and is not this true of the government of anything




i should imagine so




except a cityor would you include a city




nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule

of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all




this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy




clearly




and here is another defect which is quite as bad




what defect




the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of

poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always

conspiring against one another




that surely is at least as bad




another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable

of carrying on any war either they arm the multitude and then they are more

afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour

of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule and

at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes




how discreditable




and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too

many callingsthey are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one does

that look well




anything but well




there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this

state first begins to be liable




what evil




a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after

the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being

neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor

helpless creature




yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state




the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the

extremes of great wealth and utter poverty




true




but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a

man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship

or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was

neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift




as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift




may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the

honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the

hive




just so socrates




and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of

the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful

stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers

of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed




most true he said




clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that

neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers of

temples and all sorts of malefactors




clearly




well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers




yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler




and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be

found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to

restrain by force




certainly we may be so bold




the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education

illtraining and an evil constitution of the state




true




such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be

many other evils




very likely




then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for

their wealth may now be dismissed let us next proceed to consider the nature

and origin of the individual who answers to this state




by all means




does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise




how




a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he

begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he

sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he

and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high

officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and

either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and

all his property taken from him




nothing more likely




and the son has seen and known all thishe is a ruined man and his fear

has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his

bosoms throne humbled by poverty he takes to moneymaking and by mean

and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together is not such an one

likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and

to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and

scimitar




most true he replied




and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on

either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels

the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and

will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich

men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and

the means of acquiring it




of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion

of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one




and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth




yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state

out of which oligarchy came




let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them




very good




first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth




certainly




also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his

necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he

subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable




true




he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse

for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud is he not a

true image of the state which he represents




he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as

by the state




you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said




i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind

god director of his chorus or given him chief honour




excellent i said yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this

want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper

and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life




true




do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries




where must i look




you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly

as in the guardianship of an orphan




aye




it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a

reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not

making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity

and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions




to be sure




yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the

drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not

his own




yes and they will be strong in him too




the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one

but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior

ones




true




for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet

the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never

come near him




i should expect so




and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for

any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend

his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive

appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true

oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the

result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money




very true




can we any longer doubt then that the miser and moneymaker answers to the

oligarchical state




there can be no doubt




next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered

by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring

him up for judgment




that he said is our method




well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise is

it not on this wisethe good at which such a state aims is to become as

rich as possible a desire which is insatiable




what then




the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to

curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by

their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus

increase their own wealth and importance




to be sure




there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation

cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent

one or the other will be disregarded




that is tolerably clear




and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and

extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary




yes often




and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully

armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a

third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those

who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for

revolution




that is true




on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending

not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their

stingthat is their moneyinto some one else who is not on his

guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into

a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state




yes he said there are plenty of themthat is certain




the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by

restricting a mans use of his own property or by another remedy




what other




one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to

look to their characterslet there be a general rule that every one

shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of

this scandalous moneymaking and the evils of which we were speaking will be

greatly lessened in the state




yes they will be greatly lessened




at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat

their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men

of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness

both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either

pleasure or pain




very true




they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the

pauper to the cultivation of virtue




yes quite as indifferent




such is the state of affairs which prevails among them and often rulers and

their subjects may come in one anothers way whether on a journey or on

some other occasion of meeting on a pilgrimage or a march as fellowsoldiers

or fellowsailors aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the

very moment of dangerfor where danger is there is no fear that the poor

will be despised by the richand very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man

may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his

complexion and has plenty of superfluous fleshwhen he sees such an one

puffing and at his witsend how can he avoid drawing the conclusion

that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them

and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another

our warriors are not good for much




yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking




and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may

bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a

commotion may arise withinin the same way wherever there is weakness in

the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasion may be very

slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other

their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with

herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause




yes surely




and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their

opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they

give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in

which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot




yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been

effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw




and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they

for as the government is such will be the man




clearly he said




in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and

franknessa man may say and do what he likes




tis said so he replied




and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his

own life as he pleases




clearly




then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures




there will




this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being like an embroidered

robe which is spangled with every sort of flower and just as women and

children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there

are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and

characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states




yes




yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a

government




why




because of the liberty which reigns therethey have a complete assortment

of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been

doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them

and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may

found his state




he will be sure to have patterns enough




and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if

you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when

the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are

so disposedthere being no necessity also because some law forbids you

to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast

if you have a fancyis not this a way of life which for the moment is

supremely delightful




for the moment yes




and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming have

you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been

sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the

worldthe gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares




yes he replied many and many a one




see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the dont

care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine

principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the cityas

when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never

will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things

of beauty and make of them a joy and a studyhow grandly does she trample

all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the

pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes

to be the peoples friend




yes she is of a noble spirit




these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a

charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a

sort of equality to equals and unequals alike




we know her well




consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider

as in the case of the state how he comes into being




very good he said




is not this the wayhe is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father

who has trained him in his own habits




exactly




and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the

spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary




obviously




would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the

necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures




i should




are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the

satisfaction is a benefit to us and they are rightly called so because we are

framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and

cannot help it




true




we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary




we are not




and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth

upwardsof which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases

the reverse of goodshall we not be right in saying that all these are

unnecessary




yes certainly




suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a

general notion of them




very good




will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so

far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class




that is what i should suppose




the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is

essential to the continuance of life




yes




but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health




certainly




and the desire which goes beyond this of more delicate food or other

luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in

youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of

wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary




very true




may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because

they conduce to production




certainly




and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good




true




and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and

desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he

who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical




very true




again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the

following as i suspect is commonly the process




what is the process




when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a

vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to

associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all

sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasurethen as you may imagine

the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the

democratical




inevitably




and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an

alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young

man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires

within him that which is akin and alike again helping that which is akin and

alike




certainly




and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him

whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then

there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war

with himself




it must be so




and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the

oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of

reverence enters into the young mans soul and order is restored




yes he said that sometimes happens




and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring

up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to

educate them wax fierce and numerous




yes he said that is apt to be the way




they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them

breed and multiply in him




very true




at length they seize upon the citadel of the young mans soul which they

perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words

which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are

their best guardians and sentinels




none better




false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place




they are certain to do so




and so the young man returns into the country of the lotuseaters and takes up

his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his

friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the

gate of the kings fastness and they will neither allow the embassy

itself to enter nor if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged

will they listen to them or receive them there is a battle and they gain the

day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into

exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in

the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly

expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil

appetites they drive them beyond the border




yes with a will




and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their

power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is

to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in

bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them

hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term

breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage

and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in

the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and

unnecessary pleasures




yes he said the change in him is visible enough




after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary

pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is

not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of

passion is oversupposing that he then readmits into the city some part

of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their

successorsin that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of

equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which

comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into

the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally




very true he said




neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice

if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and

noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour

some and chastise and master the otherswhenever this is repeated to him

he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as

another




yes he said that is the way with him




yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and

sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a

waterdrinker and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics

sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a

philosopher often he is busy with politics and starts to his feet and says

and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is

a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in

that his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he

terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on




yes he replied he is all liberty and equality




yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of

manyhe answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled

and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a

constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him




just so




let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the

democratic man




let that be his place he said




last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and

the tyrant these we have now to consider




quite true he said




say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arisethat it has a

democratic origin is evident




clearly




and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from

oligarchyi mean after a sort




how




the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was

maintained was excess of wealtham i not right




yes




and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the

sake of moneygetting was also the ruin of oligarchy




true




and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to

dissolution




what good




freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the

stateand that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature

deign to dwell




yes the saying is in every bodys mouth




i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of

other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for

tyranny




how so




when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding

over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then

unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls

them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs




yes he replied a very common occurrence




yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug

their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers

and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she

praises and honours both in private and public now in such a state can

liberty have any limit




certainly not




by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting

among the animals and infecting them




how do you mean




i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and

to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect

or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and the metic

is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is

quite as good as either




yes he said that is the way




and these are not the only evils i saidthere are several lesser ones

in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the

scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the

young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word

or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and

gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore

they adopt the manners of the young




quite true he said




the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money

whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i

forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each

other




why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips




that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not

know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are

under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for

truly the shedogs as the proverb says are as good as their shemistresses

and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and

dignities of freemen and they will run at any body who comes in their way if

he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to

burst with liberty




when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe you

and i have dreamed the same thing




and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens

become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length

as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they

will have no one over them




yes he said i know it too well




such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which

springs tyranny




glorious indeed he said but what is the next step




the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and

intensified by liberty overmasters democracythe truth being that the

excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite

direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and

animal life but above all in forms of government




true




the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass

into excess of slavery




yes the natural order




and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form

of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty




as we might expect




that however was not as i believe your questionyou rather desired to

know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy

and is the ruin of both




just so he replied




well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the

more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the followers the same whom

we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings




a very just comparison




these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated

being what phlegm and bile are to the body and the good physician and lawgiver

of the state ought like the wise beemaster to keep them at a distance and

prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way

in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible




yes by all means he said




then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine

democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first

place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in

the oligarchical state




that is true




and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified




how so




because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office

and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they

are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act

the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the

other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones




very true he said




then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass




what is that




they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders is sure to be the

richest




naturally so




they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to

the drones




why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little




and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them




that is pretty much the case he said




the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own

hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon this when

assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy




true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless

they get a little honey




and do they not share i said do not their leaders deprive the rich of their

estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to

reserve the larger part for themselves




why yes he said to that extent the people do share




and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend

themselves before the people as they best can




what else can they do




and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them

with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy




true




and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but

through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do

them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they

do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds

revolution in them




that is exactly the truth




then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another




true




the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into

greatness




yes that is their way




this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first

appears above ground he is a protector




yes that is quite clear




how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant clearly when he does

what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus




what tale




the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced

up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf did you

never hear it




oh yes




and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his

disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the

favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders

them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips

tasting the blood of his fellow citizens some he kills and others he banishes

at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and

after this what will be his destiny must he not either perish at the hands of

his enemies or from being a man become a wolfthat is a tyrant




inevitably




this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich




the same




after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a

tyrant full grown




that is clear




and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a

public accusation they conspire to assassinate him




yes he said that is their usual way




then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device of all

those who have got thus far in their tyrannical careerlet not the

peoples friend as they say be lost to them




exactly




the people readily assent all their fears are for himthey have none for

themselves




very true




and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the

people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus




by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed

to be a coward




and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again




but if he is caught he dies




of course




and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the

plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in

the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but

tyrant absolute




no doubt he said




and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in

which a creature like him is generated




yes he said let us consider that




at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes

every one whom he meetshe to be called a tyrant who is making promises

in public and also in private liberating debtors and distributing land to the

people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one




of course he said




but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is

nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in

order that the people may require a leader




to be sure




has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by

payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants

and therefore less likely to conspire against him




clearly




and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of

resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by

placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant

must be always getting up a war




he must




now he begins to grow unpopular




a necessary result




then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak

their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in

his teeth what is being done




yes that may be expected




and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while

he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything




he cannot




and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is

highminded who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them

all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has

made a purgation of the state




yes he said and a rare purgation




yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body

for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the

reverse




if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself




what a blessed alternative i saidto be compelled to dwell only with

the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all




yes that is the alternative




and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and

the greater devotion in them will he require




certainly




and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them




they will flock to him he said of their own accord if he pays them




by the dog i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land




yes he said there are




but will he not desire to get them on the spot




how do you mean




he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol

them in his bodyguard




to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all




what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the

others and has these for his trusted friends




yes he said they are quite of his sort




yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence

who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him




of course




verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian




why so




why because he is the author of the pregnant saying




tyrants are wise by living with the wise




and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his

companions




yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of

the same kind are said by him and by the other poets




and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any

others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state

because they are the eulogists of tyranny




yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us




but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices

fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and

democracies




very true




moreover they are paid for this and receive honourthe greatest honour

as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but

the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails

and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further




true




but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how

the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and everchanging

army of his




if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and

spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he

will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon

the people




and when these fail




why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female

will be maintained out of his fathers estate




you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will

maintain him and his companions




yes he said they cannot help themselves




but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a grownup son ought

not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by

the son the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in

order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his

own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions

but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be

emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are

termed and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father

might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates




by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been

fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that

he is weak and his son strong




why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence what beat his

father if he opposes him




yes he will having first disarmed him




then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is

real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is

the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has

fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves thus liberty getting out

of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of

slavery




true he said




very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the

nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny




yes quite enough he said




 book ix


last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how

is he formed out of the democratical and how does he live in happiness or in

misery




yes he said he is the only one remaining




there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered




what question




i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the

appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused




well he said it is not too late to supply the omission




very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of

the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one

appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and

by reason and the better desires prevail over themeither they are

wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they

are stronger and there are more of them




which appetites do you mean




i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is

asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and

having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no

conceivable folly or crimenot excepting incest or any other unnatural

union or parricide or the eating of forbidden foodwhich at such a

time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be

ready to commit




most true he said




but when a mans pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to

sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and

enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his

appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to

sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with

the higher principlewhich he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction

free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in

past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if

he has a quarrel against any onei say when after pacifying the two

irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes

his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely

to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions




i quite agree




in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i

desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless

wildbeast nature which peers out in sleep pray consider whether i am right

and you agree with me




yes i agree




and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man he

was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly

parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the

unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament




true




and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people

and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an

abhorrence of his fathers meanness at last being a better man than his

corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a

life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate

indulgence in various pleasures after this manner the democrat was generated

out of the oligarch




yes he said that was our view of him and is so still




and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man

such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his fathers

principles




i can imagine him




then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has

already happened to the fatherhe is drawn into a perfectly lawless

life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and

friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the

opposite ones as soon as these dire magicians and tyrantmakers find that they

are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion

to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lustsa sort of monstrous winged

dronethat is the only image which will adequately describe him




yes he said that is the only adequate image of him




and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and

wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing

around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in

his dronelike nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for

the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself

any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any

sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts

them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the

full




yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated




and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant




i should not wonder




further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant




he has




and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy

that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods




that he will




and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when

either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken

lustful passionate o my friend is not that so




assuredly




such is the man and such is his origin and next how does he live




suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me




i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts

and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love

is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul




that is certain




yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and

their demands are many




they are indeed he said




his revenues if he has any are soon spent




true




then comes debt and the cutting down of his property




of course




when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young

ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by

love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would

fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he

may gratify them




yes that is sure to be the case




he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs




he must




and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the

better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to

have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of

the property he will take a slice of theirs




no doubt he will




and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat

and deceive them




very true




and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them




yes probably




and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend will

the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them




nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents




but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot

who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would

strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very

existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is

brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he

would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of

friends for the sake of some newlyfound blooming youth who is the reverse of

indispensable




yes indeed he said i believe that he would




truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother




he is indeed he replied




he first takes their property and when that fails and pleasures are beginning

to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the

garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple

meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment

about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been

emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire these in

his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father

were only let loose in the dreams of sleep but now that he is under the

dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very

rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden

food or be guilty of any other horrid act love is his tyrant and lives

lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a

tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can

maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil

communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has

allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in

himself have we not here a picture of his way of life




yes indeed he said




and if there are only a few of them in the state and the rest of the people

are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers

of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no

war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city




what sort of mischief




for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of

temples manstealers of the community or if they are able to speak they turn

informers and bear false witness and take bribes




a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number




yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things

in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a

thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow

numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of

the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the

tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant




yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant




if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by

beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them

and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in

subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and

masters this is the end of his passions and desires




exactly




when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is

their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready

tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally

ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them

but when they have gained their point they know them no more




yes truly




they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of

anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship




certainly not




and may we not rightly call such men treacherous




no question




also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice




yes he said and we were perfectly right




let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the

waking reality of what we dreamed




most true




and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer

he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes




that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer




and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most

miserable and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and

truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general




yes he said inevitably




and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the

democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others




certainly




and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man




to be sure




then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is

under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue




they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other

is the very worst




there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at

once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their

relative happiness and misery and here we must not allow ourselves to be

panicstricken at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may

perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every

corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion




a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is

the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest




and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i

should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature he

must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous

aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one

who has a clear insight may i suppose that the judgment is given in the

hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place

with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family

relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in

the hour of public dangerhe shall tell us about the happiness and misery

of the tyrant when compared with other men




that again he said is a very fair proposal




shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have

before now met with such a person we shall then have some one who will answer

our enquiries




by all means




let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state

bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will

you tell me their respective conditions




what do you mean he asked




beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is

governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved




no city he said can be more completely enslaved




and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state




yes he said i see that there area few but the people speaking

generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved




then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail his

soul is full of meanness and vulgaritythe best elements in him are

enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and

maddest




inevitably




and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of

a slave




he has the soul of a slave in my opinion




and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting

voluntarily




utterly incapable




and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a

whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which

goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse




certainly




and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor




poor




and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable




true




and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear




yes indeed




is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and

groaning and pain




certainly not




and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in

the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires




impossible




reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be

the most miserable of states




and i was right he said




certainly i said and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what

do you say of him




i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men




there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong




what do you mean




i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery




then who is more miserable




one of whom i am about to speak




who is that




he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has

been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant




from what has been said i gather that you are right




yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain

and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and

evil is the greatest




very true he said




let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon

this subject




what is your illustration




the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you

may form an idea of the tyrants condition for they both have slaves

the only difference is that he has more slaves




yes that is the difference




you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their

servants




what should they fear




nothing but do you observe the reason of this




yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection

of each individual




very true i said but imagine one of these owners the master say of some

fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by

a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help himwill he

not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to

death by his slaves




yes he said he will be in the utmost fear




the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves

and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his

willhe will have to cajole his own servants




yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself




and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours

who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could

catch the offender would take his life




his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded

and watched by enemies




and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be boundhe

who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears

and lusts his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the

city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other

freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the

house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees

anything of interest




very true he said




and amid evils such as these will not he who is illgoverned in his own

personthe tyrannical man i meanwhom you just now decided to be

the most miserable of allwill not he be yet more miserable when instead

of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant

he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a

diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement

but fighting and combating with other men




yes he said the similitude is most exact




is not his case utterly miserable and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse

life than he whose life you determined to be the worst




certainly




he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is

obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the

flatterer of the vilest of mankind he has desires which he is utterly unable

to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how

to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and

is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles

and surely the resemblance holds




very true he said




moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he

becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more

friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and

cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely

miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself




no man of any sense will dispute your words




come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims

the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of

happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five

of them in allthey are the royal timocratical oligarchical

democratical tyrannical




the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on

the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the

criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery




need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best

has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he

who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most

unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the

greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state




make the proclamation yourself he said




and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men




let the words be added




then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may

also have some weight




what is that




the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the

individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles

the division may i think furnish a new demonstration




of what nature




it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also

three desires and governing powers




how do you mean he said




there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another

with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but

is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and

vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites

which are the main elements of it also moneyloving because such desires are

generally satisfied by the help of money




that is true he said




if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were

concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion

and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain

or money




i agree with you




again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and

getting fame




true




suppose we call it the contentious or ambitiouswould the term be

suitable




extremely suitable




on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly

directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or

fame




far less




lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles

which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul




certainly




one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as

may happen




yes




then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of menlovers

of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain




exactly




and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects




very true




now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of

their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and

depreciating that of others the moneymaker will contrast the vanity of honour

or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and

silver




true he said




and the lover of honourwhat will be his opinion will he not think that

the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings

no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him




very true




and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other

pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that

pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure

does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there

were no necessity for them he would rather not have them




there can be no doubt of that he replied




since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute

and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or

worse but which is the more pleasant or painlesshow shall we know who

speaks truly




i cannot myself tell he said




well but what ought to be the criterion is any better than experience and

wisdom and reason




there cannot be a better he said




then i said reflect of the three individuals which has the greatest

experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated has the lover of gain in

learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of

knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain




the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity

always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but

the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tastedor i

should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tastedthe

sweetness of learning and knowing truth




then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he

has a double experience




yes very great




again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of

honour of the pleasures of wisdom




nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object

for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of

admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the

pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of

true being is known to the philosopher only




his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one




far better




and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience




certainly




further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed

by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher




what faculty




reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest




yes




and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument




certainly




if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of

gain would surely be the most trustworthy




assuredly




or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgment of the ambitious

or pugnacious would be the truest




clearly




but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges




the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved

by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest




and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of

the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the

ruling principle has the pleasantest life




unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of

his own life




and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure

which is next




clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than

the moneymaker




last comes the lover of gain




very true he said




twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this

conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus

the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise

is quite true and pureall others are a shadow only and surely this will

prove the greatest and most decisive of falls




yes the greatest but will you explain yourself




i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions




proceed




say then is not pleasure opposed to pain




true




and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain




there is




a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about

eitherthat is what you mean




yes




you remember what people say when they are sick




what do they say




that after all nothing is pleasanter than health but then they never knew this

to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill




yes i know he said




and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say

that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain




i have




and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and

cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the

greatest pleasure




yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest




again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful




doubtless he said




then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain




so it would seem




but can that which is neither become both




i should say not




and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not




yes




but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in

a mean between them




yes




how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure

or that the absence of pleasure is pain




impossible




this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is to say the rest is

pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in

comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by

the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition




that is the inference




look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you

will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only

the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure




what are they he said and where shall i find them




there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are

very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they

depart leave no pain behind them




most true he said




let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of

pain or pain of pleasure




no




still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the

body are generally of this sortthey are reliefs of pain




that is true




and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature




yes




shall i give you an illustration of them




let me hear




you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle

region




i should




and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not

imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees

whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he

has never seen the true upper world




to be sure he said how can he think otherwise




but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he

was descending




no doubt




all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and

lower regions




yes




then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they

have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about

pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being

drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they

experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the

neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the

goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting

pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey

instead of whitecan you wonder i say at this




no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite




look at the matter thushunger thirst and the like are inanitions of

the bodily state




yes




and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul




true




and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either




certainly




and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has

more existence the truer




clearly from that which has more




what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your

judgmentthose of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of

sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge

and mind and all the different kinds of virtue put the question in this

waywhich has a more pure beingthat which is concerned with the

invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found

in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and

mortal and is itself variable and mortal




far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the

invariable




and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree

as of essence




yes of knowledge in the same degree




and of truth in the same degree




yes




and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence




necessarily




then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body

have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul




far less




and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul




yes




what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real

existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real

existence and is less real




of course




and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to

nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really

and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real

being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an

illusory and less real pleasure




unquestionably




those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony

and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region

they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper

world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are

they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding

pleasure like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads

stooping to the earth that is to the diningtable they fatten and feed and

breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at

one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one

another by reason of their insatiable lust for they fill themselves with that

which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also

unsubstantial and incontinent




verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an

oracle




their pleasures are mixed with painshow can they be otherwise for they

are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which

exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools

insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says

that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the

truth




something of that sort must inevitably happen




and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the

soul will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in

the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious

or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and

the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense




yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also




then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when

they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and

knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will

also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to

them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are

natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to

him




yes certainly the best is the most natural




and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no

division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business

and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable




exactly




but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its

own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow

only and which is not their own




true




and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason

the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure




yes




and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law

and order




clearly




and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest

distance yes




and the royal and orderly desires are nearest




yes




then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural

pleasure and the king at the least




certainly




but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most

pleasantly




inevitably




would you know the measure of the interval which separates them




will you tell me




there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the

transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run

away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain

slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority

can only be expressed in a figure




how do you mean




i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the

democrat was in the middle




yes




and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of

pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch




he will




and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and

aristocratical




yes he is third




then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is

three times three




manifestly




the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will

be a plane figure




certainly




and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty

in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king




yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum




or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which

the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when

the multiplication is completed living  times more pleasantly and the

tyrant more painfully by this same interval




what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates

the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain




yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life

if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 

nearly equals the number of days and nights in the year




yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them




then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and

unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in

beauty and virtue




immeasurably greater




well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may

revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that

injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just




yes that was said




now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let

us have a little conversation with him




what shall we say to him




let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented

before his eyes




of what sort




an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology

such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which

two or more different natures are said to grow into one




there are said of have been such unions




then do you now model the form of a multitudinous manyheaded monster having

a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to

generate and metamorphose at will




you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable

than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose




suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the

second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second




that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say




and now join them and let the three grow into one




that has been accomplished




next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he

who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the

beast to be a single human creature




i have done so he said




and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to

be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it

is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and

strengthen the lion and the lionlike qualities but to starve and weaken the

man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of

the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with

one anotherhe ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour

one another




certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says




to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and

act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete

mastery over the entire human creature he should watch over the manyheaded

monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities

and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the lionheart

his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts

with one another and with himself




yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say




and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the

approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong

and false and ignorant




yes from every point of view




come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally

in error sweet sir we will say to him what think you of

things esteemed noble and ignoble is not the noble that which subjects the

beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which

subjects the man to the beast he can hardly avoid saying yescan

he now




not if he has any regard for my opinion




but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then

how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he

was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst who can imagine that a man

who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them

into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might

be the sum which he received and will any one say that he is not a miserable

caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most

godless and detestable eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her

husbands life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse

ruin




yes said glaucon far worsei will answer for him




has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform

monster is allowed to be too much at large




clearly




and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element

in them disproportionately grows and gains strength




yes




and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same

creature and make a coward of him




very true




and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the

spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he

can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled

in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey




true he said




and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they

imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to

control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is

how to flatter them




such appears to be the reason




and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the

best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine

rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because

every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this

be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as

far as possible under the same government friends and equals




true he said




and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of

the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over

children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them

a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of

this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our

own and when this is done they may go their ways




yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest




from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is

profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a

worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness




from no point of view at all




what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished he who is

undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the

brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is

liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of

justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving

gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more

honourable than the body




certainly he said




to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his

life and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these

qualities on his soul and will disregard others




clearly he said




in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far

will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will

regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not

that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain

temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve

the harmony of the soul




certainly he will if he has true music in him




and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony

which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the

foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm




certainly not he said




he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder

occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon

this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his

means




very true




and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he

deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public

which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid




then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman




by the dog of egypt he will in the city which is his own he certainly will

though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call




i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the

founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is

such an one anywhere on earth




in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who

desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order but whether

such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live

after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other




i think so he said




 book x


of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is

none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry




to what do you refer




to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received

as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been

distinguished




what do you mean




speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the

tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribebut i do not mind saying

to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the

hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to

them




explain the purport of your remark




well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe

and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is

the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but

a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak

out




very good he said




listen to me then or rather answer me




put your question




can you tell me what imitation is for i really do not know




a likely thing then that i should know




why not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener




very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i

could not muster courage to utter it will you enquire yourself




well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of

individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding

idea or formdo you understand me




i do




let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the

worldplenty of them are there not




yes




but there are only two ideas or forms of themone the idea of a bed the

other of a table




true




and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in

accordance with the ideathat is our way of speaking in this and similar

instancesbut no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he




impossible




and there is another artisti should like to know what you would say of

him




who is he




one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen




what an extraordinary man




wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so for this is he

who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals

himself and all other thingsthe earth and heaven and the things which

are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also




he must be a wizard and no mistake




oh you are incredulous are you do you mean that there is no such maker or

creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in

another not do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all

yourself




what way




an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be

quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror

round and roundyou would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and

the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things

of which we were just now speaking in the mirror




yes he said but they would be appearances only




very good i said you are coming to the point now and the painter too is as

i conceive just such anothera creator of appearances is he not




of course




but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue and yet there

is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed




yes he said but not a real bed




and what of the maker of the bed were you not saying that he too makes not

the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a

particular bed




yes i did




then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but

only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of

the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could

hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth




at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the

truth




no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth




no wonder




suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this

imitator is




if you please




well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god

as i think that we may sayfor no one else can be the maker




no




there is another which is the work of the carpenter




yes




and the work of the painter is a third




yes




beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend

them god the maker of the bed and the painter




yes there are three of them




god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one

only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made

by god




why is that




because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them

which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed

and not the two others




very true he said




god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a

particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is

essentially and by nature one only




so we believe




shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed




yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the

author of this and of all other things




and what shall we say of the carpenteris not he also the maker of the

bed




yes




but would you call the painter a creator and maker




certainly not




yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed




i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that

which the others make




good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an

imitator




certainly he said




and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he

is thrice removed from the king and from the truth




that appears to be so




then about the imitator we are agreed and what about the painteri

would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally

exists in nature or only the creations of artists




the latter




as they are or as they appear you have still to determine this




what do you mean




i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or

directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different

but there is no difference in reality and the same of all things




yes he said the difference is only apparent




now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to

bean imitation of things as they are or as they appearof

appearance or of reality




of appearance




then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things

because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image for

example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though

he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive

children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from

a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter




certainly




and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts

and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher

degree of accuracy than any other manwhoever tells us this i think that

we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is likely to have been

deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought allknowing

because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance

and imitation




most true




and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at

their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and

divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows

his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we

ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion

perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may

not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations

thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge

of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities or after

all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which

they seem to the many to speak so well




the question he said should by all means be considered




now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as

the image he would seriously devote himself to the imagemaking branch would

he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing

higher in him




i should say not




the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in

realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of

himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he

would prefer to be the theme of them




yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit




then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of

the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask

him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left

behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only

talks about medicine and other arts at secondhand but we have a right to know

respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and

noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them

friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the

second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the

thirdnot an image maker or imitatorand if you are able to discern

what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what

state was ever better governed by your help the good order of lacedaemon is

due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly

benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them

and have done them any good italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is

solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about

you is there any city which he might name




i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was

a legislator




well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him

or aided by his counsels when he was alive




there is not




or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such

as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have

conceived which is attributed to him




there is absolutely nothing of the kind




but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher

of any had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who

handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by

pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are

to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him




nothing of the kind is recorded of him for surely socrates creophylus the

companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh

might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was

greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive




yes i replied that is the tradition but can you imagine glaucon that if

homer had really been able to educate and improve mankindif he had

possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitatorcan you imagine i say

that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them

protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to

whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either

your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of

educationand this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect

in making men love them that their companions all but carry them about on their

shoulders and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of

hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they

had really been able to make mankind virtuous would they not have been as

unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at

home with them or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have

followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough




yes socrates that i think is quite true




then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with

homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the

truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who as we have already

observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of

cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he

does and judge only by colours and figures




quite so




in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the

colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to

imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only

from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics

or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very

wellsuch is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have

and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance

the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon

them and recited in simple prose




yes he said




they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and

now the bloom of youth has passed away from them




exactly




here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true

existence he knows appearances only am i not right




yes




then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an

explanation




proceed




of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit




yes




and the worker in leather and brass will make them




certainly




but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins nay hardly even

the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how

to use themhe knows their right form




most true




and may we not say the same of all things




what




that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses

another which makes a third which imitates them




yes




and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate

and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the

artist has intended them




true




then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must

indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in

use for example the fluteplayer will tell the flutemaker which of his

flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make

them and the other will attend to his instructions




of course




the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and

badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told

by him




true




the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker

will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows

by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the

user will have knowledge




true




but will the imitator have either will he know from use whether or no his

drawing is correct or beautiful or will he have right opinion from being

compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about

what he should draw




neither




then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the

goodness or badness of his imitations




i suppose not




the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own

creations




nay very much the reverse




and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or

bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be

good to the ignorant multitude




just so




thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge

worth mentioning of what he imitates imitation is only a kind of play or

sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse

are imitators in the highest degree




very true




and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be

concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth




certainly




and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed




what do you mean




i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen

at a distance




true




and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and

crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the

illusion about colours to which the sight is liable thus every sort of

confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on

which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other

ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic




true




and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the

human understandingthere is the beauty of themand the apparent

greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but

give way before calculation and measure and weight




most true




and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in

the soul




to be sure




and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or

that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent

contradiction




true




but were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossiblethe same

faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing




very true




then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the

same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure




true




and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure

and calculation




certainly




and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the

soul




no doubt




this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that

painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper

work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates

of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they

have no true or healthy aim




exactly




the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior

offspring




very true




and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also

relating in fact to what we term poetry




probably the same would be true of poetry




do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but

let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical

imitation is concerned is good or bad




by all means




we may state the question thusimitation imitates the actions of men

whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad

result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly is there anything

more




no there is nothing else




but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with

himselfor rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and

opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not

strife and inconsistency in his life though i need hardly raise the question

again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has

been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar

oppositions occurring at the same moment




and we were right he said




yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now

be supplied




what was the omission




were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or

anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more

equanimity than another




yes




but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help

sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow




the latter he said is the truer statement




tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow

when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone




it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not




when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he

would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do




true




there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as

a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow




true




but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same

object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him




certainly




one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law




how do you mean




the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we

should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things

are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human

thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at

the moment is most required




what is most required he asked




that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have

been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like

children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time

in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a

remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow

by the healing art




yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune




yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of

reason




clearly




and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and

to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational

useless and cowardly




indeed we may




and does not the latteri mean the rebellious principlefurnish a

great variety of materials for imitation whereas the wise and calm

temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to

appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous

crowd is assembled in a theatre for the feeling represented is one to which

they are strangers




certainly




then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is

his art intended to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul

but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated




clearly




and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he

is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior

degree of truthin this i say he is like him and he is also like him

in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be

right in refusing to admit him into a wellordered state because he awakens

and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason as in a city

when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the

way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil

constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of

greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another

smallhe is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the

truth




exactly




but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our

accusationthe power which poetry has of harming even the good and

there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing




yes certainly if the effect is what you say




hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of

homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who

is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his

breastthe best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and

are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most




yes of course i know




but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we

pride ourselves on the opposite qualitywe would fain be quiet and

patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the

recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman




very true he said




now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which

any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person




no he said that is certainly not reasonable




nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view




what point of view




if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and

desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling

which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by

the poetsthe better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently

trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose

because the sorrow is anothers and the spectator fancies that there can

be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him

what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the

pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the

poem too few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of

other men something of evil is communicated to themselves and so the feeling

of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others

is with difficulty repressed in our own




how very true




and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous there are jests which you

would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in

private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all

disgusted at their unseemlinessthe case of pity is

repeatedthere is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise

a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid

of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the

risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into

playing the comic poet at home




quite true he said




and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of

desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every

actionin all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of

drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if

mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue




i cannot deny it




therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of

homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is

profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you

should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole

life according to him we may love and honour those who say these

thingsthey are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we

are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of

tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the

gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted

into our state for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter

either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by

common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the

rulers in our state




that is most true he said




and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence

serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of

our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason

constrained us but that she may not impute to us any harshness or want of

politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy

and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the

yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain

talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus

and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are

innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them notwithstanding this

let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she

will only prove her title to exist in a wellordered state we shall be

delighted to receive herwe are very conscious of her charms but we may

not on that account betray the truth i dare say glaucon that you are as much

charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer




yes indeed i am greatly charmed




shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this

condition onlythat she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some

other metre




certainly




and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and

yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not

only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we

will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be

the gainersi mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight




certainly he said we shall be the gainers




if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are

enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think

their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner

of lovers give her up though not without a struggle we too are inspired by

that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us

and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as

she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm

to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that

we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many

at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is

not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to

her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his

guard against her seductions and make our words his law




yes he said i quite agree with you




yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than

appears whether a man is to be good or bad and what will any one be profited

if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the

excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue




yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one

else would have been




and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await

virtue




what are there any greater still if there are they must be of an

inconceivable greatness




why i said what was ever great in a short time the whole period of three

score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity




say rather nothing he replied




and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than

of the whole




of the whole certainly but why do you ask




are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable




he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really

prepared to maintain this




yes i said i ought to be and you toothere is no difficulty in proving

it




i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of

which you make so light




listen then




i am attending




there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil




yes he replied




would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element

is the evil and the saving and improving element the good




yes




and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is

the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and

rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost

everything there is an inherent evil and disease




yes he said




and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last

wholly dissolves and dies




true




the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if

this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly

will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil




certainly not




if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be

dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no

destruction




that may be assumed




well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul




yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review

unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance




but does any of these dissolve or destroy herand here do not let us

fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is

detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul

take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes

and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just

now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to

them and inhering in them and so destroying them is not this true




yes




consider the soul in like manner does the injustice or other evil which exists

in the soul waste and consume her do they by attaching to the soul and

inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body




certainly not




and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from

without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from

within by a corruption of its own




it is he replied




consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness

decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is

not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates

corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by

a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the

body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is

another and which does not engender any natural infectionthis we shall

absolutely deny




very true




and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the

soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved

by any merely external evil which belongs to another




yes he said there is reason in that




either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted

let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the

throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can

destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or

unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the

soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed

by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man




and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become

more unjust in consequence of death




but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly

denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and

unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like

disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take

this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has

and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in

which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the

penalty of their deeds




nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so

very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil but i rather suspect

the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power

will murder others keeps the murderer aliveaye and well awake too so

far removed is her dwellingplace from being a house of death




true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to

kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction

of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was

appointed to be the destruction




yes that can hardly be




but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or

external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal




certainly




that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must

always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number

neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come

from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality




very true




but this we cannot believereason will not allow usany more than

we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and

difference and dissimilarity




what do you mean he said




the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of

compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements




certainly not




her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many

other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred

by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with

the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be

revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described

will be manifested more clearly thus far we have spoken the truth concerning

her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her

only in a condition which may be compared to that of the seagod glaucus whose

original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken

off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and

incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he

is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form and the soul

which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills but

not there glaucon not there must we look




where then




at her love of wisdom let us see whom she affects and what society and

converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal

and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this

superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she

now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock

which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is

overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would

see her as she is and know whether she have one shape only or many or what

her nature is of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this

present life i think that we have now said enough




true he replied




and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not

introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are

to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown

to be best for the soul in her own nature let a man do what is just whether

he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges

he put on the helmet of hades




very true




and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how

great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul

from gods and men both in life and after death




certainly not he said




will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument




what did i borrow




the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for

you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly

escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the

sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure

injustice do you remember




i should be much to blame if i had forgotten




then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the

estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be

her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer

reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been

taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which

is hers also and which she gives to her own




the demand he said is just




in the first place i saidand this is the first thing which you will

have to give backthe nature both of the just and unjust is truly known

to the gods




granted




and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the

enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning




true




and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at

their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former

sins




certainly




then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty

or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work

together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one

whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the

divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue




yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him




and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed




certainly




such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just




that is my conviction




and what do they receive of men look at things as they really are and you

will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from

the startingplace to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at

a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears

draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to

the finish and receives the prize and is crowned and this is the way with the

just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life

has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow




true




and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were

attributing to the fortunate unjust i shall say of them what you were saying

of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if

they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they

will all that you said of the others i now say of these and on the other

hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in

their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course

and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and

citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as

you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you

were saying and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your

tale of horrors but will you let me assume without reciting them that these

things are true




certainly he said what you say is true




these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the

just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things

which justice of herself provides




yes he said and they are fair and lasting




and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in

comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after

death and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have

received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them




speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear




well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells

to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius

a pamphylian by birth he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when

the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body

was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried and on the

twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told

them what he had seen in the other world he said that when his soul left the

body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a

mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near

together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above in

the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after

they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them

to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust

were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also

bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs he drew near and

they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the

other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and

seen in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at

either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at

the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and

worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright and arriving

ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth

with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those

who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth

curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from

heaven about the things beneath and they told one another of what had happened

by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the

things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now

the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing

heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty the story glaucon

would take too long to tell but the sum was thishe said that for every

wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a

hundred yearssuch being reckoned to be the length of mans life

and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years if for example

there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or

enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each

and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the

rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion i

need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon

as they were born of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers

there were retributions other and greater far which he described he mentioned

that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is

ardiaeus the great now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the

time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered

his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many

other abominable crimes the answer of the other spirit was he comes

not hither and will never come and this said he was one of the

dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed we were at the mouth of the

cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when

of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants

and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great

criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper

world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of

these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished

tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and

heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they

bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with

scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns

like wool and declaring to the passersby what were their crimes and that

they were being taken away to be cast into hell and of all the many

terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror

which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and

when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy these

said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as

great




now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the

eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day

after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line

of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and

through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer

another days journey brought them to the place and there in the midst

of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above

for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the

universe like the undergirders of a trireme from these ends is extended the

spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn the shaft and hook of

this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also

partly of other materials now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on

earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl

which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and

another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which

fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on

their lower side all together form one continuous whorl this is pierced by the

spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth the first and

outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower

in the following proportionsthe sixth is next to the first in size the

fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the

fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second the

largest or fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest

the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second

and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower

than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars

is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second now the whole spindle

has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven

inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the

eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move

together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this

reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth the

spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each

circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note the

eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is

another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the

fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets

upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their

voices the harmony of the sirenslachesis singing of the past clotho of

the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a

touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or

spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones

and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with

the other




when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but

first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from

the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high

pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of

necessity mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality your genius

will not be allotted to you but you will choose your genius and let him who

draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall

be his destiny virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will

have more or less of her the responsibility is with the choosergod is

justified when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots

indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near

him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot

perceived the number which he had obtained then the interpreter placed on the

ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than

the souls present and they were of all sorts there were lives of every animal

and of man in every condition and there were tyrannies among them some

lasting out the tyrants life others which broke off in the middle and

came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous

men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their

strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of

their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite

qualities and of women likewise there was not however any definite

character in them because the soul when choosing a new life must of

necessity become different but there was every other quality and the all

mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and

disease and health and there were mean states also and here my dear glaucon

is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should

be taken let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and

follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find

some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and

so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity he

should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned

severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of

beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what

are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and

public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of

all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul and the operation of them when

conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the

consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the

better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil

to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which

will make his soul more just all else he will disregard for we have seen and

know that this is the best choice both in life and after death a man must take

with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that

there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements

of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable

wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose

the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in

this life but in all that which is to come for this is the way of happiness




and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what

the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses

wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable

existence let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last

despair and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came

forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been

darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter

before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among

other evils to devour his own children but when he had time to reflect and

saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his

choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing

the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and

everything rather than himself now he was one of those who came from heaven

and in a former life had dwelt in a wellordered state but his virtue was a

matter of habit only and he had no philosophy and it was true of others who

were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and

therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came

from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a

hurry to choose and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the

lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an

evil for a good for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated

himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate

in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here

and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough

and underground would be smooth and heavenly most curious he said was the

spectaclesad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was

in most cases based on their experience of a previous life there he saw the

soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to

the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his

murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a

nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians

wanting to be men the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of

a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a

man remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the

arms the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like

ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings about the middle came

the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to

resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son

of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far

away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on

the form of a monkey there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a

choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all now the recollection

of former toils had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a

considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he

had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been

neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have

done the same had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted

to have it and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention

that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into

corresponding human naturesthe good into the gentle and the evil into

the savage in all sorts of combinations




all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their

choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally

chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this

genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of

the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then

when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads

and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath

the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a

scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste

destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the

river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all

obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom

drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things now

after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a

thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in

all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting he himself was hindered

from drinking the water but in what manner or by what means he returned to the

body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself

lying on the pyre




and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save

us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the

river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled wherefore my counsel

is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and

virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every

sort of good and every sort of evil thus shall we live dear to one another and

to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games

who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward and it shall be well with

us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have

been describing

      introduction

    


      the phaedrus is closely connected with the symposium and may be regarded

      either as introducing or following it the two dialogues together contain

      the whole philosophy of plato on the nature of love which in the republic

      and in the later writings of plato is only introduced playfully or as a

      figure of speech but in the phaedrus and symposium love and philosophy

      join hands and one is an aspect of the other the spiritual and emotional

      part is elevated into the ideal to which in the symposium mankind are

      described as looking forward and which in the phaedrus as well as in the

      phaedo they are seeking to recover from a former state of existence

      whether the subject of the dialogue is love or rhetoric or the union of

      the two or the relation of philosophy to love and to art in general and

      to the human soul will be hereafter considered and perhaps we may arrive

      at some conclusion such as the followingthat the dialogue is not

      strictly confined to a single subject but passes from one to another with

      the natural freedom of conversation

    


      phaedrus has been spending the morning with lysias the celebrated

      rhetorician and is going to refresh himself by taking a walk outside the

      wall when he is met by socrates who professes that he will not leave him

      until he has delivered up the speech with which lysias has regaled him

      and which he is carrying about in his mind or more probably in a book

      hidden under his cloak and is intending to study as he walks the

      imputation is not denied and the two agree to direct their steps out of

      the public way along the stream of the ilissus towards a planetree which

      is seen in the distance there lying down amidst pleasant sounds and

      scents they will read the speech of lysias the country is a novelty to

      socrates who never goes out of the town and hence he is full of

      admiration for the beauties of nature which he seems to be drinking in

      for the first time

    


      as they are on their way phaedrus asks the opinion of socrates respecting

      the local tradition of boreas and oreithyia socrates after a satirical

      allusion to the rationalizers of his day replies that he has no time

      for these nice interpretations of mythology and he pities anyone who

      has when you once begin there is no end of them and they spring from an

      uncritical philosophy after all the proper study of mankind is man and

      he is a far more complex and wonderful being than the serpent typho

      socrates as yet does not know himself and why should he care to know

      about unearthly monsters engaged in such conversation they arrive at the

      planetree when they have found a convenient restingplace phaedrus

      pulls out the speech and reads

    


      the speech consists of a foolish paradox which is to the effect that the

      nonlover ought to be accepted rather than the loverbecause he is

      more rational more agreeable more enduring less suspicious less

      hurtful less boastful less engrossing and because there are more of

      them and for a great many other reasons which are equally unmeaning

      phaedrus is captivated with the beauty of the periods and wants to make

      socrates say that nothing was or ever could be written better socrates

      does not think much of the matter but then he has only attended to the

      form and in that he has detected several repetitions and other marks of

      haste he cannot agree with phaedrus in the extreme value which he sets

      upon this performance because he is afraid of doing injustice to anacreon

      and sappho and other great writers and is almost inclined to think that

      he himself or rather some power residing within him could make a speech

      better than that of lysias on the same theme and also different from his

      if he may be allowed the use of a few commonplaces which all speakers must

      equally employ

    


      phaedrus is delighted at the prospect of having another speech and

      promises that he will set up a golden statue of socrates at delphi if he

      keeps his word some raillery ensues and at length socrates conquered by

      the threat that he shall never again hear a speech of lysias unless he

      fulfils his promise veils his face and begins

    


      first invoking the muses and assuming ironically the person of the

      nonlover who is a lover all the same he will enquire into the nature

      and power of love for this is a necessary preliminary to the other

      questionhow is the nonlover to be distinguished from the lover in

      all of us there are two principlesa better and a worsereason

      and desire which are generally at war with one another and the victory

      of the rational is called temperance and the victory of the irrational

      intemperance or excess the latter takes many forms and has many bad namesgluttony

      drunkenness and the like but of all the irrational desires or excesses

      the greatest is that which is led away by desires of a kindred nature to

      the enjoyment of personal beauty and this is the master power of love

    


      here socrates fancies that he detects in himself an unusual flow of

      eloquencethis newlyfound gift he can only attribute to the

      inspiration of the place which appears to be dedicated to the nymphs

      starting again from the philosophical basis which has been laid down he

      proceeds to show how many advantages the nonlover has over the lover the

      one encourages softness and effeminacy and exclusiveness he cannot endure

      any superiority in his beloved he will train him in luxury he will keep

      him out of society he will deprive him of parents friends money

      knowledge and of every other good that he may have him all to himself

      then again his ways are not ways of pleasantness he is mighty

      disagreeable crabbed age and youth cannot live together at every hour

      of the night and day he is intruding upon him there is the same old

      withered face and the remainder to matchand he is always repeating

      in season or out of season the praises or dispraises of his beloved

      which are bad enough when he is sober and published all over the world

      when he is drunk at length his love ceases he is converted into an

      enemy and the spectacle may be seen of the lover running away from the

      beloved who pursues him with vain reproaches and demands his reward

      which the other refuses to pay too late the beloved learns after all his

      pains and disagreeables that as wolves love lambs so lovers love their

      loves compare char here is the end the other or nonlover part

      of the speech had better be understood for if in the censure of the lover

      socrates has broken out in verse what will he not do in his praise of the

      nonlover he has said his say and is preparing to go away

    


      phaedrus begs him to remain at any rate until the heat of noon has

      passed he would like to have a little more conversation before they go

      socrates who has risen recognizes the oracular sign which forbids him to

      depart until he has done penance his conscious has been awakened and

      like stesichorus when he had reviled the lovely helen he will sing a

      palinode for having blasphemed the majesty of love his palinode takes the

      form of a myth

    


      socrates begins his tale with a glorification of madness which he divides

      into four kinds first there is the art of divination or prophecythis

      in a vein similar to that pervading the cratylus and io he connects with

      madness by an etymological explanation mantike manikecompare

      oionoistike oionistike tis all one reckoning save the phrase is a

      little variations secondly there is the art of purification by

      mysteries thirdly poetry or the inspiration of the muses compare ion

      without which no man can enter their temple all this shows that madness

      is one of heavens blessings and may sometimes be a great deal better

      than sense there is also a fourth kind of madnessthat of lovewhich

      cannot be explained without enquiring into the nature of the soul

    


      all soul is immortal for she is the source of all motion both in herself

      and in others her form may be described in a figure as a composite nature

      made up of a charioteer and a pair of winged steeds the steeds of the

      gods are immortal but ours are one mortal and the other immortal the

      immortal soul soars upwards into the heavens but the mortal drops her

      plumes and settles upon the earth

    


      now the use of the wing is to rise and carry the downward element into the

      upper worldthere to behold beauty wisdom goodness and the other

      things of god by which the soul is nourished on a certain day zeus the

      lord of heaven goes forth in a winged chariot and an array of gods and

      demigods and of human souls in their train follows him there are

      glorious and blessed sights in the interior of heaven and he who will may

      freely behold them the great vision of all is seen at the feast of the

      gods when they ascend the heights of the empyreanall but hestia

      who is left at home to keep house the chariots of the gods glide readily

      upwards and stand upon the outside the revolution of the spheres carries

      them round and they have a vision of the world beyond but the others

      labour in vain for the mortal steed if he has not been properly trained

      keeps them down and sinks them towards the earth of the world which is

      beyond the heavens who can tell there is an essence formless

      colourless intangible perceived by the mind only dwelling in the region

      of true knowledge the divine mind in her revolution enjoys this fair

      prospect and beholds justice temperance and knowledge in their

      everlasting essence when fulfilled with the sight of them she returns

      home and the charioteer puts up the horses in their stable and gives

      them ambrosia to eat and nectar to drink this is the life of the gods

      the human soul tries to reach the same heights but hardly succeeds and

      sometimes the head of the charioteer rises above and sometimes sinks

      below the fair vision and he is at last obliged after much contention

      to turn away and leave the plain of truth but if the soul has followed in

      the train of her god and once beheld truth she is preserved from harm and

      is carried round in the next revolution of the spheres and if always

      following and always seeing the truth is then for ever unharmed if

      however she drops her wings and falls to the earth then she takes the

      form of man and the soul which has seen most of the truth passes into a

      philosopher or lover that which has seen truth in the second degree into

      a king or warrior the third into a householder or moneymaker the

      fourth into a gymnast the fifth into a prophet or mystic the sixth

      into a poet or imitator the seventh into a husbandman or craftsman the

      eighth into a sophist or demagogue the ninth into a tyrant all these

      are states of probation wherein he who lives righteously is improved and

      he who lives unrighteously deteriorates after death comes the judgment

      the bad depart to houses of correction under the earth the good to places

      of joy in heaven when a thousand years have elapsed the souls meet

      together and choose the lives which they will lead for another period of

      existence the soul which three times in succession has chosen the life of

      a philosopher or of a lover who is not without philosophy receives her

      wings at the close of the third millennium the remainder have to complete

      a cycle of ten thousand years before their wings are restored to them

      each time there is full liberty of choice the soul of a man may descend

      into a beast and return again into the form of man but the form of man

      will only be taken by the soul which has once seen truth and acquired some

      conception of the universalthis is the recollection of the

      knowledge which she attained when in the company of the gods and men in

      general recall only with difficulty the things of another world but the

      mind of the philosopher has a better remembrance of them for when he

      beholds the visible beauty of earth his enraptured soul passes in thought

      to those glorious sights of justice and wisdom and temperance and truth

      which she once gazed upon in heaven then she celebrated holy mysteries

      and beheld blessed apparitions shining in pure light herself pure and

      not as yet entombed in the body and still like a bird eager to quit its

      cage she flutters and looks upwards and is therefore deemed mad such a

      recollection of past days she receives through sight the keenest of our

      senses because beauty alone of the ideas has any representation on

      earth wisdom is invisible to mortal eyes but the corrupted nature

      blindly excited by this vision of beauty rushes on to enjoy and would

      fain wallow like a brute beast in sensual pleasures whereas the true

      mystic who has seen the many sights of bliss when he beholds a godlike

      form or face is amazed with delight and if he were not afraid of being

      thought mad he would fall down and worship then the stiffened wing begins

      to relax and grow again desire which has been imprisoned pours over the

      soul of the lover the germ of the wing unfolds and stings and pangs of

      birth like the cutting of teeth are everywhere felt compare symp

      father and mother and goods and laws and proprieties are nothing to him

      his beloved is his physician who can alone cure his pain an apocryphal

      sacred writer says that the power which thus works in him is by mortals

      called love but the immortals call him dove or the winged one in order

      to represent the force of his wingssuch at any rate is his nature

      now the characters of lovers depend upon the god whom they followed in the

      other world and they choose their loves in this world accordingly the

      followers of ares are fierce and violent those of zeus seek out some

      philosophical and imperial nature the attendants of here find a royal

      love and in like manner the followers of every god seek a love who is

      like their god and to him they communicate the nature which they have

      received from their god the manner in which they take their love is as

      follows

    


      i told you about the charioteer and his two steeds the one a noble animal

      who is guided by word and admonition only the other an illlooking

      villain who will hardly yield to blow or spur together all three who are

      a figure of the soul approach the vision of love and now a fierce

      conflict begins the illconditioned steed rushes on to enjoy but the

      charioteer who beholds the beloved with awe falls back in adoration and

      forces both the steeds on their haunches again the evil steed rushes

      forwards and pulls shamelessly the conflict grows more and more severe

      and at last the charioteer throwing himself backwards forces the bit out

      of the clenched teeth of the brute and pulling harder than ever at the

      reins covers his tongue and jaws with blood and forces him to rest his

      legs and haunches with pain upon the ground when this has happened

      several times the villain is tamed and humbled and from that time

      forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in modesty and holy

      fear and now their bliss is consummated the same image of love dwells in

      the breast of either and if they have selfcontrol they pass their lives

      in the greatest happiness which is attainable by manthey continue

      masters of themselves and conquer in one of the three heavenly victories

      but if they choose the lower life of ambition they may still have a happy

      destiny though inferior because they have not the approval of the whole

      soul at last they leave the body and proceed on their pilgrims progress

      and those who have once begun can never go back when the time comes they

      receive their wings and fly away and the lovers have the same wings

    


      socrates concludes

    


      these are the blessings of love and thus have i made my recantation in

      finer language than before i did so in order to please phaedrus if i

      said what was wrong at first please to attribute my error to lysias who

      ought to study philosophy instead of rhetoric and then he will not

      mislead his disciple phaedrus

    


      phaedrus is afraid that he will lose conceit of lysias and that lysias

      will be out of conceit with himself and leave off making speeches for

      the politicians have been deriding him socrates is of opinion that there

      is small danger of this the politicians are themselves the great

      rhetoricians of the age who desire to attain immortality by the

      authorship of laws and therefore there is nothing with which they can

      reproach lysias in being a writer but there may be disgrace in being a

      bad one

    


      and what is good or bad writing or speaking while the sun is hot in the

      sky above us let us ask that question since by rational conversation man

      lives and not by the indulgence of bodily pleasures and the grasshoppers

      who are chirruping around may carry our words to the muses who are their

      patronesses for the grasshoppers were human beings themselves in a world

      before the muses and when the muses came they died of hunger for the love

      of song and they carry to them in heaven the report of those who honour

      them on earth

    


      the first rule of good speaking is to know and speak the truth as a

      spartan proverb says true art is truth whereas rhetoric is an art of

      enchantment which makes things appear good and evil like and unlike as

      the speaker pleases its use is not confined as people commonly suppose

      to arguments in the law courts and speeches in the assembly it is rather

      a part of the art of disputation under which are included both the rules

      of gorgias and the eristic of zeno but it is not wholly devoid of truth

      superior knowledge enables us to deceive another by the help of

      resemblances and to escape from such a deception when employed against

      ourselves we see therefore that even in rhetoric an element of truth is

      required for if we do not know the truth we can neither make the gradual

      departures from truth by which men are most easily deceived nor guard

      ourselves against deception

    


      socrates then proposes that they shall use the two speeches as

      illustrations of the art of rhetoric first distinguishing between the

      debatable and undisputed class of subjects in the debatable class there

      ought to be a definition of all disputed matters but there was no such

      definition in the speech of lysias nor is there any order or connection

      in his words any more than in a nursery rhyme with this he compares the

      regular divisions of the other speech which was his own and yet not his

      own for the local deities must have inspired him although only a

      playful composition it will be found to embody two principles first

      that of synthesis or the comprehension of parts in a whole secondly

      analysis or the resolution of the whole into parts these are the

      processes of division and generalization which are so dear to the

      dialectician that king of men they are effected by dialectic and not by

      rhetoric of which the remains are but scanty after order and arrangement

      have been subtracted there is nothing left but a heap of ologies and

      other technical terms invented by polus theodorus evenus tisias

      gorgias and others who have rules for everything and who teach how to

      be short or long at pleasure prodicus showed his good sense when he said

      that there was a better thing than either to be short or long which was

      to be of convenient length

    


      still notwithstanding the absurdities of polus and others rhetoric has

      great power in public assemblies this power however is not given by any

      technical rules but is the gift of genius the real art is always being

      confused by rhetoricians with the preliminaries of the art the perfection

      of oratory is like the perfection of anything else natural power must be

      aided by art but the art is not that which is taught in the schools of

      rhetoric it is nearer akin to philosophy pericles for instance who was

      the most accomplished of all speakers derived his eloquence not from

      rhetoric but from the philosophy of nature which he learnt of anaxagoras

      true rhetoric is like medicine and the rhetorician has to consider the

      natures of mens souls as the physician considers the natures of their

      bodies such and such persons are to be affected in this way such and

      such others in that and he must know the times and the seasons for saying

      this or that this is not an easy task and this if there be such an art

      is the art of rhetoric

    


      i know that there are some professors of the art who maintain probability

      to be stronger than truth but we maintain that probability is engendered

      by likeness of the truth which can only be attained by the knowledge of

      it and that the aim of the good man should not be to please or persuade

      his fellowservants but to please his good masters who are the gods

      rhetoric has a fair beginning in this

    


      enough of the art of speaking let us now proceed to consider the true use

      of writing there is an old egyptian tale of theuth the inventor of

      writing showing his invention to the god thamus who told him that he

      would only spoil mens memories and take away their understandings from

      this tale of which young athens will probably make fun may be gathered

      the lesson that writing is inferior to speech for it is like a picture

      which can give no answer to a question and has only a deceitful likeness

      of a living creature it has no power of adaptation but uses the same

      words for all it is not a legitimate son of knowledge but a bastard and

      when an attack is made upon this bastard neither parent nor anyone else is

      there to defend it the husbandman will not seriously incline to sow his

      seed in such a hotbed or garden of adonis he will rather sow in the

      natural soil of the human soul which has depth of earth and he will

      anticipate the inner growth of the mind by writing only if at all as a

      remedy against old age the natural process will be far nobler and will

      bring forth fruit in the minds of others as well as in his own

    


      the conclusion of the whole matter is just thisthat until a man

      knows the truth and the manner of adapting the truth to the natures of

      other men he cannot be a good orator also that the living is better

      than the written word and that the principles of justice and truth when

      delivered by word of mouth are the legitimate offspring of a mans own

      bosom and their lawful descendants take up their abode in others such an

      orator as he is who is possessed of them you and i would fain become and

      to all composers in the world poets orators legislators we hereby

      announce that if their compositions are based upon these principles then

      they are not only poets orators legislators but philosophers all

      others are mere flatterers and putters together of words this is the

      message which phaedrus undertakes to carry to lysias from the local

      deities and socrates himself will carry a similar message to his

      favourite isocrates whose future distinction as a great rhetorician he

      prophesies the heat of the day has passed and after offering up a prayer

      to pan and the nymphs socrates and phaedrus depart

    


      there are two principal controversies which have been raised about the

      phaedrus the first relates to the subject the second to the date of the

      dialogue

    


      there seems to be a notion that the work of a great artist like plato

      cannot fail in unity and that the unity of a dialogue requires a single

      subject but the conception of unity really applies in very different

      degrees and ways to different kinds of art to a statue for example far

      more than to any kind of literary composition and to some species of

      literature far more than to others nor does the dialogue appear to be a

      style of composition in which the requirement of unity is most stringent

      nor should the idea of unity derived from one sort of art be hastily

      transferred to another the double titles of several of the platonic

      dialogues are a further proof that the severer rule was not observed by

      plato the republic is divided between the search after justice and the

      construction of the ideal state the parmenides between the criticism of

      the platonic ideas and of the eleatic one or being the gorgias between

      the art of speaking and the nature of the good the sophist between the

      detection of the sophist and the correlation of ideas the theaetetus the

      politicus and the philebus have also digressions which are but remotely

      connected with the main subject

    


      thus the comparison of platos other writings as well as the reason of

      the thing lead us to the conclusion that we must not expect to find one

      idea pervading a whole work but one two or more as the invention of

      the writer may suggest or his fancy wander if each dialogue were

      confined to the development of a single idea this would appear on the

      face of the dialogue nor could any controversy be raised as to whether

      the phaedrus treated of love or rhetoric but the truth is that plato

      subjects himself to no rule of this sort like every great artist he gives

      unity of form to the different and apparently distracting topics which he

      brings together he works freely and is not to be supposed to have

      arranged every part of the dialogue before he begins to write he fastens

      or weaves together the frame of his discourse loosely and imperfectly and

      which is the warp and which is the woof cannot always be determined

    


      the subjects of the phaedrus exclusive of the short introductory passage

      about mythology which is suggested by the local tradition are first the

      false or conventional art of rhetoric secondly love or the inspiration

      of beauty and knowledge which is described as madness thirdly dialectic

      or the art of composition and division fourthly the true rhetoric which

      is based upon dialectic and is neither the art of persuasion nor

      knowledge of the truth alone but the art of persuasion founded on

      knowledge of truth and knowledge of character fifthly the superiority of

      the spoken over the written word the continuous thread which appears and

      reappears throughout is rhetoric this is the ground into which the rest

      of the dialogue is worked in parts embroidered with fine words which are

      not in socrates manner as he says in order to please phaedrus the

      speech of lysias which has thrown phaedrus into an ecstacy is adduced as

      an example of the false rhetoric the first speech of socrates though an

      improvement partakes of the same character his second speech which is

      full of that higher element said to have been learned of anaxagoras by

      pericles and which in the midst of poetry does not forget order is an

      illustration of the higher or true rhetoric this higher rhetoric is based

      upon dialectic and dialectic is a sort of inspiration akin to love

      compare symp in these two aspects of philosophy the technicalities of

      rhetoric are absorbed and so the example becomes also the deeper theme of

      discourse the true knowledge of things in heaven and earth is based upon

      enthusiasm or love of the ideas going before us and ever present to us in

      this world and in another and the true order of speech or writing

      proceeds accordingly love again has three degrees first of interested

      love corresponding to the conventionalities of rhetoric secondly of

      disinterested or mad love fixed on objects of sense and answering

      perhaps to poetry thirdly of disinterested love directed towards the

      unseen answering to dialectic or the science of the ideas lastly the

      art of rhetoric in the lower sense is found to rest on a knowledge of the

      natures and characters of men which socrates at the commencement of the

      dialogue has described as his own peculiar study

    


      thus amid discord a harmony begins to appear there are many links of

      connection which are not visible at first sight at the same time the

      phaedrus although one of the most beautiful of the platonic dialogues is

      also more irregular than any other for insight into the world for

      sustained irony for depth of thought there is no dialogue superior or

      perhaps equal to it nevertheless the form of the work has tended to

      obscure some of platos higher aims

    


      the first speech is composed in that balanced style in which the wise

      love to talk symp the characteristics of rhetoric are insipidity

      mannerism and monotonous parallelism of clauses there is more rhythm

      than reason the creative power of imagination is wanting

    


      tis greece but living greece no more

    


      plato has seized by anticipation the spirit which hung over greek

      literature for a thousand years afterwards yet doubtless there were some

      who like phaedrus felt a delight in the harmonious cadence and the

      pedantic reasoning of the rhetoricians newly imported from sicily which

      had ceased to be awakened in them by really great works such as the odes

      of anacreon or sappho or the orations of pericles that the first speech

      was really written by lysias is improbable like the poem of solon or the

      story of thamus and theuth or the funeral oration of aspasia if

      genuine or the pretence of socrates in the cratylus that his knowledge

      of philology is derived from euthyphro the invention is really due to the

      imagination of plato and may be compared to the parodies of the sophists

      in the protagoras numerous fictions of this sort occur in the dialogues

      and the gravity of plato has sometimes imposed upon his commentators the

      introduction of a considerable writing of another would seem not to be in

      keeping with a great work of art and has no parallel elsewhere

    


      in the second speech socrates is exhibited as beating the rhetoricians at

      their own weapons he an unpractised man and they masters of the art

      true to his character he must however profess that the speech which he

      makes is not his own for he knows nothing of himself compare symp

      regarded as a rhetorical exercise the superiority of his speech seems to

      consist chiefly in a better arrangement of the topics he begins with a

      definition of love and he gives weight to his words by going back to

      general maxims a lesser merit is the greater liveliness of socrates

      which hurries him into verse and relieves the monotony of the style

    


      but plato had doubtless a higher purpose than to exhibit socrates as the

      rival or superior of the athenian rhetoricians even in the speech of

      lysias there is a germ of truth and this is further developed in the

      parallel oration of socrates first passionate love is overthrown by the

      sophistical or interested and then both yield to that higher view of love

      which is afterwards revealed to us the extreme of commonplace is

      contrasted with the most ideal and imaginative of speculations socrates

      half in jest and to satisfy his own wild humour takes the disguise of

      lysias but he is also in profound earnest and in a deeper vein of irony

      than usual having improvised his own speech which is based upon the

      model of the preceding he condemns them both yet the condemnation is not

      to be taken seriously for he is evidently trying to express an aspect of

      the truth to understand him we must make abstraction of morality and of

      the greek manner of regarding the relation of the sexes in this as in

      his other discussions about love what plato says of the loves of men must

      be transferred to the loves of women before we can attach any serious

      meaning to his words had he lived in our times he would have made the

      transposition himself but seeing in his own age the impossibility of

      woman being the intellectual helpmate or friend of man except in the rare

      instances of a diotima or an aspasia seeing that even as to personal

      beauty her place was taken by young mankind instead of womankind he

      tries to work out the problem of love without regard to the distinctions

      of nature and full of the evils which he recognized as flowing from the

      spurious form of love he proceeds with a deep meaning though partly in

      joke to show that the nonlovers love is better than the lovers

    


      we may raise the same question in another form is marriage preferable

      with or without love among ourselves as we may say a little parodying

      the words of pausanias in the symposium there would be one answer to

      this question the practice and feeling of some foreign countries appears

      to be more doubtful suppose a modern socrates in defiance of the

      received notions of society and the sentimental literature of the day

      alone against all the writers and readers of novels to suggest this

      enquiry would not the younger part of the world be ready to take off its

      coat and run at him might and main republic yet if like

      peisthetaerus in aristophanes he could persuade the birds to hear him

      retiring a little behind a rampart not of pots and dishes but of

      unreadable books he might have something to say for himself might he not

      argue that a rational being should not follow the dictates of passion in

      the most important act of his or her life who would willingly enter into

      a contract at first sight almost without thought against the advice and

      opinion of his friends at a time when he acknowledges that he is not in

      his right mind and yet they are praised by the authors of romances who

      reject the warnings of their friends or parents rather than those who

      listen to them in such matters two inexperienced persons ignorant of the

      world and of one another how can they be said to choosethey draw

      lots whence also the saying marriage is a lottery then he would

      describe their way of life after marriage how they monopolize one

      anothers affections to the exclusion of friends and relations how they

      pass their days in unmeaning fondness or trivial conversation how the

      inferior of the two drags the other down to his or her level how the

      cares of a family breed meanness in their souls in the fulfilment of

      military or public duties they are not helpers but hinderers of one

      another they cannot undertake any noble enterprise such as makes the

      names of men and women famous from domestic considerations too late

      their eyes are opened they were taken unawares and desire to part

      company better he would say a little love at the beginning for

      heaven might have increased it but now their foolish fondness has changed

      into mutual dislike in the days of their honeymoon they never understood

      that they must provide against offences that they must have interests

      that they must learn the art of living as well as loving our misogamist

      will not appeal to anacreon or sappho for a confirmation of his view but

      to the universal experience of mankind how much nobler in conclusion he

      will say is friendship which does not receive unmeaning praises from

      novelists and poets is not exacting or exclusive is not impaired by

      familiarity is much less expensive is not so likely to take offence

      seldom changes and may be dissolved from time to time without the

      assistance of the courts besides he will remark that there is a much

      greater choice of friends than of wivesyou may have more of them

      and they will be far more improving to your mind they will not keep you

      dawdling at home or dancing attendance upon them or withdraw you from

      the great world and stirring scenes of life and action which would make a

      man of you

    


      in such a manner turning the seamy side outwards a modern socrates might

      describe the evils of married and domestic life they are evils which

      mankind in general have agreed to conceal partly because they are

      compensated by greater goods socrates or archilochus would soon have to

      sing a palinode for the injustice done to lovely helen or some misfortune

      worse than blindness might be fall them then they would take up their

      parable again and saythat there were two loves a higher and a

      lower holy and unholy a love of the mind and a love of the body

    


     let me not to the marriage of true minds

     admit impediments  love is not love

     which alters when it alteration finds



               



     loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks

     within his bending sickles compass come

     love alters not with his brief hours and weeks

     but bears it out even to the edge of doom




      but this true love of the mind cannot exist between two souls until they

      are purified from the grossness of earthly passion they must pass through

      a time of trial and conflict first in the language of religion they must

      be converted or born again then they would see the world transformed into

      a scene of heavenly beauty a divine idea would accompany them in all

      their thoughts and actions something too of the recollections of

      childhood might float about them still they might regain that old

      simplicity which had been theirs in other days at their first entrance on

      life and although their love of one another was ever present to them

      they would acknowledge also a higher love of duty and of god which united

      them and their happiness would depend upon their preserving in them this

      principlenot losing the ideals of justice and holiness and truth

      but renewing them at the fountain of light when they have attained to

      this exalted state let them marry something too may be conceded to the

      animal nature of man or live together in holy and innocent friendship

      the poet might describe in eloquent words the nature of such a union how

      after many struggles the true love was found how the two passed their

      lives together in the service of god and man how their characters were

      reflected upon one another and seemed to grow more like year by year how

      they read in one anothers eyes the thoughts wishes actions of the

      other how they saw each other in god how in a figure they grew wings

      like doves and were ready to fly away together and be at rest and

      lastly he might tell how after a time at no long intervals first one

      and then the other fell asleep and appeared to the unwise to die but

      were reunited in another state of being in which they saw justice and

      holiness and truth not according to the imperfect copies of them which

      are found in this world but justice absolute in existence absolute and

      so of the rest and they would hold converse not only with each other but

      with blessed souls everywhere and would be employed in the service of

      god every soul fulfilling his own nature and character and would see

      into the wonders of earth and heaven and trace the works of creation to

      their author

    


      so partly in jest but also with a certain degree of seriousness we may

      appropriate to ourselves the words of plato the use of such a parody

      though very imperfect is to transfer his thoughts to our sphere of

      religion and feeling to bring him nearer to us and us to him like the

      scriptures plato admits of endless applications if we allow for the

      difference of times and manners and we lose the better half of him when

      we regard his dialogues merely as literary compositions any ancient work

      which is worth reading has a practical and speculative as well as a

      literary interest and in plato more than in any other greek writer the

      local and transitory is inextricably blended with what is spiritual and

      eternal socrates is necessarily ironical for he has to withdraw from the

      received opinions and beliefs of mankind we cannot separate the

      transitory from the permanent nor can we translate the language of irony

      into that of plain reflection and common sense but we can imagine the

      mind of socrates in another age and country and we can interpret him by

      analogy with reference to the errors and prejudices which prevail among

      ourselves to return to the phaedrus

    


      both speeches are strongly condemned by socrates as sinful and blasphemous

      towards the god love and as worthy only of some haunt of sailors to which

      good manners were unknown the meaning of this and other wild language to

      the same effect which is introduced by way of contrast to the formality

      of the two speeches socrates has a sense of relief when he has escaped

      from the trammels of rhetoric seems to be that the two speeches proceed

      upon the supposition that love is and ought to be interested and that no

      such thing as a real or disinterested passion which would be at the same

      time lasting could be conceived but did i call this love o god

      forgive my blasphemy this is not love rather it is the love of the

      world but there is another kingdom of love a kingdom not of this world

      divine eternal and this other love i will now show you in a mystery

    


      then follows the famous myth which is a sort of parable and like other

      parables ought not to receive too minute an interpretation in all such

      allegories there is a great deal which is merely ornamental and the

      interpreter has to separate the important from the unimportant socrates

      himself has given the right clue when in using his own discourse

      afterwards as the text for his examination of rhetoric he characterizes

      it as a partly true and tolerably credible mythus in which amid

      poetical figures order and arrangement were not forgotten

    


      the soul is described in magnificent language as the selfmoved and the

      source of motion in all other things this is the philosophical theme or

      proem of the whole but ideas must be given through something and under

      the pretext that to realize the true nature of the soul would be not only

      tedious but impossible we at once pass on to describe the souls of gods

      as well as men under the figure of two winged steeds and a charioteer no

      connection is traced between the soul as the great motive power and the

      triple soul which is thus imaged there is no difficulty in seeing that

      the charioteer represents the reason or that the black horse is the

      symbol of the sensual or concupiscent element of human nature the white

      horse also represents rational impulse but the description a lover of

      honour and modesty and temperance and a follower of true glory though

      similar does not at once recall the spirit thumos of the republic

      the two steeds really correspond in a figure more nearly to the appetitive

      and moral or semirational soul of aristotle and thus for the first time

      perhaps in the history of philosophy we have represented to us the

      threefold division of psychology the image of the charioteer and the

      steeds has been compared with a similar image which occurs in the verses

      of parmenides but it is important to remark that the horses of parmenides

      have no allegorical meaning and that the poet is only describing his own

      approach in a chariot to the regions of light and the house of the goddess

      of truth

    


      the triple soul has had a previous existence in which following in the

      train of some god from whom she derived her character she beheld

      partially and imperfectly the vision of absolute truth all her after

      existence passed in many forms of men and animals is spent in regaining

      this the stages of the conflict are many and various and she is sorely

      let and hindered by the animal desires of the inferior or concupiscent

      steed again and again she beholds the flashing beauty of the beloved but

      before that vision can be finally enjoyed the animal desires must be

      subjected

    


      the moral or spiritual element in man is represented by the immortal steed

      which like thumos in the republic always sides with the reason both are

      dragged out of their course by the furious impulses of desire in the end

      something is conceded to the desires after they have been finally humbled

      and overpowered and yet the way of philosophy or perfect love of the

      unseen is total abstinence from bodily delights but all men cannot

      receive this saying in the lower life of ambition they may be taken off

      their guard and stoop to folly unawares and then although they do not

      attain to the highest bliss yet if they have once conquered they may be

      happy enough

    


      the language of the meno and the phaedo as well as of the phaedrus seems

      to show that at one time of his life plato was quite serious in

      maintaining a former state of existence his mission was to realize the

      abstract in that all good and truth all the hopes of this and another

      life seemed to centre to him abstractions as we call them were another

      kind of knowledgean inner and unseen world which seemed to exist

      far more truly than the fleeting objects of sense which were without him

      when we are once able to imagine the intense power which abstract ideas

      exercised over the mind of plato we see that there was no more difficulty

      to him in realizing the eternal existence of them and of the human minds

      which were associated with them in the past and future than in the

      present the difficulty was not how they could exist but how they could

      fail to exist in the attempt to regain this saving knowledge of the

      ideas the sense was found to be as great an enemy as the desires and

      hence two things which to us seem quite distinct are inextricably blended

      in the representation of plato

    


      thus far we may believe that plato was serious in his conception of the

      soul as a motive power in his reminiscence of a former state of being in

      his elevation of the reason over sense and passion and perhaps in his

      doctrine of transmigration was he equally serious in the rest for

      example are we to attribute his tripartite division of the soul to the

      gods or is this merely assigned to them by way of parallelism with men

      the latter is the more probable for the horses of the gods are both

      white ie their every impulse is in harmony with reason their dualism

      on the other hand only carries out the figure of the chariot is he

      serious again in regarding love as a madness that seems to arise out

      of the antithesis to the former conception of love at the same time he

      appears to intimate here as in the ion apology meno and elsewhere

      that there is a faculty in man whether to be termed in modern language

      genius or inspiration or imagination or idealism or communion with

      god which cannot be reduced to rule and measure perhaps too he is

      ironically repeating the common language of mankind about philosophy and

      is turning their jest into a sort of earnest compare phaedo symp or

      is he serious in holding that each soul bears the character of a god he

      may have had no other account to give of the differences of human

      characters to which he afterwards refers or again in his absurd

      derivation of mantike and oionistike and imeros compare cratylus it is

      characteristic of the irony of socrates to mix up sense and nonsense in

      such a way that no exact line can be drawn between them and allegory

      helps to increase this sort of confusion

    


      as is often the case in the parables and prophecies of scripture the

      meaning is allowed to break through the figure and the details are not

      always consistent when the charioteers and their steeds stand upon the

      dome of heaven they behold the intangible invisible essences which are not

      objects of sight this is because the force of language can no further go

      nor can we dwell much on the circumstance that at the completion of ten

      thousand years all are to return to the place from whence they came

      because he represents their return as dependent on their own good conduct

      in the successive stages of existence nor again can we attribute anything

      to the accidental inference which would also follow that even a tyrant

      may live righteously in the condition of life to which fate has called him

      he aiblins might i dinna ken but to suppose this would be at

      variance with plato himself and with greek notions generally he is much

      more serious in distinguishing men from animals by their recognition of

      the universal which they have known in a former state and in denying that

      this gift of reason can ever be obliterated or lost in the language of

      some modern theologians he might be said to maintain the final

      perseverance of those who have entered on their pilgrims progress other

      intimations of a metaphysic or theology of the future may also be

      discerned in him  the moderate predestinarianism which here as in the

      republic acknowledges the element of chance in human life and yet

      asserts the freedom and responsibility of man  the recognition of a

      moral as well as an intellectual principle in man under the image of an

      immortal steed  the notion that the divine nature exists by the

      contemplation of ideas of virtue and justiceor in other words the

      assertion of the essentially moral nature of god  again there is the

      hint that human life is a life of aspiration only and that the true ideal

      is not to be found in art  there occurs the first trace of the

      distinction between necessary and contingent matter  the conception of

      the soul itself as the motive power and reason of the universe

    


      the conception of the philosopher or the philosopher and lover in one as

      a sort of madman may be compared with the republic and theaetetus in

      both of which the philosopher is regarded as a stranger and monster upon

      the earth the whole myth like the other myths of plato describes in a

      figure things which are beyond the range of human faculties or

      inaccessible to the knowledge of the age that philosophy should be

      represented as the inspiration of love is a conception that has already

      become familiar to us in the symposium and is the expression partly of

      platos enthusiasm for the idea and is also an indication of the real

      power exercised by the passion of friendship over the mind of the greek

      the master in the art of love knew that there was a mystery in these

      feelings and their associations and especially in the contrast of the

      sensible and permanent which is afforded by them and he sought to explain

      this as he explained universal ideas by a reference to a former state of

      existence the capriciousness of love is also derived by him from an

      attachment to some god in a former world the singular remark that the

      beloved is more affected than the lover at the final consummation of their

      love seems likewise to hint at a psychological truth

    


      it is difficult to exhaust the meanings of a work like the phaedrus which

      indicates so much more than it expresses and is full of inconsistencies

      and ambiguities which were not perceived by plato himself for example

      when he is speaking of the soul does he mean the human or the divine soul

      and are they both equally selfmoving and constructed on the same

      threefold principle we should certainly be disposed to reply that the

      selfmotive is to be attributed to god only and on the other hand that

      the appetitive and passionate elements have no place in his nature so we

      should infer from the reason of the thing but there is no indication in

      platos own writings that this was his meaning or again when he

      explains the different characters of men by referring them back to the

      nature of the god whom they served in a former state of existence we are

      inclined to ask whether he is serious is he not rather using a

      mythological figure here as elsewhere to draw a veil over things which

      are beyond the limits of mortal knowledge once more in speaking of

      beauty is he really thinking of some external form such as might have been

      expressed in the works of phidias or praxiteles and not rather of an

      imaginary beauty of a sort which extinguishes rather than stimulates

      vulgar lovea heavenly beauty like that which flashed from time to

      time before the eyes of dante or bunyan surely the latter but it would

      be idle to reconcile all the details of the passage it is a picture not

      a system and a picture which is for the greater part an allegory and an

      allegory which allows the meaning to come through the image of the

      charioteer and his steeds is placed side by side with the absolute forms

      of justice temperance and the like which are abstract ideas only and

      which are seen with the eye of the soul in her heavenly journey the first

      impression of such a passage in which no attempt is made to separate the

      substance from the form is far truer than an elaborate philosophical

      analysis

    


      it is too often forgotten that the whole of the second discourse of

      socrates is only an allegory or figure of speech for this reason it is

      unnecessary to enquire whether the love of which plato speaks is the love

      of men or of women it is really a general idea which includes both and

      in which the sensual element though not wholly eradicated is reduced to

      order and measure we must not attribute a meaning to every fanciful

      detail nor is there any need to call up revolting associations which as

      a matter of good taste should be banished and which were far enough away

      from the mind of plato these and similar passages should be interpreted

      by the laws nor is there anything in the symposium or in the charmides

      in reality inconsistent with the sterner rule which plato lays down in the

      laws at the same time it is not to be denied that love and philosophy are

      described by socrates in figures of speech which would not be used in

      christian times or that nameless vices were prevalent at athens and in

      other greek cities or that friendships between men were a more sacred

      tie and had a more important social and educational influence than among

      ourselves see note on symposium

    


      in the phaedrus as well as in the symposium there are two kinds of love

      a lower and a higher the one answering to the natural wants of the

      animal the other rising above them and contemplating with religious awe

      the forms of justice temperance holiness yet finding them also too

      dazzling bright for mortal eye and shrinking from them in amazement the

      opposition between these two kinds of love may be compared to the

      opposition between the flesh and the spirit in the epistles of st paul

      it would be unmeaning to suppose that plato in describing the spiritual

      combat in which the rational soul is finally victor and master of both

      the steeds condescends to allow any indulgence of unnatural lusts

    


      two other thoughts about love are suggested by this passage first of all

      love is represented here as in the symposium as one of the great powers

      of nature which takes many forms and two principal ones having a

      predominant influence over the lives of men and these two though

      opposed are not absolutely separated the one from the other plato with

      his great knowledge of human nature was well aware how easily one is

      transformed into the other or how soon the noble but fleeting aspiration

      may return into the nature of the animal while the lower instinct which

      is latent always remains the intermediate sentimentalism which has

      exercised so great an influence on the literature of modern europe had no

      place in the classical times of hellas the higher love of which plato

      speaks is the subject not of poetry or fiction but of philosophy

    


      secondly there seems to be indicated a natural yearning of the human mind

      that the great ideas of justice temperance wisdom should be expressed

      in some form of visible beauty like the absolute purity and goodness

      which christian art has sought to realize in the person of the madonna

      but although human nature has often attempted to represent outwardly what

      can be only spiritually discerned men feel that in pictures and images

      whether painted or carved or described in words only we have not the

      substance but the shadow of the truth which is in heaven there is no

      reason to suppose that in the fairest works of greek art plato ever

      conceived himself to behold an image however faint of ideal truths not

      in that way was wisdom seen

    


      we may now pass on to the second part of the dialogue which is a

      criticism on the first rhetoric is assailed on various grounds first as

      desiring to persuade without a knowledge of the truth and secondly as

      ignoring the distinction between certain and probable matter the three

      speeches are then passed in review the first of them has no definition of

      the nature of love and no order in the topics being in these respects

      far inferior to the second while the third of them is found though a

      fancy of the hour to be framed upon real dialectical principles but

      dialectic is not rhetoric nothing on that subject is to be found in the

      endless treatises of rhetoric however prolific in hard names when plato

      has sufficiently put them to the test of ridicule he touches as with the

      point of a needle the real error which is the confusion of preliminary

      knowledge with creative power no attainments will provide the speaker

      with genius and the sort of attainments which can alone be of any value

      are the higher philosophy and the power of psychological analysis which

      is given by dialectic but not by the rules of the rhetoricians

    


      in this latter portion of the dialogue there are many texts which may help

      us to speak and to think the names dialectic and rhetoric are passing out

      of use we hardly examine seriously into their nature and limits and

      probably the arts both of speaking and of conversation have been unduly

      neglected by us but the mind of socrates pierces through the differences

      of times and countries into the essential nature of man and his words

      apply equally to the modern world and to the athenians of old would he

      not have asked of us or rather is he not asking of us whether we have

      ceased to prefer appearances to reality let us take a survey of the

      professions to which he refers and try them by his standard is not all

      literature passing into criticism just as athenian literature in the age

      of plato was degenerating into sophistry and rhetoric we can discourse

      and write about poems and paintings but we seem to have lost the gift of

      creating them can we wonder that few of them come sweetly from nature

      while ten thousand reviewers mala murioi are engaged in dissecting them

      young men like phaedrus are enamoured of their own literary clique and

      have but a feeble sympathy with the masterminds of former ages they

      recognize a poetical necessity in the writings of their favourite author

      even when he boldly wrote off just what came in his head they are

      beginning to think that art is enough just at the time when art is about

      to disappear from the world and would not a great painter such as

      michael angelo or a great poet such as shakespeare returning to earth

      courteously rebuke uswould he not say that we are putting in the

      place of art the preliminaries of art confusing art the expression of

      mind and truth with art the composition of colours and forms and perhaps

      he might more severely chastise some of us for trying to invent a new

      shudder instead of bringing to the birth living and healthy creations

      these he would regard as the signs of an age wanting in original power

    


      turning from literature and the arts to law and politics again we fall

      under the lash of socrates for do we not often make the worse appear the

      better cause and do not both parties sometimes agree to tell lies is

      not pleading an art of speaking unconnected with the truth there is

      another text of socrates which must not be forgotten in relation to this

      subject in the endless maze of english law is there any dividing the

      whole into parts or reuniting the parts into a wholeany semblance

      of an organized being having hands and feet and other members instead

      of a system there is the chaos of anaxagoras omou panta chremata and no

      mind or order then again in the noble art of politics who thinks of

      first principles and of true ideas we avowedly follow not the truth but

      the will of the many compare republic is not legislation too a sort of

      literary effort and might not statesmanship be described as the art of

      enchanting the house while there are some politicians who have no

      knowledge of the truth but only of what is likely to be approved by the

      many who sit in judgment there are others who can give no form to their

      ideal neither having learned the art of persuasion nor having any

      insight into the characters of men once more has not medical science

      become a professional routine which many practise without being able to

      say who were their instructorsthe application of a few drugs taken

      from a book instead of a lifelong study of the natures and constitutions

      of human beings do we see as clearly as hippocrates that the nature of

      the body can only be understood as a whole compare charm and are not

      they held to be the wisest physicians who have the greatest distrust of

      their art what would socrates think of our newspapers of our theology

      perhaps he would be afraid to speak of themthe one vox populi the

      other vox dei he might hesitate to attack them or he might trace a

      fanciful connexion between them and ask doubtfully whether they are not

      equally inspired he would remark that we are always searching for a

      belief and deploring our unbelief seeming to prefer popular opinions

      unverified and contradictory to unpopular truths which are assured to us

      by the most certain proofs that our preachers are in the habit of

      praising god without regard to truth and falsehood attributing to him

      every species of greatness and glory saying that he is all this and the

      cause of all that in order that we may exhibit him as the fairest and

      best of all symp without any consideration of his real nature and

      character or of the laws by which he governs the worldseeking for a

      private judgment and not for the truth or gods judgment what would

      he say of the church which we praise in like manner meaning ourselves

      without regard to history or experience might he not ask whether we

      care more for the truth of religion or for the speaker and the country

      from which the truth comes or whether the select wise are not the

      many after all symp so we may fill up the sketch of socrates lest

      as phaedrus says the argument should be too abstract and barren of

      illustrations compare symp apol euthyphro

    


      he next proceeds with enthusiasm to define the royal art of dialectic as

      the power of dividing a whole into parts and of uniting the parts in a

      whole and which may also be regarded compare soph as the process of

      the mind talking with herself the latter view has probably led plato to

      the paradox that speech is superior to writing in which he may seem also

      to be doing an injustice to himself for the two cannot be fairly compared

      in the manner which plato suggests the contrast of the living and dead

      word and the example of socrates which he has represented in the form of

      the dialogue seem to have misled him for speech and writing have really

      different functions the one is more transitory more diffuse more

      elastic and capable of adaptation to moods and times the other is more

      permanent more concentrated and is uttered not to this or that person or

      audience but to all the world in the politicus the paradox is carried

      further the mind or will of the king is preferred to the written law he

      is supposed to be the law personified the ideal made life

    


      yet in both these statements there is also contained a truth they may be

      compared with one another and also with the other famous paradox that

      knowledge cannot be taught socrates means to say that what is truly

      written is written in the soul just as what is truly taught grows up in

      the soul from within and is not forced upon it from without when planted

      in a congenial soil the little seed becomes a tree and the birds of the

      air build their nests in the branches there is an echo of this in the

      prayer at the end of the dialogue give me beauty in the inward soul and

      may the inward and outward man be at one we may further compare the

      words of st paul written not on tables of stone but on fleshly tables

      of the heart and again ye are my epistles known and read of all men

      there may be a use in writing as a preservative against the forgetfulness

      of old age but to live is higher far to be ourselves the book or the

      epistle the truth embodied in a person the word made flesh something

      like this we may believe to have passed before platos mind when he

      affirmed that speech was superior to writing so in other ages weary of

      literature and criticism of making many books of writing articles in

      reviews some have desired to live more closely in communion with their

      fellowmen to speak heart to heart to speak and act only and not to

      write following the example of socrates and of christ

    


      some other touches of inimitable grace and art and of the deepest wisdom

      may be also noted such as the prayer or collect which has just been

      cited give me beauty etc or the great name which belongs to god

      alone or the saying of wiser men than ourselves that a man of sense

      should try to please not his fellowservants but his good and noble

      masters like st paul again or the description of the heavenly

      originals

    


      the chief criteria for determining the date of the dialogue are  the

      ages of lysias and isocrates  the character of the work

    


      lysias was born in the year  isocrates in the year  about seven

      years before the birth of plato the first of the two great rhetoricians

      is described as in the zenith of his fame the second is still young and

      full of promise now it is argued that this must have been written in the

      youth of isocrates when the promise was not yet fulfilled and thus we

      should have to assign the dialogue to a year not later than  when

      isocrates was thirty and plato twentythree years of age and while

      socrates himself was still alive

    


      those who argue in this way seem not to reflect how easily plato can

      invent egyptians or anything else and how careless he is of historical

      truth or probability who would suspect that the wise critias the

      virtuous charmides had ended their lives among the thirty tyrants who

      would imagine that lysias who is here assailed by socrates is the son of

      his old friend cephalus or that isocrates himself is the enemy of plato

      and his school no arguments can be drawn from the appropriateness or

      inappropriateness of the characters of plato else perhaps it might be

      further argued that judging from their extant remains insipid rhetoric

      is far more characteristic of isocrates than of lysias but plato makes

      use of names which have often hardly any connection with the historical

      characters to whom they belong in this instance the comparative favour

      shown to isocrates may possibly be accounted for by the circumstance of

      his belonging to the aristocratical as lysias to the democratical party

    


      few persons will be inclined to suppose in the superficial manner of some

      ancient critics that a dialogue which treats of love must necessarily

      have been written in youth as little weight can be attached to the

      argument that plato must have visited egypt before he wrote the story of

      theuth and thamus for there is no real proof that he ever went to egypt

      and even if he did he might have known or invented egyptian traditions

      before he went there the late date of the phaedrus will have to be

      established by other arguments than these the maturity of the thought

      the perfection of the style the insight the relation to the other

      platonic dialogues seem to contradict the notion that it could have been

      the work of a youth of twenty or twentythree years of age the

      cosmological notion of the mind as the primum mobile and the admission of

      impulse into the immortal nature also afford grounds for assigning a

      later date compare tim soph laws add to this that the picture of

      socrates though in some lesser particularseg his going without

      sandals his habit of remaining within the walls his emphatic declaration

      that his study is human naturean exact resemblance is in the main

      the platonic and not the real socrates can we suppose the young man to

      have told such lies about his master while he was still alive moreover

      when two dialogues are so closely connected as the phaedrus and symposium

      there is great improbability in supposing that one of them was written at

      least twenty years after the other the conclusion seems to be that the

      dialogue was written at some comparatively late but unknown period of

      platos life after he had deserted the purely socratic point of view but

      before he had entered on the more abstract speculations of the sophist or

      the philebus taking into account the divisions of the soul the doctrine

      of transmigration the contemplative nature of the philosophic life and

      the character of the style we shall not be far wrong in placing the

      phaedrus in the neighbourhood of the republic remarking only that

      allowance must be made for the poetical element in the phaedrus which

      while falling short of the republic in definite philosophic results seems

      to have glimpses of a truth beyond

    


      two short passages which are unconnected with the main subject of the

      dialogue may seem to merit a more particular notice  the locus

      classicus about mythology  the tale of the grasshoppers

    


      the first passage is remarkable as showing that plato was entirely free

      from what may be termed the euhemerism of his age for there were

      euhemerists in hellas long before euhemerus early philosophers like

      anaxagoras and metrodorus had found in homer and mythology hidden

      meanings plato with a truer instinct rejects these attractive

      interpretations he regards the inventor of them as unfortunate and

      they draw a man off from the knowledge of himself there is a latent

      criticism and also a poetical sense in plato which enable him to discard

      them and yet in another way to make use of poetry and mythology as a

      vehicle of thought and feeling what would he have said of the discovery

      of christian doctrines in these old greek legends while acknowledging

      that such interpretations are very nice would he not have remarked that

      they are found in all sacred literatures they cannot be tested by any

      criterion of truth or used to establish any truth they add nothing to

      the sum of human knowledge they arewhat we please and if employed

      as peacemakers between the new and old are liable to serious

      misconstruction as he elsewhere remarks republic and therefore he

      would have bid farewell to them the study of them would take up too much

      of his time and he has not as yet learned the true nature of religion

      the sophistical interest of phaedrus the little touch about the two

      versions of the story the ironical manner in which these explanations are

      set asidethe common opinion about them is enough for methe

      allusion to the serpent typho may be noted in passing also the general

      agreement between the tone of this speech and the remark of socrates which

      follows afterwards i am a diviner but a poor one

    


      the tale of the grasshoppers is naturally suggested by the surrounding

      scene they are also the representatives of the athenians as children of

      the soil under the image of the lively chirruping grasshoppers who inform

      the muses in heaven about those who honour them on earth plato intends to

      represent an athenian audience tettigessin eoikotes the story is

      introduced apparently to mark a change of subject and also like

      several other allusions which occur in the course of the dialogue in

      order to preserve the scene in the recollection of the reader

    



      no one can duly appreciate the dialogues of plato especially the

      phaedrus symposium and portions of the republic who has not a sympathy

      with mysticism to the uninitiated as he would himself have acknowledged

      they will appear to be the dreams of a poet who is disguised as a

      philosopher there is a twofold difficulty in apprehending this aspect of

      the platonic writings first we do not immediately realize that under the

      marble exterior of greek literature was concealed a soul thrilling with

      spiritual emotion secondly the forms or figures which the platonic

      philosophy assumes are not like the images of the prophet isaiah or of

      the apocalypse familiar to us in the days of our youth by mysticism we

      mean not the extravagance of an erring fancy but the concentration of

      reason in feeling the enthusiastic love of the good the true the one

      the sense of the infinity of knowledge and of the marvel of the human

      faculties when feeding upon such thoughts the wing of the soul is

      renewed and gains strength she is raised above the manikins of earth

      and their opinions waiting in wonder to know and working with reverence

      to find out what god in this or in another life may reveal to her

    


      on the decline of greek literature

    


      one of the main purposes of plato in the phaedrus is to satirize rhetoric

      or rather the professors of rhetoric who swarmed at athens in the fourth

      century before christ as in the opening of the dialogue he ridicules the

      interpreters of mythology as in the protagoras he mocks at the sophists

      as in the euthydemus he makes fun of the wordsplitting eristics as in

      the cratylus he ridicules the fancies of etymologers as in the meno and

      gorgias and some other dialogues he makes reflections and casts sly

      imputation upon the higher classes at athens so in the phaedrus chiefly

      in the latter part he aims his shafts at the rhetoricians the profession

      of rhetoric was the greatest and most popular in athens necessary to a

      mans salvation or at any rate to his attainment of wealth or power but

      plato finds nothing wholesome or genuine in the purpose of it it is a

      veritable sham having no relation to fact or to truth of any kind it

      is antipathetic to him not only as a philosopher but also as a great

      writer he cannot abide the tricks of the rhetoricians or the pedantries

      and mannerisms which they introduce into speech and writing he sees

      clearly how far removed they are from the ways of simplicity and truth

      and how ignorant of the very elements of the art which they are professing

      to teach the thing which is most necessary of all the knowledge of human

      nature is hardly if at all considered by them the true rules of

      composition which are very few are not to be found in their voluminous

      systems their pretentiousness their omniscience their large fortunes

      their impatience of argument their indifference to first principles

      their stupidity their progresses through hellas accompanied by a troop of

      their disciplesthese things were very distasteful to plato who

      esteemed genius far above art and was quite sensible of the interval

      which separated them phaedrus it is the interval which separates

      sophists and rhetoricians from ancient famous men and women such as homer

      and hesiod anacreon and sappho aeschylus and sophocles and the platonic

      socrates is afraid that if he approves the former he will be disowned by

      the latter the spirit of rhetoric was soon to overspread all hellas and

      plato with prophetic insight may have seen from afar the great literary

      waste or dead level or interminable marsh in which greek literature was

      soon to disappear a similar vision of the decline of the greek drama and

      of the contrast of the old literature and the new was present to the mind

      of aristophanes after the death of the three great tragedians frogs

      after about a hundred or at most two hundred years if we exclude homer

      the genius of hellas had ceased to flower or blossom the dreary waste

      which follows beginning with the alexandrian writers and even before them

      in the platitudes of isocrates and his school spreads over much more than

      a thousand years and from this decline the greek language and literature

      unlike the latin which has come to life in new forms and been developed

      into the great european languages never recovered

    


      this monotony of literature without merit without genius and without

      character is a phenomenon which deserves more attention than it has

      hitherto received it is a phenomenon unique in the literary history of

      the world how could there have been so much cultivation so much

      diligence in writing and so little mind or real creative power why did a

      thousand years invent nothing better than sibylline books orphic poems

      byzantine imitations of classical histories christian reproductions of

      greek plays novels like the silly and obscene romances of longus and

      heliodorus innumerable forged epistles a great many epigrams

      biographies of the meanest and most meagre description a sham philosophy

      which was the bastard progeny of the union between hellas and the east

      only in plutarch in lucian in longinus in the roman emperors marcus

      aurelius and julian in some of the christian fathers are there any traces

      of good sense or originality or any power of arousing the interest of

      later ages and when new books ceased to be written why did hosts of

      grammarians and interpreters flock in who never attain to any sound

      notion either of grammar or interpretation why did the physical sciences

      never arrive at any true knowledge or make any real progress why did

      poetry droop and languish why did history degenerate into fable why did

      words lose their power of expression why were ages of external greatness

      and magnificence attended by all the signs of decay in the human mind

      which are possible

    


      to these questions many answers may be given which if not the true

      causes are at least to be reckoned among the symptoms of the decline

      there is the want of method in physical science the want of criticism in

      history the want of simplicity or delicacy in poetry the want of

      political freedom which is the true atmosphere of public speaking in

      oratory the ways of life were luxurious and commonplace philosophy had

      become extravagant eclectic abstract devoid of any real content at

      length it ceased to exist it had spread words like plaster over the whole

      field of knowledge it had grown ascetic on one side mystical on the

      other neither of these tendencies was favourable to literature there was

      no sense of beauty either in language or in art the greek world became

      vacant barbaric oriental no one had anything new to say or any

      conviction of truth the age had no remembrance of the past no power of

      understanding what other ages thought and felt the catholic faith had

      degenerated into dogma and controversy for more than a thousand years not

      a single writer of firstrate or even of secondrate reputation has a

      place in the innumerable rolls of greek literature

    


      if we seek to go deeper we can still only describe the outward nature of

      the clouds or darkness which were spread over the heavens during so many

      ages without relief or light we may say that this like several other

      long periods in the history of the human race was destitute or deprived

      of the moral qualities which are the root of literary excellence it had

      no life or aspiration no national or political force no desire for

      consistency no love of knowledge for its own sake it did not attempt to

      pierce the mists which surrounded it it did not propose to itself to go

      forward and scale the heights of knowledge but to go backwards and seek

      at the beginning what can only be found towards the end it was lost in

      doubt and ignorance it rested upon tradition and authority it had none

      of the higher play of fancy which creates poetry and where there is no

      true poetry neither can there be any good prose it had no great

      characters and therefore it had no great writers it was incapable of

      distinguishing between words and things it was so hopelessly below the

      ancient standard of classical greek art and literature that it had no

      power of understanding or of valuing them it is doubtful whether any

      greek author was justly appreciated in antiquity except by his own

      contemporaries and this neglect of the great authors of the past led to

      the disappearance of the larger part of them while the greek fathers were

      mostly preserved there is no reason to suppose that in the century

      before the taking of constantinople much more was in existence than the

      scholars of the renaissance carried away with them to italy

    


      the character of greek literature sank lower as time went on it consisted

      more and more of compilations of scholia of extracts of commentaries

      forgeries imitations the commentator or interpreter had no conception of

      his author as a whole and very little of the context of any passage which

      he was explaining the least things were preferred by him to the greatest

      the question of a reading or a grammatical form or an accent or the

      uses of a word took the place of the aim or subject of the book he had

      no sense of the beauties of an author and very little light is thrown by

      him on real difficulties he interprets past ages by his own the greatest

      classical writers are the least appreciated by him this seems to be the

      reason why so many of them have perished why the lyric poets have almost

      wholly disappeared why out of the eighty or ninety tragedies of

      aeschylus and sophocles only seven of each had been preserved

    


      such an age of sciolism and scholasticism may possibly once more get the

      better of the literary world there are those who prophesy that the signs

      of such a day are again appearing among us and that at the end of the

      present century no writer of the first class will be still alive they

      think that the muse of literature may transfer herself to other countries

      less dried up or worn out than our own they seem to see the withering

      effect of criticism on original genius no one can doubt that such a decay

      or decline of literature and of art seriously affects the manners and

      character of a nation it takes away half the joys and refinements of

      life it increases its dulness and grossness hence it becomes a matter of

      great interest to consider how if at all such a degeneracy may be

      averted is there any elixir which can restore life and youth to the

      literature of a nation or at any rate which can prevent it becoming

      unmanned and enfeebled

    


      first there is the progress of education it is possible and even

      probable that the extension of the means of knowledge over a wider area

      and to persons living under new conditions may lead to many new

      combinations of thought and language but as yet experience does not

      favour the realization of such a hope or promise it may be truly answered

      that at present the training of teachers and the methods of education are

      very imperfect and therefore that we cannot judge of the future by the

      present when more of our youth are trained in the best literatures and

      in the best parts of them their minds may be expected to have a larger

      growth they will have more interests more thoughts more material for

      conversation they will have a higher standard and begin to think for

      themselves the number of persons who will have the opportunity of

      receiving the highest education through the cheap press and by the help

      of high schools and colleges may increase tenfold it is likely that in

      every thousand persons there is at least one who is far above the average

      in natural capacity but the seed which is in him dies for want of

      cultivation it has never had any stimulus to grow or any field in which

      to blossom and produce fruit here is a great reservoir or treasurehouse

      of human intelligence out of which new waters may flow and cover the

      earth if at any time the great men of the world should die out and

      originality or genius appear to suffer a partial eclipse there is a

      boundless hope in the multitude of intelligences for future generations

      they may bring gifts to men such as the world has never received before

      they may begin at a higher point and yet take with them all the results of

      the past the cooperation of many may have effects not less striking

      though different in character from those which the creative genius of a

      single man such as bacon or newton formerly produced there is also

      great hope to be derived not merely from the extension of education over

      a wider area but from the continuance of it during many generations

      educated parents will have children fit to receive education and these

      again will grow up under circumstances far more favourable to the growth

      of intelligence than any which have hitherto existed in our own or in

      former ages

    


      even if we were to suppose no more men of genius to be produced the great

      writers of ancient or of modern times will remain to furnish abundant

      materials of education to the coming generation now that every nation

      holds communication with every other we may truly say in a fuller sense

      than formerly that the thoughts of men are widened with the process of

      the suns they will not be cribbed cabined and confined within a

      province or an island the east will provide elements of culture to the

      west as well as the west to the east the religions and literatures of the

      world will be open books which he who wills may read the human race may

      not be always ground down by bodily toil but may have greater leisure for

      the improvement of the mind the increasing sense of the greatness and

      infinity of nature will tend to awaken in men larger and more liberal

      thoughts the love of mankind may be the source of a greater development

      of literature than nationality has ever been there may be a greater

      freedom from prejudice and party we may better understand the whereabouts

      of truth and therefore there may be more success and fewer failures in

      the search for it lastly in the coming ages we shall carry with us the

      recollection of the past in which are necessarily contained many seeds of

      revival and renaissance in the future so far is the world from becoming

      exhausted so groundless is the fear that literature will ever die out

    


 






      phaedrus

    


      persons of the dialogue socrates phaedrus

    


      scene under a planetree by the banks of the ilissus

    


      socrates my dear phaedrus whence come you and whither are you going

    


      phaedrus i come from lysias the son of cephalus and i am going to take a

      walk outside the wall for i have been sitting with him the whole morning

      and our common friend acumenus tells me that it is much more refreshing to

      walk in the open air than to be shut up in a cloister

    


      socrates there he is right lysias then i suppose was in the town

    


      phaedrus yes he was staying with epicrates here at the house of

      morychus that house which is near the temple of olympian zeus

    


      socrates and how did he entertain you can i be wrong in supposing that

      lysias gave you a feast of discourse

    


      phaedrus you shall hear if you can spare time to accompany me

    


      socrates and should i not deem the conversation of you and lysias a

      thing of higher import as i may say in the words of pindar than any

      business

    


      phaedrus will you go on

    


      socrates and will you go on with the narration

    


      phaedrus my tale socrates is one of your sort for love was the theme

      which occupied uslove after a fashion lysias has been writing

      about a fair youth who was being tempted but not by a lover and this was

      the point he ingeniously proved that the nonlover should be accepted

      rather than the lover

    


      socrates o that is noble of him i wish that he would say the poor man

      rather than the rich and the old man rather than the young onethen

      he would meet the case of me and of many a man his words would be quite

      refreshing and he would be a public benefactor for my part i do so long

      to hear his speech that if you walk all the way to megara and when you

      have reached the wall come back as herodicus recommends without going

      in i will keep you company

    


      phaedrus what do you mean my good socrates how can you imagine that my

      unpractised memory can do justice to an elaborate work which the greatest

      rhetorician of the age spent a long time in composing indeed i cannot i

      would give a great deal if i could

    


      socrates i believe that i know phaedrus about as well as i know myself

      and i am very sure that the speech of lysias was repeated to him not once

      only but again and againhe insisted on hearing it many times over

      and lysias was very willing to gratify him at last when nothing else

      would do he got hold of the book and looked at what he most wanted to

      seethis occupied him during the whole morningand then when

      he was tired with sitting he went out to take a walk not until by the

      dog as i believe he had simply learned by heart the entire discourse

      unless it was unusually long and he went to a place outside the wall that

      he might practise his lesson there he saw a certain lover of discourse

      who had a similar weaknesshe saw and rejoiced now thought he i

      shall have a partner in my revels and he invited him to come and walk

      with him but when the lover of discourse begged that he would repeat the

      tale he gave himself airs and said no i cannot as if he were

      indisposed although if the hearer had refused he would sooner or later

      have been compelled by him to listen whether he would or no therefore

      phaedrus bid him do at once what he will soon do whether bidden or not

    


      phaedrus i see that you will not let me off until i speak in some fashion

      or other verily therefore my best plan is to speak as i best can

    


      socrates a very true remark that of yours

    


      phaedrus i will do as i say but believe me socrates i did not learn

      the very wordso no nevertheless i have a general notion of what he

      said and will give you a summary of the points in which the lover

      differed from the nonlover let me begin at the beginning

    


      socrates yes my sweet one but you must first of all show what you have

      in your left hand under your cloak for that roll as i suspect is the

      actual discourse now much as i love you i would not have you suppose

      that i am going to have your memory exercised at my expense if you have

      lysias himself here

    


      phaedrus enough i see that i have no hope of practising my art upon you

      but if i am to read where would you please to sit

    


      socrates let us turn aside and go by the ilissus we will sit down at

      some quiet spot

    


      phaedrus i am fortunate in not having my sandals and as you never have

      any i think that we may go along the brook and cool our feet in the

      water this will be the easiest way and at midday and in the summer is

      far from being unpleasant

    


      socrates lead on and look out for a place in which we can sit down

    


      phaedrus do you see the tallest planetree in the distance

    


      socrates yes

    


      phaedrus there are shade and gentle breezes and grass on which we may

      either sit or lie down

    


      socrates move forward

    


      phaedrus i should like to know socrates whether the place is not

      somewhere here at which boreas is said to have carried off orithyia from

      the banks of the ilissus

    


      socrates such is the tradition

    


      phaedrus and is this the exact spot the little stream is delightfully

      clear and bright i can fancy that there might be maidens playing near

    


      socrates i believe that the spot is not exactly here but about a quarter

      of a mile lower down where you cross to the temple of artemis and there

      is i think some sort of an altar of boreas at the place

    


      phaedrus i have never noticed it but i beseech you to tell me socrates

      do you believe this tale

    


      socrates the wise are doubtful and i should not be singular if like

      them i too doubted i might have a rational explanation that orithyia was

      playing with pharmacia when a northern gust carried her over the

      neighbouring rocks and this being the manner of her death she was said

      to have been carried away by boreas there is a discrepancy however

      about the locality according to another version of the story she was

      taken from areopagus and not from this place now i quite acknowledge

      that these allegories are very nice but he is not to be envied who has to

      invent them much labour and ingenuity will be required of him and when

      he has once begun he must go on and rehabilitate hippocentaurs and

      chimeras dire gorgons and winged steeds flow in apace and numberless

      other inconceivable and portentous natures and if he is sceptical about

      them and would fain reduce them one after another to the rules of

      probability this sort of crude philosophy will take up a great deal of

      time now i have no leisure for such enquiries shall i tell you why i

      must first know myself as the delphian inscription says to be curious

      about that which is not my concern while i am still in ignorance of my

      own self would be ridiculous and therefore i bid farewell to all this

      the common opinion is enough for me for as i was saying i want to know

      not about this but about myself am i a monster more complicated and

      swollen with passion than the serpent typho or a creature of a gentler

      and simpler sort to whom nature has given a diviner and lowlier destiny

      but let me ask you friend have we not reached the planetree to which

      you were conducting us

    


      phaedrus yes this is the tree

    


      socrates by here a fair restingplace full of summer sounds and scents

      here is this lofty and spreading planetree and the agnus castus high and

      clustering in the fullest blossom and the greatest fragrance and the

      stream which flows beneath the planetree is deliciously cold to the feet

      judging from the ornaments and images this must be a spot sacred to

      achelous and the nymphs how delightful is the breezeso very

      sweet and there is a sound in the air shrill and summerlike which makes

      answer to the chorus of the cicadae but the greatest charm of all is the

      grass like a pillow gently sloping to the head my dear phaedrus you

      have been an admirable guide

    


      phaedrus what an incomprehensible being you are socrates when you are

      in the country as you say you really are like some stranger who is led

      about by a guide do you ever cross the border i rather think that you

      never venture even outside the gates

    


      socrates very true my good friend and i hope that you will excuse me

      when you hear the reason which is that i am a lover of knowledge and

      the men who dwell in the city are my teachers and not the trees or the

      country though i do indeed believe that you have found a spell with which

      to draw me out of the city into the country like a hungry cow before whom

      a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved for only hold up before me in like

      manner a book and you may lead me all round attica and over the wide

      world and now having arrived i intend to lie down and do you choose any

      posture in which you can read best begin

    


      phaedrus listen you know how matters stand with me and how as i

      conceive this affair may be arranged for the advantage of both of us and

      i maintain that i ought not to fail in my suit because i am not your

      lover for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown when

      their passion ceases but to the nonlovers who are free and not under any

      compulsion no time of repentance ever comes for they confer their

      benefits according to the measure of their ability in the way which is

      most conducive to their own interest then again lovers consider how by

      reason of their love they have neglected their own concerns and rendered

      service to others and when to these benefits conferred they add on the

      troubles which they have endured they think that they have long ago made

      to the beloved a very ample return but the nonlover has no such

      tormenting recollections he has never neglected his affairs or quarrelled

      with his relations he has no troubles to add up or excuses to invent and

      being well rid of all these evils why should he not freely do what will

      gratify the beloved if you say that the lover is more to be esteemed

      because his love is thought to be greater for he is willing to say and do

      what is hateful to other men in order to please his belovedthat

      if true is only a proof that he will prefer any future love to his

      present and will injure his old love at the pleasure of the new and how

      in a matter of such infinite importance can a man be right in trusting

      himself to one who is afflicted with a malady which no experienced person

      would attempt to cure for the patient himself admits that he is not in

      his right mind and acknowledges that he is wrong in his mind but says

      that he is unable to control himself and if he came to his right mind

      would he ever imagine that the desires were good which he conceived when

      in his wrong mind once more there are many more nonlovers than lovers

      and if you choose the best of the lovers you will not have many to choose

      from but if from the nonlovers the choice will be larger and you will

      be far more likely to find among them a person who is worthy of your

      friendship if public opinion be your dread and you would avoid reproach

      in all probability the lover who is always thinking that other men are as

      emulous of him as he is of them will boast to some one of his successes

      and make a show of them openly in the pride of his hearthe wants

      others to know that his labour has not been lost but the nonlover is

      more his own master and is desirous of solid good and not of the opinion

      of mankind again the lover may be generally noted or seen following the

      beloved this is his regular occupation and whenever they are observed

      to exchange two words they are supposed to meet about some affair of love

      either past or in contemplation but when nonlovers meet no one asks the

      reason why because people know that talking to another is natural

      whether friendship or mere pleasure be the motive once more if you fear

      the fickleness of friendship consider that in any other case a quarrel

      might be a mutual calamity but now when you have given up what is most

      precious to you you will be the greater loser and therefore you will

      have more reason in being afraid of the lover for his vexations are many

      and he is always fancying that every one is leagued against him wherefore

      also he debars his beloved from society he will not have you intimate

      with the wealthy lest they should exceed him in wealth or with men of

      education lest they should be his superiors in understanding and he is

      equally afraid of anybodys influence who has any other advantage over

      himself if he can persuade you to break with them you are left without a

      friend in the world or if out of a regard to your own interest you have

      more sense than to comply with his desire you will have to quarrel with

      him but those who are nonlovers and whose success in love is the reward

      of their merit will not be jealous of the companions of their beloved

      and will rather hate those who refuse to be his associates thinking that

      their favourite is slighted by the latter and benefited by the former for

      more love than hatred may be expected to come to him out of his friendship

      with others many lovers too have loved the person of a youth before they

      knew his character or his belongings so that when their passion has

      passed away there is no knowing whether they will continue to be his

      friends whereas in the case of nonlovers who were always friends the

      friendship is not lessened by the favours granted but the recollection of

      these remains with them and is an earnest of good things to come

    


      further i say that you are likely to be improved by me whereas the lover

      will spoil you for they praise your words and actions in a wrong way

      partly because they are afraid of offending you and also their judgment

      is weakened by passion such are the feats which love exhibits he makes

      things painful to the disappointed which give no pain to others he

      compels the successful lover to praise what ought not to give him

      pleasure and therefore the beloved is to be pitied rather than envied

      but if you listen to me in the first place i in my intercourse with

      you shall not merely regard present enjoyment but also future advantage

      being not mastered by love but my own master nor for small causes taking

      violent dislikes but even when the cause is great slowly laying up

      little wrathunintentional offences i shall forgive and intentional

      ones i shall try to prevent and these are the marks of a friendship which

      will last

    


      do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend reflectif

      this were true we should set small value on sons or fathers or mothers

      nor should we ever have loyal friends for our love of them arises not

      from passion but from other associations further if we ought to shower

      favours on those who are the most eager suitorson that principle

      we ought always to do good not to the most virtuous but to the most

      needy for they are the persons who will be most relieved and will

      therefore be the most grateful and when you make a feast you should

      invite not your friend but the beggar and the empty soul for they will

      love you and attend you and come about your doors and will be the best

      pleased and the most grateful and will invoke many a blessing on your

      head yet surely you ought not to be granting favours to those who besiege

      you with prayer but to those who are best able to reward you nor to the

      lover only but to those who are worthy of love nor to those who will

      enjoy the bloom of your youth but to those who will share their

      possessions with you in age nor to those who having succeeded will

      glory in their success to others but to those who will be modest and tell

      no tales nor to those who care about you for a moment only but to those

      who will continue your friends through life nor to those who when their

      passion is over will pick a quarrel with you but rather to those who

      when the charm of youth has left you will show their own virtue remember

      what i have said and consider yet this further point friends admonish

      the lover under the idea that his way of life is bad but no one of his

      kindred ever yet censured the nonlover or thought that he was

      illadvised about his own interests

    


      perhaps you will ask me whether i propose that you should indulge every

      nonlover to which i reply that not even the lover would advise you to

      indulge all lovers for the indiscriminate favour is less esteemed by the

      rational recipient and less easily hidden by him who would escape the

      censure of the world now love ought to be for the advantage of both

      parties and for the injury of neither

    


      i believe that i have said enough but if there is anything more which

      you desire or which in your opinion needs to be supplied ask and i will

      answer

    


      now socrates what do you think is not the discourse excellent more

      especially in the matter of the language

    


      socrates yes quite admirable the effect on me was ravishing and this i

      owe to you phaedrus for i observed you while reading to be in an

      ecstasy and thinking that you are more experienced in these matters than

      i am i followed your example and like you my divine darling i became

      inspired with a phrenzy

    


      phaedrus indeed you are pleased to be merry

    


      socrates do you mean that i am not in earnest

    


      phaedrus now dont talk in that way socrates but let me have your real

      opinion i adjure you by zeus the god of friendship to tell me whether

      you think that any hellene could have said more or spoken better on the

      same subject

    


      socrates well but are you and i expected to praise the sentiments of the

      author or only the clearness and roundness and finish and tournure of

      the language as to the first i willingly submit to your better judgment

      for i am not worthy to form an opinion having only attended to the

      rhetorical manner and i was doubting whether this could have been

      defended even by lysias himself i thought though i speak under

      correction that he repeated himself two or three times either from want

      of words or from want of pains and also he appeared to me ostentatiously

      to exult in showing how well he could say the same thing in two or three

      ways

    


      phaedrus nonsense socrates what you call repetition was the especial

      merit of the speech for he omitted no topic of which the subject rightly

      allowed and i do not think that any one could have spoken better or more

      exhaustively

    


      socrates there i cannot go along with you ancient sages men and women

      who have spoken and written of these things would rise up in judgment

      against me if out of complaisance i assented to you

    


      phaedrus who are they and where did you hear anything better than this

    


      socrates i am sure that i must have heard but at this moment i do not

      remember from whom perhaps from sappho the fair or anacreon the wise

      or possibly from a prose writer why do i say so why because i

      perceive that my bosom is full and that i could make another speech as

      good as that of lysias and different now i am certain that this is not

      an invention of my own who am well aware that i know nothing and

      therefore i can only infer that i have been filled through the ears like

      a pitcher from the waters of another though i have actually forgotten in

      my stupidity who was my informant

    


      phaedrus that is grandbut never mind where you heard the

      discourse or from whom let that be a mystery not to be divulged even at

      my earnest desire only as you say promise to make another and better

      oration equal in length and entirely new on the same subject and i

      like the nine archons will promise to set up a golden image at delphi

      not only of myself but of you and as large as life

    


      socrates you are a dear golden ass if you suppose me to mean that lysias

      has altogether missed the mark and that i can make a speech from which

      all his arguments are to be excluded the worst of authors will say

      something which is to the point who for example could speak on this

      thesis of yours without praising the discretion of the nonlover and

      blaming the indiscretion of the lover these are the commonplaces of the

      subject which must come in for what else is there to be said and must

      be allowed and excused the only merit is in the arrangement of them for

      there can be none in the invention but when you leave the commonplaces

      then there may be some originality

    


      phaedrus i admit that there is reason in what you say and i too will be

      reasonable and will allow you to start with the premiss that the lover is

      more disordered in his wits than the nonlover if in what remains you

      make a longer and better speech than lysias and use other arguments then

      i say again that a statue you shall have of beaten gold and take your

      place by the colossal offerings of the cypselids at olympia

    


      socrates how profoundly in earnest is the lover because to tease him i

      lay a finger upon his love and so phaedrus you really imagine that i am

      going to improve upon the ingenuity of lysias

    


      phaedrus there i have you as you had me and you must just speak as you

      best can do not let us exchange tu quoque as in a farce or compel me

      to say to you as you said to me i know socrates as well as i know

      myself and he was wanting to speak but he gave himself airs rather i

      would have you consider that from this place we stir not until you have

      unbosomed yourself of the speech for here are we all alone and i am

      stronger remember and younger than youwherefore perpend and do

      not compel me to use violence

    


      socrates but my sweet phaedrus how ridiculous it would be of me to

      compete with lysias in an extempore speech he is a master in his art and

      i am an untaught man

    


      phaedrus you see how matters stand and therefore let there be no more

      pretences for indeed i know the word that is irresistible

    


      socrates then dont say it

    


      phaedrus yes but i will and my word shall be an oath i say or rather

      swearbut what god will be witness of my oathby this

      planetree i swear that unless you repeat the discourse here in the face

      of this very planetree i will never tell you another never let you have

      word of another

    


      socrates villain i am conquered the poor lover of discourse has no more

      to say

    


      phaedrus then why are you still at your tricks

    


      socrates i am not going to play tricks now that you have taken the oath

      for i cannot allow myself to be starved

    


      phaedrus proceed

    


      socrates shall i tell you what i will do

    


      phaedrus what

    


      socrates i will veil my face and gallop through the discourse as fast as

      i can for if i see you i shall feel ashamed and not know what to say

    


      phaedrus only go on and you may do anything else which you please

    


      socrates come o ye muses melodious as ye are called whether you have

      received this name from the character of your strains or because the

      melians are a musical race help o help me in the tale which my good

      friend here desires me to rehearse in order that his friend whom he

      always deemed wise may seem to him to be wiser than ever

    


      once upon a time there was a fair boy or more properly speaking a

      youth he was very fair and had a great many lovers and there was one

      special cunning one who had persuaded the youth that he did not love him

      but he really loved him all the same and one day when he was paying his

      addresses to him he used this very argumentthat he ought to accept

      the nonlover rather than the lover his words were as follows

    


      all good counsel begins in the same way a man should know what he is

      advising about or his counsel will all come to nought but people imagine

      that they know about the nature of things when they dont know about

      them and not having come to an understanding at first because they think

      that they know they end as might be expected in contradicting one

      another and themselves now you and i must not be guilty of this

      fundamental error which we condemn in others but as our question is

      whether the lover or nonlover is to be preferred let us first of all

      agree in defining the nature and power of love and then keeping our eyes

      upon the definition and to this appealing let us further enquire whether

      love brings advantage or disadvantage

    


      every one sees that love is a desire and we know also that nonlovers

      desire the beautiful and good now in what way is the lover to be

      distinguished from the nonlover let us note that in every one of us

      there are two guiding and ruling principles which lead us whither they

      will one is the natural desire of pleasure the other is an acquired

      opinion which aspires after the best and these two are sometimes in

      harmony and then again at war and sometimes the one sometimes the other

      conquers when opinion by the help of reason leads us to the best the

      conquering principle is called temperance but when desire which is

      devoid of reason rules in us and drags us to pleasure that power of

      misrule is called excess now excess has many names and many members and

      many forms and any of these forms when very marked gives a name neither

      honourable nor creditable to the bearer of the name the desire of

      eating for example which gets the better of the higher reason and the

      other desires is called gluttony and he who is possessed by it is called

      a glutton the tyrannical desire of drink which inclines the possessor of

      the desire to drink has a name which is only too obvious and there can

      be as little doubt by what name any other appetite of the same family

      would be calledit will be the name of that which happens to be

      dominant and now i think that you will perceive the drift of my

      discourse but as every spoken word is in a manner plainer than the

      unspoken i had better say further that the irrational desire which

      overcomes the tendency of opinion towards right and is led away to the

      enjoyment of beauty and especially of personal beauty by the desires

      which are her own kindredthat supreme desire i say which by

      leading conquers and by the force of passion is reinforced from this very

      force receiving a name is called love erromenos eros

    


      and now dear phaedrus i shall pause for an instant to ask whether you do

      not think me as i appear to myself inspired

    


      phaedrus yes socrates you seem to have a very unusual flow of words

    


      socrates listen to me then in silence for surely the place is holy so

      that you must not wonder if as i proceed i appear to be in a divine

      fury for already i am getting into dithyrambics

    


      phaedrus nothing can be truer

    


      socrates the responsibility rests with you but hear what follows and

      perhaps the fit may be averted all is in their hands above i will go on

      talking to my youth listen

    


      thus my friend we have declared and defined the nature of the subject

      keeping the definition in view let us now enquire what advantage or

      disadvantage is likely to ensue from the lover or the nonlover to him who

      accepts their advances

    


      he who is the victim of his passions and the slave of pleasure will of

      course desire to make his beloved as agreeable to himself as possible now

      to him who has a mind diseased anything is agreeable which is not opposed

      to him but that which is equal or superior is hateful to him and

      therefore the lover will not brook any superiority or equality on the part

      of his beloved he is always employed in reducing him to inferiority and

      the ignorant is the inferior of the wise the coward of the brave the

      slow of speech of the speaker the dull of the clever these and not

      these only are the mental defects of the beloveddefects which

      when implanted by nature are necessarily a delight to the lover and when

      not implanted he must contrive to implant them in him if he would not be

      deprived of his fleeting joy and therefore he cannot help being jealous

      and will debar his beloved from the advantages of society which would make

      a man of him and especially from that society which would have given him

      wisdom and thereby he cannot fail to do him great harm that is to say

      in his excessive fear lest he should come to be despised in his eyes he

      will be compelled to banish from him divine philosophy and there is no

      greater injury which he can inflict upon him than this he will contrive

      that his beloved shall be wholly ignorant and in everything shall look to

      him he is to be the delight of the lovers heart and a curse to himself

      verily a lover is a profitable guardian and associate for him in all that

      relates to his mind

    


      let us next see how his master whose law of life is pleasure and not

      good will keep and train the body of his servant will he not choose a

      beloved who is delicate rather than sturdy and strong one brought up in

      shady bowers and not in the bright sun a stranger to manly exercises and

      the sweat of toil accustomed only to a soft and luxurious diet instead

      of the hues of health having the colours of paint and ornament and the

      rest of a piecesuch a life as any one can imagine and which i need

      not detail at length but i may sum up all that i have to say in a word

      and pass on such a person in war or in any of the great crises of life

      will be the anxiety of his friends and also of his lover and certainly

      not the terror of his enemies which nobody can deny

    


      and now let us tell what advantage or disadvantage the beloved will

      receive from the guardianship and society of his lover in the matter of

      his property this is the next point to be considered the lover will be

      the first to see what indeed will be sufficiently evident to all men

      that he desires above all things to deprive his beloved of his dearest and

      best and holiest possessions father mother kindred friends of all

      whom he thinks may be hinderers or reprovers of their most sweet converse

      he will even cast a jealous eye upon his gold and silver or other

      property because these make him a less easy prey and when caught less

      manageable hence he is of necessity displeased at his possession of them

      and rejoices at their loss and he would like him to be wifeless

      childless homeless as well and the longer the better for the longer he

      is all this the longer he will enjoy him

    


      there are some sort of animals such as flatterers who are dangerous and

      mischievous enough and yet nature has mingled a temporary pleasure and

      grace in their composition you may say that a courtesan is hurtful and

      disapprove of such creatures and their practices and yet for the time

      they are very pleasant but the lover is not only hurtful to his love he

      is also an extremely disagreeable companion the old proverb says that

      birds of a feather flock together i suppose that equality of years

      inclines them to the same pleasures and similarity begets friendship yet

      you may have more than enough even of this and verily constraint is

      always said to be grievous now the lover is not only unlike his beloved

      but he forces himself upon him for he is old and his love is young and

      neither day nor night will he leave him if he can help necessity and the

      sting of desire drive him on and allure him with the pleasure which he

      receives from seeing hearing touching perceiving him in every way and

      therefore he is delighted to fasten upon him and to minister to him but

      what pleasure or consolation can the beloved be receiving all this time

      must he not feel the extremity of disgust when he looks at an old

      shrivelled face and the remainder to match which even in a description is

      disagreeable and quite detestable when he is forced into daily contact

      with his lover moreover he is jealously watched and guarded against

      everything and everybody and has to hear misplaced and exaggerated

      praises of himself and censures equally inappropriate which are

      intolerable when the man is sober and besides being intolerable are

      published all over the world in all their indelicacy and wearisomeness

      when he is drunk

    


      and not only while his love continues is he mischievous and unpleasant

      but when his love ceases he becomes a perfidious enemy of him on whom he

      showered his oaths and prayers and promises and yet could hardly prevail

      upon him to tolerate the tedium of his company even from motives of

      interest the hour of payment arrives and now he is the servant of

      another master instead of love and infatuation wisdom and temperance are

      his bosoms lords but the beloved has not discovered the change which has

      taken place in him when he asks for a return and recalls to his

      recollection former sayings and doings he believes himself to be speaking

      to the same person and the other not having the courage to confess the

      truth and not knowing how to fulfil the oaths and promises which he made

      when under the dominion of folly and having now grown wise and temperate

      does not want to do as he did or to be as he was before and so he runs

      away and is constrained to be a defaulter the oystershell in allusion

      to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an

      oystershell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light

      side uppermost has fallen with the other side uppermosthe changes

      pursuit into flight while the other is compelled to follow him with

      passion and imprecation not knowing that he ought never from the first to

      have accepted a demented lover instead of a sensible nonlover and that

      in making such a choice he was giving himself up to a faithless morose

      envious disagreeable being hurtful to his estate hurtful to his bodily

      health and still more hurtful to the cultivation of his mind than which

      there neither is nor ever will be anything more honoured in the eyes both

      of gods and men consider this fair youth and know that in the

      friendship of the lover there is no real kindness he has an appetite and

      wants to feed upon you

    


      as wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves

    


      but i told you so i am speaking in verse and therefore i had better make

      an end enough

    


      phaedrus i thought that you were only halfway and were going to make a

      similar speech about all the advantages of accepting the nonlover why do

      you not proceed

    


      socrates does not your simplicity observe that i have got out of

      dithyrambics into heroics when only uttering a censure on the lover and

      if i am to add the praises of the nonlover what will become of me do you

      not perceive that i am already overtaken by the nymphs to whom you have

      mischievously exposed me and therefore i will only add that the nonlover

      has all the advantages in which the lover is accused of being deficient

      and now i will say no more there has been enough of both of them leaving

      the tale to its fate i will cross the river and make the best of my way

      home lest a worse thing be inflicted upon me by you

    


      phaedrus not yet socrates not until the heat of the day has passed do

      you not see that the hour is almost noon there is the midday sun standing

      still as people say in the meridian let us rather stay and talk over

      what has been said and then return in the cool

    


      socrates your love of discourse phaedrus is superhuman simply

      marvellous and i do not believe that there is any one of your

      contemporaries who has either made or in one way or another has compelled

      others to make an equal number of speeches i would except simmias the

      theban but all the rest are far behind you and now i do verily believe

      that you have been the cause of another

    


      phaedrus that is good news but what do you mean

    


      socrates i mean to say that as i was about to cross the stream the usual

      sign was given to methat sign which always forbids but never

      bids me to do anything which i am going to do and i thought that i heard

      a voice saying in my ear that i had been guilty of impiety and that i

      must not go away until i had made an atonement now i am a diviner though

      not a very good one but i have enough religion for my own use as you

      might say of a bad writerhis writing is good enough for him and i

      am beginning to see that i was in error o my friend how prophetic is the

      human soul at the time i had a sort of misgiving and like ibycus i

      was troubled i feared that i might be buying honour from men at the price

      of sinning against the gods now i recognize my error

    


      phaedrus what error

    


      socrates that was a dreadful speech which you brought with you and you

      made me utter one as bad

    


      phaedrus how so

    


      socrates it was foolish i sayto a certain extent impious can

      anything be more dreadful

    


      phaedrus nothing if the speech was really such as you describe

    


      socrates well and is not eros the son of aphrodite and a god

    


      phaedrus so men say

    


      socrates but that was not acknowledged by lysias in his speech nor by

      you in that other speech which you by a charm drew from my lips for if

      love be as he surely is a divinity he cannot be evil yet this was the

      error of both the speeches there was also a simplicity about them which

      was refreshing having no truth or honesty in them nevertheless they

      pretended to be something hoping to succeed in deceiving the manikins of

      earth and gain celebrity among them wherefore i must have a purgation

      and i bethink me of an ancient purgation of mythological error which was

      devised not by homer for he never had the wit to discover why he was

      blind but by stesichorus who was a philosopher and knew the reason why

      and therefore when he lost his eyes for that was the penalty which was

      inflicted upon him for reviling the lovely helen he at once purged

      himself and the purgation was a recantation which began thus

    


 false is that word of minethe truth is that thou didst not embark in

 ships nor ever go to the walls of troy




      and when he had completed his poem which is called the recantation

      immediately his sight returned to him now i will be wiser than either

      stesichorus or homer in that i am going to make my recantation for

      reviling love before i suffer and this i will attempt not as before

      veiled and ashamed but with forehead bold and bare

    


      phaedrus nothing could be more agreeable to me than to hear you say so

    


      socrates only think my good phaedrus what an utter want of delicacy was

      shown in the two discourses i mean in my own and in that which you

      recited out of the book would not any one who was himself of a noble and

      gentle nature and who loved or ever had loved a nature like his own when

      we tell of the petty causes of lovers jealousies and of their exceeding

      animosities and of the injuries which they do to their beloved have

      imagined that our ideas of love were taken from some haunt of sailors to

      which good manners were unknownhe would certainly never have

      admitted the justice of our censure

    


      phaedrus i dare say not socrates

    


      socrates therefore because i blush at the thought of this person and

      also because i am afraid of love himself i desire to wash the brine out

      of my ears with water from the spring and i would counsel lysias not to

      delay but to write another discourse which shall prove that ceteris

      paribus the lover ought to be accepted rather than the nonlover

    


      phaedrus be assured that he shall you shall speak the praises of the

      lover and lysias shall be compelled by me to write another discourse on

      the same theme

    


      socrates you will be true to your nature in that and therefore i believe

      you

    


      phaedrus speak and fear not

    


      socrates but where is the fair youth whom i was addressing before and

      who ought to listen now lest if he hear me not he should accept a

      nonlover before he knows what he is doing

    


      phaedrus he is close at hand and always at your service

    


      socrates know then fair youth that the former discourse was the word of

      phaedrus the son of vain man who dwells in the city of myrrhina

      myrrhinusius and this which i am about to utter is the recantation of

      stesichorus the son of godly man euphemus who comes from the town of

      desire himera and is to the following effect i told a lie when i

      said that the beloved ought to accept the nonlover when he might have

      the lover because the one is sane and the other mad it might be so if

      madness were simply an evil but there is also a madness which is a divine

      gift and the source of the chiefest blessings granted to men for

      prophecy is a madness and the prophetess at delphi and the priestesses at

      dodona when out of their senses have conferred great benefits on hellas

      both in public and private life but when in their senses few or none and

      i might also tell you how the sibyl and other inspired persons have given

      to many an one many an intimation of the future which has saved them from

      falling but it would be tedious to speak of what every one knows

    


      there will be more reason in appealing to the ancient inventors of names

      compare cratylus who would never have connected prophecy mantike

      which foretells the future and is the noblest of arts with madness

      manike or called them both by the same name if they had deemed madness

      to be a disgrace or dishonourthey must have thought that there was

      an inspired madness which was a noble thing for the two words mantike

      and manike are really the same and the letter tau is only a modern and

      tasteless insertion and this is confirmed by the name which was given by

      them to the rational investigation of futurity whether made by the help

      of birds or of other signsthis for as much as it is an art which

      supplies from the reasoning faculty mind nous and information istoria

      to human thought oiesis they originally termed oionoistike but the word

      has been lately altered and made sonorous by the modern introduction of

      the letter omega oionoistike and oionistike and in proportion as

      prophecy mantike is more perfect and august than augury both in name

      and fact in the same proportion as the ancients testify is madness

      superior to a sane mind sophrosune for the one is only of human but the

      other of divine origin again where plagues and mightiest woes have bred

      in certain families owing to some ancient bloodguiltiness there madness

      has entered with holy prayers and rites and by inspired utterances found

      a way of deliverance for those who are in need and he who has part in

      this gift and is truly possessed and duly out of his mind is by the use

      of purifications and mysteries made whole and exempt from evil future as

      well as present and has a release from the calamity which was afflicting

      him the third kind is the madness of those who are possessed by the

      muses which taking hold of a delicate and virgin soul and there

      inspiring frenzy awakens lyrical and all other numbers with these

      adorning the myriad actions of ancient heroes for the instruction of

      posterity but he who having no touch of the muses madness in his soul

      comes to the door and thinks that he will get into the temple by the help

      of arthe i say and his poetry are not admitted the sane man

      disappears and is nowhere when he enters into rivalry with the madman

    


      i might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired

      madness and therefore let no one frighten or flutter us by saying that

      the temperate friend is to be chosen rather than the inspired but let him

      further show that love is not sent by the gods for any good to lover or

      beloved if he can do so we will allow him to carry off the palm and we

      on our part will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is the

      greatest of heavens blessings and the proof shall be one which the wise

      will receive and the witling disbelieve but first of all let us view

      the affections and actions of the soul divine and human and try to

      ascertain the truth about them the beginning of our proof is as follows

    


      translated by cic tus quaest the soul through all her being is

      immortal for that which is ever in motion is immortal but that which

      moves another and is moved by another in ceasing to move ceases also to

      live only the selfmoving never leaving self never ceases to move and

      is the fountain and beginning of motion to all that moves besides now

      the beginning is unbegotten for that which is begotten has a beginning

      but the beginning is begotten of nothing for if it were begotten of

      something then the begotten would not come from a beginning but if

      unbegotten it must also be indestructible for if beginning were

      destroyed there could be no beginning out of anything nor anything out

      of a beginning and all things must have a beginning and therefore the

      selfmoving is the beginning of motion and this can neither be destroyed

      nor begotten else the whole heavens and all creation would collapse and

      stand still and never again have motion or birth but if the selfmoving

      is proved to be immortal he who affirms that selfmotion is the very idea

      and essence of the soul will not be put to confusion for the body which

      is moved from without is soulless but that which is moved from within has

      a soul for such is the nature of the soul but if this be true must not

      the soul be the selfmoving and therefore of necessity unbegotten and

      immortal enough of the souls immortality

    


      of the nature of the soul though her true form be ever a theme of large

      and more than mortal discourse let me speak briefly and in a figure and

      let the figure be compositea pair of winged horses and a

      charioteer now the winged horses and the charioteers of the gods are all

      of them noble and of noble descent but those of other races are mixed

      the human charioteer drives his in a pair and one of them is noble and of

      noble breed and the other is ignoble and of ignoble breed and the

      driving of them of necessity gives a great deal of trouble to him i will

      endeavour to explain to you in what way the mortal differs from the

      immortal creature the soul in her totality has the care of inanimate

      being everywhere and traverses the whole heaven in divers forms appearingwhen

      perfect and fully winged she soars upward and orders the whole world

      whereas the imperfect soul losing her wings and drooping in her flight at

      last settles on the solid groundthere finding a home she receives

      an earthly frame which appears to be selfmoved but is really moved by

      her power and this composition of soul and body is called a living and

      mortal creature for immortal no such union can be reasonably believed to

      be although fancy not having seen nor surely known the nature of god

      may imagine an immortal creature having both a body and also a soul which

      are united throughout all time let that however be as god wills and be

      spoken of acceptably to him and now let us ask the reason why the soul

      loses her wings

    


      the wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine and

      which by nature tends to soar aloft and carry that which gravitates

      downwards into the upper region which is the habitation of the gods the

      divine is beauty wisdom goodness and the like and by these the wing of

      the soul is nourished and grows apace but when fed upon evil and

      foulness and the opposite of good wastes and falls away zeus the mighty

      lord holding the reins of a winged chariot leads the way in heaven

      ordering all and taking care of all and there follows him the array of

      gods and demigods marshalled in eleven bands hestia alone abides at

      home in the house of heaven of the rest they who are reckoned among the

      princely twelve march in their appointed order they see many blessed

      sights in the inner heaven and there are many ways to and fro along

      which the blessed gods are passing every one doing his own work he may

      follow who will and can for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir

      but when they go to banquet and festival then they move up the steep to

      the top of the vault of heaven the chariots of the gods in even poise

      obeying the rein glide rapidly but the others labour for the vicious

      steed goes heavily weighing down the charioteer to the earth when his

      steed has not been thoroughly trainedand this is the hour of agony

      and extremest conflict for the soul for the immortals when they are at

      the end of their course go forth and stand upon the outside of heaven

      and the revolution of the spheres carries them round and they behold the

      things beyond but of the heaven which is above the heavens what earthly

      poet ever did or ever will sing worthily it is such as i will describe

      for i must dare to speak the truth when truth is my theme there abides

      the very being with which true knowledge is concerned the colourless

      formless intangible essence visible only to mind the pilot of the soul

      the divine intelligence being nurtured upon mind and pure knowledge and

      the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food

      proper to it rejoices at beholding reality and once more gazing upon

      truth is replenished and made glad until the revolution of the worlds

      brings her round again to the same place in the revolution she beholds

      justice and temperance and knowledge absolute not in the form of

      generation or of relation which men call existence but knowledge

      absolute in existence absolute and beholding the other true existences in

      like manner and feasting upon them she passes down into the interior of

      the heavens and returns home and there the charioteer putting up his

      horses at the stall gives them ambrosia to eat and nectar to drink

    


      such is the life of the gods but of other souls that which follows god

      best and is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer into the outer

      world and is carried round in the revolution troubled indeed by the

      steeds and with difficulty beholding true being while another only rises

      and falls and sees and again fails to see by reason of the unruliness of

      the steeds the rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world

      and they all follow but not being strong enough they are carried round

      below the surface plunging treading on one another each striving to be

      first and there is confusion and perspiration and the extremity of

      effort and many of them are lamed or have their wings broken through the

      illdriving of the charioteers and all of them after a fruitless toil

      not having attained to the mysteries of true being go away and feed upon

      opinion the reason why the souls exhibit this exceeding eagerness to

      behold the plain of truth is that pasturage is found there which is

      suited to the highest part of the soul and the wing on which the soul

      soars is nourished with this and there is a law of destiny that the soul

      which attains any vision of truth in company with a god is preserved from

      harm until the next period and if attaining always is always unharmed

      but when she is unable to follow and fails to behold the truth and

      through some illhap sinks beneath the double load of forgetfulness and

      vice and her wings fall from her and she drops to the ground then the

      law ordains that this soul shall at her first birth pass not into any

      other animal but only into man and the soul which has seen most of truth

      shall come to the birth as a philosopher or artist or some musical and

      loving nature that which has seen truth in the second degree shall be

      some righteous king or warrior chief the soul which is of the third class

      shall be a politician or economist or trader the fourth shall be a

      lover of gymnastic toils or a physician the fifth shall lead the life of

      a prophet or hierophant to the sixth the character of poet or some other

      imitative artist will be assigned to the seventh the life of an artisan

      or husbandman to the eighth that of a sophist or demagogue to the ninth

      that of a tyrantall these are states of probation in which he who

      does righteously improves and he who does unrighteously deteriorates his

      lot

    


      ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can return to

      the place from whence she came for she cannot grow her wings in less

      only the soul of a philosopher guileless and true or the soul of a

      lover who is not devoid of philosophy may acquire wings in the third of

      the recurring periods of a thousand years he is distinguished from the

      ordinary good man who gains wings in three thousand yearsand they

      who choose this life three times in succession have wings given them and

      go away at the end of three thousand years but the others the

      philosopher alone is not subject to judgment krisis for he has never

      lost the vision of truth receive judgment when they have completed their

      first life and after the judgment they go some of them to the houses of

      correction which are under the earth and are punished others to some

      place in heaven whither they are lightly borne by justice and there they

      live in a manner worthy of the life which they led here when in the form

      of men and at the end of the first thousand years the good souls and also

      the evil souls both come to draw lots and choose their second life and

      they may take any which they please the soul of a man may pass into the

      life of a beast or from the beast return again into the man but the soul

      which has never seen the truth will not pass into the human form for a

      man must have intelligence of universals and be able to proceed from the

      many particulars of sense to one conception of reasonthis is the

      recollection of those things which our soul once saw while following godwhen

      regardless of that which we now call being she raised her head up towards

      the true being and therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings

      and this is just for he is always according to the measure of his

      abilities clinging in recollection to those things in which god abides

      and in beholding which he is what he is and he who employs aright these

      memories is ever being initiated into perfect mysteries and alone becomes

      truly perfect but as he forgets earthly interests and is rapt in the

      divine the vulgar deem him mad and rebuke him they do not see that he

      is inspired

    


      thus far i have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness

      which is imputed to him who when he sees the beauty of earth is

      transported with the recollection of the true beauty he would like to fly

      away but he cannot he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward and

      careless of the world below and he is therefore thought to be mad and i

      have shown this of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest and the

      offspring of the highest to him who has or shares in it and that he who

      loves the beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of it for as

      has been already said every soul of man has in the way of nature beheld

      true being this was the condition of her passing into the form of man

      but all souls do not easily recall the things of the other world they may

      have seen them for a short time only or they may have been unfortunate in

      their earthly lot and having had their hearts turned to unrighteousness

      through some corrupting influence they may have lost the memory of the

      holy things which once they saw few only retain an adequate remembrance

      of them and they when they behold here any image of that other world

      are rapt in amazement but they are ignorant of what this rapture means

      because they do not clearly perceive for there is no light of justice or

      temperance or any of the higher ideas which are precious to souls in the

      earthly copies of them they are seen through a glass dimly and there are

      few who going to the images behold in them the realities and these only

      with difficulty there was a time when with the rest of the happy band

      they saw beauty shining in brightnesswe philosophers following in

      the train of zeus others in company with other gods and then we beheld

      the beatific vision and were initiated into a mystery which may be truly

      called most blessed celebrated by us in our state of innocence before we

      had any experience of evils to come when we were admitted to the sight of

      apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy which we beheld

      shining in pure light pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that living

      tomb which we carry about now that we are imprisoned in the body like an

      oyster in his shell let me linger over the memory of scenes which have

      passed away

    


      but of beauty i repeat again that we saw her there shining in company

      with the celestial forms and coming to earth we find her here too

      shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense for sight is

      the most piercing of our bodily senses though not by that is wisdom seen

      her loveliness would have been transporting if there had been a visible

      image of her and the other ideas if they had visible counterparts would

      be equally lovely but this is the privilege of beauty that being the

      loveliest she is also the most palpable to sight now he who is not newly

      initiated or who has become corrupted does not easily rise out of this

      world to the sight of true beauty in the other he looks only at her

      earthly namesake and instead of being awed at the sight of her he is

      given over to pleasure and like a brutish beast he rushes on to enjoy and

      beget he consorts with wantonness and is not afraid or ashamed of

      pursuing pleasure in violation of nature but he whose initiation is

      recent and who has been the spectator of many glories in the other world

      is amazed when he sees any one having a godlike face or form which is the

      expression of divine beauty and at first a shudder runs through him and

      again the old awe steals over him then looking upon the face of his

      beloved as of a god he reverences him and if he were not afraid of being

      thought a downright madman he would sacrifice to his beloved as to the

      image of a god then while he gazes on him there is a sort of reaction

      and the shudder passes into an unusual heat and perspiration for as he

      receives the effluence of beauty through the eyes the wing moistens and

      he warms and as he warms the parts out of which the wing grew and which

      had been hitherto closed and rigid and had prevented the wing from

      shooting forth are melted and as nourishment streams upon him the lower

      end of the wing begins to swell and grow from the root upwards and the

      growth extends under the whole soulfor once the whole was winged

      during this process the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition and

      effervescencewhich may be compared to the irritation and

      uneasiness in the gums at the time of cutting teethbubbles up and

      has a feeling of uneasiness and tickling but when in like manner the soul

      is beginning to grow wings the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and

      she receives the sensible warm motion of particles which flow towards her

      therefore called emotion imeros and is refreshed and warmed by them

      and then she ceases from her pain with joy but when she is parted from

      her beloved and her moisture fails then the orifices of the passage out

      of which the wing shoots dry up and close and intercept the germ of the

      wing which being shut up with the emotion throbbing as with the

      pulsations of an artery pricks the aperture which is nearest until at

      length the entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained and at the

      recollection of beauty is again delighted and from both of them together

      the soul is oppressed at the strangeness of her condition and is in a

      great strait and excitement and in her madness can neither sleep by night

      nor abide in her place by day and wherever she thinks that she will

      behold the beautiful one thither in her desire she runs and when she has

      seen him and bathed herself in the waters of beauty her constraint is

      loosened and she is refreshed and has no more pangs and pains and this

      is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time and is the reason why the

      soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful one whom he esteems

      above all he has forgotten mother and brethren and companions and he

      thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property the rules and

      proprieties of life on which he formerly prided himself he now despises

      and is ready to sleep like a servant wherever he is allowed as near as

      he can to his desired one who is the object of his worship and the

      physician who can alone assuage the greatness of his pain and this state

      my dear imaginary youth to whom i am talking is by men called love and

      among the gods has a name at which you in your simplicity may be

      inclined to mock there are two lines in the apocryphal writings of homer

      in which the name occurs one of them is rather outrageous and not

      altogether metrical they are as follows

    


      mortals call him fluttering love but the immortals call him winged one

      because the growing of wings or reading pterothoiton the movement of

      wings is a necessity to him

    


      you may believe this but not unless you like at any rate the loves of

      lovers and their causes are such as i have described

    


      now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of zeus is better able to

      bear the winged god and can endure a heavier burden but the attendants

      and companions of ares when under the influence of love if they fancy

      that they have been at all wronged are ready to kill and put an end to

      themselves and their beloved and he who follows in the train of any other

      god while he is unspoiled and the impression lasts honours and imitates

      him as far as he is able and after the manner of his god he behaves in

      his intercourse with his beloved and with the rest of the world during the

      first period of his earthly existence every one chooses his love from the

      ranks of beauty according to his character and this he makes his god and

      fashions and adorns as a sort of image which he is to fall down and

      worship the followers of zeus desire that their beloved should have a

      soul like him and therefore they seek out some one of a philosophical and

      imperial nature and when they have found him and loved him they do all

      they can to confirm such a nature in him and if they have no experience

      of such a disposition hitherto they learn of any one who can teach them

      and themselves follow in the same way and they have the less difficulty

      in finding the nature of their own god in themselves because they have

      been compelled to gaze intensely on him their recollection clings to him

      and they become possessed of him and receive from him their character and

      disposition so far as man can participate in god the qualities of their

      god they attribute to the beloved wherefore they love him all the more

      and if like the bacchic nymphs they draw inspiration from zeus they

      pour out their own fountain upon him wanting to make him as like as

      possible to their own god but those who are the followers of here seek a

      royal love and when they have found him they do just the same with him

      and in like manner the followers of apollo and of every other god walking

      in the ways of their god seek a love who is to be made like him whom they

      serve and when they have found him they themselves imitate their god

      and persuade their love to do the same and educate him into the manner

      and nature of the god as far as they each can for no feelings of envy or

      jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved but they do their

      utmost to create in him the greatest likeness of themselves and of the god

      whom they honour thus fair and blissful to the beloved is the desire of

      the inspired lover and the initiation of which i speak into the mysteries

      of true love if he be captured by the lover and their purpose is

      effected now the beloved is taken captive in the following manner

    


      as i said at the beginning of this tale i divided each soul into threetwo

      horses and a charioteer and one of the horses was good and the other bad

      the division may remain but i have not yet explained in what the goodness

      or badness of either consists and to that i will now proceed the

      righthand horse is upright and cleanly made he has a lofty neck and an

      aquiline nose his colour is white and his eyes dark he is a lover of

      honour and modesty and temperance and the follower of true glory he

      needs no touch of the whip but is guided by word and admonition only the

      other is a crooked lumbering animal put together anyhow he has a short

      thick neck he is flatfaced and of a dark colour with grey eyes and

      bloodred complexion or with grey and bloodshot eyes the mate of

      insolence and pride shageared and deaf hardly yielding to whip and

      spur now when the charioteer beholds the vision of love and has his

      whole soul warmed through sense and is full of the prickings and

      ticklings of desire the obedient steed then as always under the

      government of shame refrains from leaping on the beloved but the other

      heedless of the pricks and of the blows of the whip plunges and runs

      away giving all manner of trouble to his companion and the charioteer

      whom he forces to approach the beloved and to remember the joys of love

      they at first indignantly oppose him and will not be urged on to do

      terrible and unlawful deeds but at last when he persists in plaguing

      them they yield and agree to do as he bids them and now they are at the

      spot and behold the flashing beauty of the beloved which when the

      charioteer sees his memory is carried to the true beauty whom he beholds

      in company with modesty like an image placed upon a holy pedestal he sees

      her but he is afraid and falls backwards in adoration and by his fall is

      compelled to pull back the reins with such violence as to bring both the

      steeds on their haunches the one willing and unresisting the unruly one

      very unwilling and when they have gone back a little the one is overcome

      with shame and wonder and his whole soul is bathed in perspiration the

      other when the pain is over which the bridle and the fall had given him

      having with difficulty taken breath is full of wrath and reproaches

      which he heaps upon the charioteer and his fellowsteed for want of

      courage and manhood declaring that they have been false to their

      agreement and guilty of desertion again they refuse and again he urges

      them on and will scarce yield to their prayer that he would wait until

      another time when the appointed hour comes they make as if they had

      forgotten and he reminds them fighting and neighing and dragging them

      on until at length he on the same thoughts intent forces them to draw

      near again and when they are near he stoops his head and puts up his

      tail and takes the bit in his teeth and pulls shamelessly then the

      charioteer is worse off than ever he falls back like a racer at the

      barrier and with a still more violent wrench drags the bit out of the

      teeth of the wild steed and covers his abusive tongue and jaws with blood

      and forces his legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him sorely

      and when this has happened several times and the villain has ceased from

      his wanton way he is tamed and humbled and follows the will of the

      charioteer and when he sees the beautiful one he is ready to die of fear

      and from that time forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in

      modesty and holy fear

    


      and so the beloved who like a god has received every true and loyal

      service from his lover not in pretence but in reality being also himself

      of a nature friendly to his admirer if in former days he has blushed to

      own his passion and turned away his lover because his youthful companions

      or others slanderously told him that he would be disgraced now as years

      advance at the appointed age and time is led to receive him into

      communion for fate which has ordained that there shall be no friendship

      among the evil has also ordained that there shall ever be friendship among

      the good and the beloved when he has received him into communion and

      intimacy is quite amazed at the goodwill of the lover he recognises

      that the inspired friend is worth all other friends or kinsmen they have

      nothing of friendship in them worthy to be compared with his and when

      this feeling continues and he is nearer to him and embraces him in

      gymnastic exercises and at other times of meeting then the fountain of

      that stream which zeus when he was in love with ganymede named desire

      overflows upon the lover and some enters into his soul and some when he

      is filled flows out again and as a breeze or an echo rebounds from the

      smooth rocks and returns whence it came so does the stream of beauty

      passing through the eyes which are the windows of the soul come back to

      the beautiful one there arriving and quickening the passages of the

      wings watering them and inclining them to grow and filling the soul of

      the beloved also with love and thus he loves but he knows not what he

      does not understand and cannot explain his own state he appears to have

      caught the infection of blindness from another the lover is his mirror in

      whom he is beholding himself but he is not aware of this when he is with

      the lover both cease from their pain but when he is away then he longs

      as he is longed for and has loves image love for love anteros lodging

      in his breast which he calls and believes to be not love but friendship

      only and his desire is as the desire of the other but weaker he wants

      to see him touch him kiss him embrace him and probably not long

      afterwards his desire is accomplished when they meet the wanton steed of

      the lover has a word to say to the charioteer he would like to have a

      little pleasure in return for many pains but the wanton steed of the

      beloved says not a word for he is bursting with passion which he

      understands nothe throws his arms round the lover and embraces him

      as his dearest friend and when they are side by side he is not in a

      state in which he can refuse the lover anything if he ask him although

      his fellowsteed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments of shame

      and reason after this their happiness depends upon their selfcontrol if

      the better elements of the mind which lead to order and philosophy

      prevail then they pass their life here in happiness and harmonymasters

      of themselves and orderlyenslaving the vicious and emancipating the

      virtuous elements of the soul and when the end comes they are light and

      winged for flight having conquered in one of the three heavenly or truly

      olympian victories nor can human discipline or divine inspiration confer

      any greater blessing on man than this if on the other hand they leave

      philosophy and lead the lower life of ambition then probably after wine

      or in some other careless hour the two wanton animals take the two souls

      when off their guard and bring them together and they accomplish that

      desire of their hearts which to the many is bliss and this having once

      enjoyed they continue to enjoy yet rarely because they have not the

      approval of the whole soul they too are dear but not so dear to one

      another as the others either at the time of their love or afterwards

      they consider that they have given and taken from each other the most

      sacred pledges and they may not break them and fall into enmity at last

      they pass out of the body unwinged but eager to soar and thus obtain no

      mean reward of love and madness for those who have once begun the

      heavenward pilgrimage may not go down again to darkness and the journey

      beneath the earth but they live in light always happy companions in

      their pilgrimage and when the time comes at which they receive their

      wings they have the same plumage because of their love

    


      thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a lover will

      confer upon you my youth whereas the attachment of the nonlover which

      is alloyed with a worldly prudence and has worldly and niggardly ways of

      doling out benefits will breed in your soul those vulgar qualities which

      the populace applaud will send you bowling round the earth during a

      period of nine thousand years and leave you a fool in the world below

    


      and thus dear eros i have made and paid my recantation as well and as

      fairly as i could more especially in the matter of the poetical figures

      which i was compelled to use because phaedrus would have them and now

      forgive the past and accept the present and be gracious and merciful to

      me and do not in thine anger deprive me of sight or take from me the art

      of love which thou hast given me but grant that i may be yet more

      esteemed in the eyes of the fair and if phaedrus or i myself said

      anything rude in our first speeches blame lysias who is the father of

      the brat and let us have no more of his progeny bid him study

      philosophy like his brother polemarchus and then his lover phaedrus will

      no longer halt between two opinions but will dedicate himself wholly to

      love and to philosophical discourses

    


      phaedrus i join in the prayer socrates and say with you if this be for

      my good may your words come to pass but why did you make your second

      oration so much finer than the first i wonder why and i begin to be

      afraid that i shall lose conceit of lysias and that he will appear tame

      in comparison even if he be willing to put another as fine and as long as

      yours into the field which i doubt for quite lately one of your

      politicians was abusing him on this very account and called him a speech

      writer again and again so that a feeling of pride may probably induce

      him to give up writing speeches

    


      socrates what a very amusing notion but i think my young man that you

      are much mistaken in your friend if you imagine that he is frightened at a

      little noise and possibly you think that his assailant was in earnest

    


      phaedrus i thought socrates that he was and you are aware that the

      greatest and most influential statesmen are ashamed of writing speeches

      and leaving them in a written form lest they should be called sophists by

      posterity

    


      socrates you seem to be unconscious phaedrus that the sweet elbow a

      proverb like the grapes are sour applied to pleasures which cannot be

      had meaning sweet things which like the elbow are out of the reach of

      the mouth the promised pleasure turns out to be a long and tedious

      affair of the proverb is really the long arm of the nile and you appear

      to be equally unaware of the fact that this sweet elbow of theirs is also

      a long arm for there is nothing of which our great politicians are so

      fond as of writing speeches and bequeathing them to posterity and they

      add their admirers names at the top of the writing out of gratitude to

      them

    


      phaedrus what do you mean i do not understand

    


      socrates why do you not know that when a politician writes he begins

      with the names of his approvers

    


      phaedrus how so

    


      socrates why he begins in this manner be it enacted by the senate the

      people or both on the motion of a certain person who is our author

      and so putting on a serious face he proceeds to display his own wisdom to

      his admirers in what is often a long and tedious composition now what is

      that sort of thing but a regular piece of authorship

    


      phaedrus true

    


      socrates and if the law is finally approved then the author leaves the

      theatre in high delight but if the law is rejected and he is done out of

      his speechmaking and not thought good enough to write then he and his

      party are in mourning

    


      phaedrus very true

    


      socrates so far are they from despising or rather so highly do they

      value the practice of writing

    


      phaedrus no doubt

    


      socrates and when the king or orator has the power as lycurgus or solon

      or darius had of attaining an immortality or authorship in a state is he

      not thought by posterity when they see his compositions and does he not

      think himself while he is yet alive to be a god

    


      phaedrus very true

    


      socrates then do you think that any one of this class however

      illdisposed would reproach lysias with being an author

    


      phaedrus not upon your view for according to you he would be casting a

      slur upon his own favourite pursuit

    


      socrates any one may see that there is no disgrace in the mere fact of

      writing

    


      phaedrus certainly not

    


      socrates the disgrace begins when a man writes not well but badly

    


      phaedrus clearly

    


      socrates and what is well and what is badlyneed we ask lysias or

      any other poet or orator who ever wrote or will write either a political

      or any other work in metre or out of metre poet or prose writer to

      teach us this

    


      phaedrus need we for what should a man live if not for the pleasures of

      discourse surely not for the sake of bodily pleasures which almost

      always have previous pain as a condition of them and therefore are

      rightly called slavish

    


      socrates there is time enough and i believe that the grasshoppers

      chirruping after their manner in the heat of the sun over our heads are

      talking to one another and looking down at us what would they say if they

      saw that we like the many are not conversing but slumbering at midday

      lulled by their voices too indolent to think would they not have a right

      to laugh at us they might imagine that we were slaves who coming to

      rest at a place of resort of theirs like sheep lie asleep at noon around

      the well but if they see us discoursing and like odysseus sailing past

      them deaf to their siren voices they may perhaps out of respect give

      us of the gifts which they receive from the gods that they may impart them

      to men

    


      phaedrus what gifts do you mean i never heard of any

    


      socrates a lover of music like yourself ought surely to have heard the

      story of the grasshoppers who are said to have been human beings in an

      age before the muses and when the muses came and song appeared they were

      ravished with delight and singing always never thought of eating and

      drinking until at last in their forgetfulness they died and now they

      live again in the grasshoppers and this is the return which the muses

      make to themthey neither hunger nor thirst but from the hour of

      their birth are always singing and never eating or drinking and when

      they die they go and inform the muses in heaven who honours them on earth

      they win the love of terpsichore for the dancers by their report of them

      of erato for the lovers and of the other muses for those who do them

      honour according to the several ways of honouring themof calliope

      the eldest muse and of urania who is next to her for the philosophers of

      whose music the grasshoppers make report to them for these are the muses

      who are chiefly concerned with heaven and thought divine as well as

      human and they have the sweetest utterance for many reasons then we

      ought always to talk and not to sleep at midday

    


      phaedrus let us talk

    


      socrates shall we discuss the rules of writing and speech as we were

      proposing

    


      phaedrus very good

    


      socrates in good speaking should not the mind of the speaker know the

      truth of the matter about which he is going to speak

    


      phaedrus and yet socrates i have heard that he who would be an orator

      has nothing to do with true justice but only with that which is likely to

      be approved by the many who sit in judgment nor with the truly good or

      honourable but only with opinion about them and that from opinion comes

      persuasion and not from the truth

    


      socrates the words of the wise are not to be set aside for there is

      probably something in them and therefore the meaning of this saying is

      not hastily to be dismissed

    


      phaedrus very true

    


      socrates let us put the matter thussuppose that i persuaded you

      to buy a horse and go to the wars neither of us knew what a horse was

      like but i knew that you believed a horse to be of tame animals the one

      which has the longest ears

    


      phaedrus that would be ridiculous

    


      socrates there is something more ridiculous comingsuppose

      further that in sober earnest i having persuaded you of this went and

      composed a speech in honour of an ass whom i entitled a horse beginning

      a noble animal and a most useful possession especially in war and you

      may get on his back and fight and he will carry baggage or anything

    


      phaedrus how ridiculous

    


      socrates ridiculous yes but is not even a ridiculous friend better than

      a cunning enemy

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates and when the orator instead of putting an ass in the place of a

      horse puts good for evil being himself as ignorant of their true nature

      as the city on which he imposes is ignorant and having studied the

      notions of the multitude falsely persuades them not about the shadow of

      an ass which he confounds with a horse but about good which he

      confounds with evilwhat will be the harvest which rhetoric will be

      likely to gather after the sowing of that seed

    


      phaedrus the reverse of good

    


      socrates but perhaps rhetoric has been getting too roughly handled by us

      and she might answer what amazing nonsense you are talking as if i

      forced any man to learn to speak in ignorance of the truth whatever my

      advice may be worth i should have told him to arrive at the truth first

      and then come to me at the same time i boldly assert that mere knowledge

      of the truth will not give you the art of persuasion

    


      phaedrus there is reason in the ladys defence of herself

    


      socrates quite true if only the other arguments which remain to be

      brought up bear her witness that she is an art at all but i seem to hear

      them arraying themselves on the opposite side declaring that she speaks

      falsely and that rhetoric is a mere routine and trick not an art lo a

      spartan appears and says that there never is nor ever will be a real art

      of speaking which is divorced from the truth

    


      phaedrus and what are these arguments socrates bring them out that we

      may examine them

    


      socrates come out fair children and convince phaedrus who is the

      father of similar beauties that he will never be able to speak about

      anything as he ought to speak unless he have a knowledge of philosophy

      and let phaedrus answer you

    


      phaedrus put the question

    


      socrates is not rhetoric taken generally a universal art of enchanting

      the mind by arguments which is practised not only in courts and public

      assemblies but in private houses also having to do with all matters

      great as well as small good and bad alike and is in all equally right

      and equally to be esteemedthat is what you have heard

    


      phaedrus nay not exactly that i should say rather that i have heard the

      art confined to speaking and writing in lawsuits and to speaking in

      public assembliesnot extended farther

    


      socrates then i suppose that you have only heard of the rhetoric of

      nestor and odysseus which they composed in their leisure hours when at

      troy and never of the rhetoric of palamedes

    


      phaedrus no more than of nestor and odysseus unless gorgias is your

      nestor and thrasymachus or theodorus your odysseus

    


      socrates perhaps that is my meaning but let us leave them and do you

      tell me instead what are plaintiff and defendant doing in a law courtare

      they not contending

    


      phaedrus exactly so

    


      socrates about the just and unjustthat is the matter in dispute

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates and a professor of the art will make the same thing appear to

      the same persons to be at one time just at another time if he is so

      inclined to be unjust

    


      phaedrus exactly

    


      socrates and when he speaks in the assembly he will make the same things

      seem good to the city at one time and at another time the reverse of

      good

    


      phaedrus that is true

    


      socrates have we not heard of the eleatic palamedes zeno who has an

      art of speaking by which he makes the same things appear to his hearers

      like and unlike one and many at rest and in motion

    


      phaedrus very true

    


      socrates the art of disputation then is not confined to the courts and

      the assembly but is one and the same in every use of language this is

      the art if there be such an art which is able to find a likeness of

      everything to which a likeness can be found and draws into the light of

      day the likenesses and disguises which are used by others

    


      phaedrus how do you mean

    


      socrates let me put the matter thus when will there be more chance of

      deceptionwhen the difference is large or small

    


      phaedrus when the difference is small

    


      socrates and you will be less likely to be discovered in passing by

      degrees into the other extreme than when you go all at once

    


      phaedrus of course

    


      socrates he then who would deceive others and not be deceived must

      exactly know the real likenesses and differences of things

    


      phaedrus he must

    


      socrates and if he is ignorant of the true nature of any subject how can

      he detect the greater or less degree of likeness in other things to that

      of which by the hypothesis he is ignorant

    


      phaedrus he cannot

    


      socrates and when men are deceived and their notions are at variance with

      realities it is clear that the error slips in through resemblances

    


      phaedrus yes that is the way

    


      socrates then he who would be a master of the art must understand the

      real nature of everything or he will never know either how to make the

      gradual departure from truth into the opposite of truth which is effected

      by the help of resemblances or how to avoid it

    


      phaedrus he will not

    


      socrates he then who being ignorant of the truth aims at appearances

      will only attain an art of rhetoric which is ridiculous and is not an art

      at all

    


      phaedrus that may be expected

    


      socrates shall i propose that we look for examples of art and want of

      art according to our notion of them in the speech of lysias which you

      have in your hand and in my own speech

    


      phaedrus nothing could be better and indeed i think that our previous

      argument has been too abstract and wanting in illustrations

    


      socrates yes and the two speeches happen to afford a very good example

      of the way in which the speaker who knows the truth may without any

      serious purpose steal away the hearts of his hearers this piece of

      goodfortune i attribute to the local deities and perhaps the prophets

      of the muses who are singing over our heads may have imparted their

      inspiration to me for i do not imagine that i have any rhetorical art of

      my own

    


      phaedrus granted if you will only please to get on

    


      socrates suppose that you read me the first words of lysias speech

    


      phaedrus you know how matters stand with me and how as i conceive

      they might be arranged for our common interest and i maintain that i

      ought not to fail in my suit because i am not your lover for lovers

      repent

    


      socrates enoughnow shall i point out the rhetorical error of

      those words

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates every one is aware that about some things we are agreed whereas

      about other things we differ

    


      phaedrus i think that i understand you but will you explain yourself

    


      socrates when any one speaks of iron and silver is not the same thing

      present in the minds of all

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates but when any one speaks of justice and goodness we part company

      and are at odds with one another and with ourselves

    


      phaedrus precisely

    


      socrates then in some things we agree but not in others

    


      phaedrus that is true

    


      socrates in which are we more likely to be deceived and in which has

      rhetoric the greater power

    


      phaedrus clearly in the uncertain class

    


      socrates then the rhetorician ought to make a regular division and

      acquire a distinct notion of both classes as well of that in which the

      many err as of that in which they do not err

    


      phaedrus he who made such a distinction would have an excellent

      principle

    


      socrates yes and in the next place he must have a keen eye for the

      observation of particulars in speaking and not make a mistake about the

      class to which they are to be referred

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates now to which class does love belongto the debatable or to

      the undisputed class

    


      phaedrus to the debatable clearly for if not do you think that love

      would have allowed you to say as you did that he is an evil both to the

      lover and the beloved and also the greatest possible good

    


      socrates capital but will you tell me whether i defined love at the

      beginning of my speech for having been in an ecstasy i cannot well

      remember

    


      phaedrus yes indeed that you did and no mistake

    


      socrates then i perceive that the nymphs of achelous and pan the son of

      hermes who inspired me were far better rhetoricians than lysias the son

      of cephalus alas how inferior to them he is but perhaps i am mistaken

      and lysias at the commencement of his lovers speech did insist on our

      supposing love to be something or other which he fancied him to be and

      according to this model he fashioned and framed the remainder of his

      discourse suppose we read his beginning over again

    


      phaedrus if you please but you will not find what you want

    


      socrates read that i may have his exact words

    


      phaedrus you know how matters stand with me and how as i conceive

      they might be arranged for our common interest and i maintain i ought not

      to fail in my suit because i am not your lover for lovers repent of the

      kindnesses which they have shown when their love is over

    


      socrates here he appears to have done just the reverse of what he ought

      for he has begun at the end and is swimming on his back through the flood

      to the place of starting his address to the fair youth begins where the

      lover would have ended am i not right sweet phaedrus

    


      phaedrus yes indeed socrates he does begin at the end

    


      socrates then as to the other topicsare they not thrown down

      anyhow is there any principle in them why should the next topic follow

      next in order or any other topic i cannot help fancying in my ignorance

      that he wrote off boldly just what came into his head but i dare say that

      you would recognize a rhetorical necessity in the succession of the

      several parts of the composition

    


      phaedrus you have too good an opinion of me if you think that i have any

      such insight into his principles of composition

    


      socrates at any rate you will allow that every discourse ought to be a

      living creature having a body of its own and a head and feet there

      should be a middle beginning and end adapted to one another and to the

      whole

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates can this be said of the discourse of lysias see whether you can

      find any more connexion in his words than in the epitaph which is said by

      some to have been inscribed on the grave of midas the phrygian

    


      phaedrus what is there remarkable in the epitaph

    


      socrates it is as follows

    


      i am a maiden of bronze and lie on the tomb of midas so long as water

      flows and tall trees grow so long here on this spot by his sad tomb

      abiding i shall declare to passersby that midas sleeps below

    


      now in this rhyme whether a line comes first or comes last as you will

      perceive makes no difference

    


      phaedrus you are making fun of that oration of ours

    


      socrates well i will say no more about your friends speech lest i

      should give offence to you although i think that it might furnish many

      other examples of what a man ought rather to avoid but i will proceed to

      the other speech which as i think is also suggestive to students of

      rhetoric

    


      phaedrus in what way

    


      socrates the two speeches as you may remember were unlike the one

      argued that the lover and the other that the nonlover ought to be

      accepted

    


      phaedrus and right manfully

    


      socrates you should rather say madly and madness was the argument of

      them for as i said love is a madness

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates and of madness there were two kinds one produced by human

      infirmity the other was a divine release of the soul from the yoke of

      custom and convention

    


      phaedrus true

    


      socrates the divine madness was subdivided into four kinds prophetic

      initiatory poetic erotic having four gods presiding over them the

      first was the inspiration of apollo the second that of dionysus the

      third that of the muses the fourth that of aphrodite and eros in the

      description of the last kind of madness which was also said to be the

      best we spoke of the affection of love in a figure into which we

      introduced a tolerably credible and possibly true though partly erring

      myth which was also a hymn in honour of love who is your lord and also

      mine phaedrus and the guardian of fair children and to him we sung the

      hymn in measured and solemn strain

    


      phaedrus i know that i had great pleasure in listening to you

    


      socrates let us take this instance and note how the transition was made

      from blame to praise

    


      phaedrus what do you mean

    


      socrates i mean to say that the composition was mostly playful yet in

      these chance fancies of the hour were involved two principles of which we

      should be too glad to have a clearer description if art could give us one

    


      phaedrus what are they

    


      socrates first the comprehension of scattered particulars in one idea

      as in our definition of love which whether true or false certainly gave

      clearness and consistency to the discourse the speaker should define his

      several notions and so make his meaning clear

    


      phaedrus what is the other principle socrates

    


      socrates the second principle is that of division into species according

      to the natural formation where the joint is not breaking any part as a

      bad carver might just as our two discourses alike assumed first of all

      a single form of unreason and then as the body which from being one

      becomes double and may be divided into a left side and right side each

      having parts right and left of the same nameafter this manner the

      speaker proceeded to divide the parts of the left side and did not desist

      until he found in them an evil or lefthanded love which he justly

      reviled and the other discourse leading us to the madness which lay on

      the right side found another love also having the same name but divine

      which the speaker held up before us and applauded and affirmed to be the

      author of the greatest benefits

    


      phaedrus most true

    


      socrates i am myself a great lover of these processes of division and

      generalization they help me to speak and to think and if i find any man

      who is able to see a one and many in nature him i follow and walk in

      his footsteps as if he were a god and those who have this art i have

      hitherto been in the habit of calling dialecticians but god knows whether

      the name is right or not and i should like to know what name you would

      give to your or to lysias disciples and whether this may not be that

      famous art of rhetoric which thrasymachus and others teach and practise

      skilful speakers they are and impart their skill to any who is willing to

      make kings of them and to bring gifts to them

    


      phaedrus yes they are royal men but their art is not the same with the

      art of those whom you call and rightly in my opinion dialecticiansstill

      we are in the dark about rhetoric

    


      socrates what do you mean the remains of it if there be anything

      remaining which can be brought under rules of art must be a fine thing

      and at any rate is not to be despised by you and me but how much is

      left

    


      phaedrus there is a great deal surely to be found in books of rhetoric

    


      socrates yes thank you for reminding methere is the exordium

      showing how the speech should begin if i remember rightly that is what

      you meanthe niceties of the art

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates then follows the statement of facts and upon that witnesses

      thirdly proofs fourthly probabilities are to come the great byzantian

      wordmaker also speaks if i am not mistaken of confirmation and further

      confirmation

    


      phaedrus you mean the excellent theodorus

    


      socrates yes and he tells how refutation or further refutation is to be

      managed whether in accusation or defence i ought also to mention the

      illustrious parian evenus who first invented insinuations and indirect

      praises and also indirect censures which according to some he put into

      verse to help the memory but shall i to dumb forgetfulness consign

      tisias and gorgias who are not ignorant that probability is superior to

      truth and who by force of argument make the little appear great and the

      great little disguise the new in old fashions and the old in new

      fashions and have discovered forms for everything either short or going

      on to infinity i remember prodicus laughing when i told him of this he

      said that he had himself discovered the true rule of art which was to be

      neither long nor short but of a convenient length

    


      phaedrus well done prodicus

    


      socrates then there is hippias the elean stranger who probably agrees

      with him

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates and there is also polus who has treasuries of diplasiology and

      gnomology and eikonology and who teaches in them the names of which

      licymnius made him a present they were to give a polish

    


      phaedrus had not protagoras something of the same sort

    


      socrates yes rules of correct diction and many other fine precepts for

      the sorrows of a poor old man or any other pathetic case no one is

      better than the chalcedonian giant he can put a whole company of people

      into a passion and out of one again by his mighty magic and is firstrate

      at inventing or disposing of any sort of calumny on any grounds or none

      all of them agree in asserting that a speech should end in a

      recapitulation though they do not all agree to use the same word

    


      phaedrus you mean that there should be a summing up of the arguments in

      order to remind the hearers of them

    


      socrates i have now said all that i have to say of the art of rhetoric

      have you anything to add

    


      phaedrus not much nothing very important

    


      socrates leave the unimportant and let us bring the really important

      question into the light of day which is what power has this art of

      rhetoric and when

    


      phaedrus a very great power in public meetings

    


      socrates it has but i should like to know whether you have the same

      feeling as i have about the rhetoricians to me there seem to be a great

      many holes in their web

    


      phaedrus give an example

    


      socrates i will suppose a person to come to your friend eryximachus or

      to his father acumenus and to say to him i know how to apply drugs

      which shall have either a heating or a cooling effect and i can give a

      vomit and also a purge and all that sort of thing and knowing all this

      as i do i claim to be a physician and to make physicians by imparting

      this knowledge to otherswhat do you suppose that they would say

    


      phaedrus they would be sure to ask him whether he knew to whom he would

      give his medicines and when and how much

    


      socrates and suppose that he were to reply no i know nothing of all

      that i expect the patient who consults me to be able to do these things

      for himself

    


      phaedrus they would say in reply that he is a madman or a pedant who

      fancies that he is a physician because he has read something in a book or

      has stumbled on a prescription or two although he has no real

      understanding of the art of medicine

    


      socrates and suppose a person were to come to sophocles or euripides and

      say that he knows how to make a very long speech about a small matter and

      a short speech about a great matter and also a sorrowful speech or a

      terrible or threatening speech or any other kind of speech and in

      teaching this fancies that he is teaching the art of tragedy

    


      phaedrus they too would surely laugh at him if he fancies that tragedy is

      anything but the arranging of these elements in a manner which will be

      suitable to one another and to the whole

    


      socrates but i do not suppose that they would be rude or abusive to him

      would they not treat him as a musician a man who thinks that he is a

      harmonist because he knows how to pitch the highest and lowest note

      happening to meet such an one he would not say to him savagely fool you

      are mad but like a musician in a gentle and harmonious tone of voice

      he would answer my good friend he who would be a harmonist must

      certainly know this and yet he may understand nothing of harmony if he

      has not got beyond your stage of knowledge for you only know the

      preliminaries of harmony and not harmony itself

    


      phaedrus very true

    


      socrates and will not sophocles say to the display of the wouldbe

      tragedian that this is not tragedy but the preliminaries of tragedy and

      will not acumenus say the same of medicine to the wouldbe physician

    


      phaedrus quite true

    


      socrates and if adrastus the mellifluous or pericles heard of these

      wonderful arts brachylogies and eikonologies and all the hard names which

      we have been endeavouring to draw into the light of day what would they

      say instead of losing temper and applying uncomplimentary epithets as

      you and i have been doing to the authors of such an imaginary art their

      superior wisdom would rather censure us as well as them have a little

      patience phaedrus and socrates they would say you should not be in such

      a passion with those who from some want of dialectical skill are unable to

      define the nature of rhetoric and consequently suppose that they have

      found the art in the preliminary conditions of it and when these have

      been taught by them to others fancy that the whole art of rhetoric has

      been taught by them but as to using the several instruments of the art

      effectively or making the composition a wholean application of it

      such as this is they regard as an easy thing which their disciples may

      make for themselves

    


      phaedrus i quite admit socrates that the art of rhetoric which these

      men teach and of which they write is such as you describethere i

      agree with you but i still want to know where and how the true art of

      rhetoric and persuasion is to be acquired

    


      socrates the perfection which is required of the finished orator is or

      rather must be like the perfection of anything else partly given by

      nature but may also be assisted by art if you have the natural power and

      add to it knowledge and practice you will be a distinguished speaker if

      you fall short in either of these you will be to that extent defective

      but the art as far as there is an art of rhetoric does not lie in the

      direction of lysias or thrasymachus

    


      phaedrus in what direction then

    


      socrates i conceive pericles to have been the most accomplished of

      rhetoricians

    


      phaedrus what of that

    


      socrates all the great arts require discussion and high speculation about

      the truths of nature hence come loftiness of thought and completeness of

      execution and this as i conceive was the quality which in addition to

      his natural gifts pericles acquired from his intercourse with anaxagoras

      whom he happened to know he was thus imbued with the higher philosophy

      and attained the knowledge of mind and the negative of mind which were

      favourite themes of anaxagoras and applied what suited his purpose to the

      art of speaking

    


      phaedrus explain

    


      socrates rhetoric is like medicine

    


      phaedrus how so

    


      socrates why because medicine has to define the nature of the body and

      rhetoric of the soulif we would proceed not empirically but

      scientifically in the one case to impart health and strength by giving

      medicine and food in the other to implant the conviction or virtue which

      you desire by the right application of words and training

    


      phaedrus there socrates i suspect that you are right

    


      socrates and do you think that you can know the nature of the soul

      intelligently without knowing the nature of the whole

    


      phaedrus hippocrates the asclepiad says that the nature even of the body

      can only be understood as a whole compare charmides

    


      socrates yes friend and he was rightstill we ought not to be

      content with the name of hippocrates but to examine and see whether his

      argument agrees with his conception of nature

    


      phaedrus i agree

    


      socrates then consider what truth as well as hippocrates says about this

      or about any other nature ought we not to consider first whether that

      which we wish to learn and to teach is a simple or multiform thing and if

      simple then to enquire what power it has of acting or being acted upon in

      relation to other things and if multiform then to number the forms and

      see first in the case of one of them and then in the case of all of them

      what is that power of acting or being acted upon which makes each and all

      of them to be what they are

    


      phaedrus you may very likely be right socrates

    


      socrates the method which proceeds without analysis is like the groping

      of a blind man yet surely he who is an artist ought not to admit of a

      comparison with the blind or deaf the rhetorician who teaches his pupil

      to speak scientifically will particularly set forth the nature of that

      being to which he addresses his speeches and this i conceive to be the

      soul

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates his whole effort is directed to the soul for in that he seeks

      to produce conviction

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates then clearly thrasymachus or any one else who teaches rhetoric

      in earnest will give an exact description of the nature of the soul which

      will enable us to see whether she be single and same or like the body

      multiform that is what we should call showing the nature of the soul

    


      phaedrus exactly

    


      socrates he will explain secondly the mode in which she acts or is

      acted upon

    


      phaedrus true

    


      socrates thirdly having classified men and speeches and their kinds and

      affections and adapted them to one another he will tell the reasons of

      his arrangement and show why one soul is persuaded by a particular form

      of argument and another not

    


      phaedrus you have hit upon a very good way

    


      socrates yes that is the true and only way in which any subject can be

      set forth or treated by rules of art whether in speaking or writing but

      the writers of the present day at whose feet you have sat craftily

      conceal the nature of the soul which they know quite well nor until they

      adopt our method of reading and writing can we admit that they write by

      rules of art

    


      phaedrus what is our method

    


      socrates i cannot give you the exact details but i should like to tell

      you generally as far as is in my power how a man ought to proceed

      according to rules of art

    


      phaedrus let me hear

    


      socrates oratory is the art of enchanting the soul and therefore he who

      would be an orator has to learn the differences of human soulsthey

      are so many and of such a nature and from them come the differences

      between man and man having proceeded thus far in his analysis he will

      next divide speeches into their different classessuch and such

      persons he will say are affected by this or that kind of speech in this

      or that way and he will tell you why the pupil must have a good

      theoretical notion of them first and then he must have experience of them

      in actual life and be able to follow them with all his senses about him

      or he will never get beyond the precepts of his masters but when he

      understands what persons are persuaded by what arguments and sees the

      person about whom he was speaking in the abstract actually before him and

      knows that it is he and can say to himself this is the man or this is

      the character who ought to have a certain argument applied to him in order

      to convince him of a certain opinionhe who knows all this and

      knows also when he should speak and when he should refrain and when he

      should use pithy sayings pathetic appeals sensational effects and all

      the other modes of speech which he has learnedwhen i say he

      knows the times and seasons of all these things then and not till then

      he is a perfect master of his art but if he fail in any of these points

      whether in speaking or teaching or writing them and yet declares that he

      speaks by rules of art he who says i dont believe you has the better

      of him well the teacher will say is this phaedrus and socrates your

      account of the socalled art of rhetoric or am i to look for another

    


      phaedrus he must take this socrates for there is no possibility of

      another and yet the creation of such an art is not easy

    


      socrates very true and therefore let us consider this matter in every

      light and see whether we cannot find a shorter and easier road there is

      no use in taking a long rough roundabout way if there be a shorter and

      easier one and i wish that you would try and remember whether you have

      heard from lysias or any one else anything which might be of service to

      us

    


      phaedrus if trying would avail then i might but at the moment i can

      think of nothing

    


      socrates suppose i tell you something which somebody who knows told me

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates may not the wolf as the proverb says claim a hearing

    


      phaedrus do you say what can be said for him

    


      socrates he will argue that there is no use in putting a solemn face on

      these matters or in going round and round until you arrive at first

      principles for as i said at first when the question is of justice and

      good or is a question in which men are concerned who are just and good

      either by nature or habit he who would be a skilful rhetorician has no

      need of truthfor that in courts of law men literally care nothing

      about truth but only about conviction and this is based on probability

      to which he who would be a skilful orator should therefore give his whole

      attention and they say also that there are cases in which the actual

      facts if they are improbable ought to be withheld and only the

      probabilities should be told either in accusation or defence and that

      always in speaking the orator should keep probability in view and say

      goodbye to the truth and the observance of this principle throughout a

      speech furnishes the whole art

    


      phaedrus that is what the professors of rhetoric do actually say

      socrates i have not forgotten that we have quite briefly touched upon

      this matter already with them the point is allimportant

    


      socrates i dare say that you are familiar with tisias does he not define

      probability to be that which the many think

    


      phaedrus certainly he does

    


      socrates i believe that he has a clever and ingenious case of this sorthe

      supposes a feeble and valiant man to have assaulted a strong and cowardly

      one and to have robbed him of his coat or of something or other he is

      brought into court and then tisias says that both parties should tell

      lies the coward should say that he was assaulted by more men than one

      the other should prove that they were alone and should argue thus how

      could a weak man like me have assaulted a strong man like him the

      complainant will not like to confess his own cowardice and will therefore

      invent some other lie which his adversary will thus gain an opportunity of

      refuting and there are other devices of the same kind which have a place

      in the system am i not right phaedrus

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates bless me what a wonderfully mysterious art is this which tisias

      or some other gentleman in whatever name or country he rejoices has

      discovered shall we say a word to him or not

    


      phaedrus what shall we say to him

    


      socrates let us tell him that before he appeared you and i were saying

      that the probability of which he speaks was engendered in the minds of the

      many by the likeness of the truth and we had just been affirming that he

      who knew the truth would always know best how to discover the resemblances

      of the truth if he has anything else to say about the art of speaking we

      should like to hear him but if not we are satisfied with our own view

      that unless a man estimates the various characters of his hearers and is

      able to divide all things into classes and to comprehend them under single

      ideas he will never be a skilful rhetorician even within the limits of

      human power and this skill he will not attain without a great deal of

      trouble which a good man ought to undergo not for the sake of speaking

      and acting before men but in order that he may be able to say what is

      acceptable to god and always to act acceptably to him as far as in him

      lies for there is a saying of wiser men than ourselves that a man of

      sense should not try to please his fellowservants at least this should

      not be his first object but his good and noble masters and therefore if

      the way is long and circuitous marvel not at this for where the end is

      great there we may take the longer road but not for lesser ends such as

      yours truly the argument may say tisias that if you do not mind going

      so far rhetoric has a fair beginning here

    


      phaedrus i think socrates that this is admirable if only practicable

    


      socrates but even to fail in an honourable object is honourable

    


      phaedrus true

    


      socrates enough appears to have been said by us of a true and false art

      of speaking

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates but there is something yet to be said of propriety and

      impropriety of writing

    


      phaedrus yes

    


      socrates do you know how you can speak or act about rhetoric in a manner

      which will be acceptable to god

    


      phaedrus no indeed do you

    


      socrates i have heard a tradition of the ancients whether true or not

      they only know although if we had found the truth ourselves do you think

      that we should care much about the opinions of men

    


      phaedrus your question needs no answer but i wish that you would tell me

      what you say that you have heard

    


      socrates at the egyptian city of naucratis there was a famous old god

      whose name was theuth the bird which is called the ibis is sacred to him

      and he was the inventor of many arts such as arithmetic and calculation

      and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice but his great discovery

      was the use of letters now in those days the god thamus was the king of

      the whole country of egypt and he dwelt in that great city of upper egypt

      which the hellenes call egyptian thebes and the god himself is called by

      them ammon to him came theuth and showed his inventions desiring that

      the other egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them he

      enumerated them and thamus enquired about their several uses and praised

      some of them and censured others as he approved or disapproved of them

      it would take a long time to repeat all that thamus said to theuth in

      praise or blame of the various arts but when they came to letters this

      said theuth will make the egyptians wiser and give them better memories

      it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit thamus replied o

      most ingenious theuth the parent or inventor of an art is not always the

      best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users

      of them and in this instance you who are the father of letters from a

      paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a

      quality which they cannot have for this discovery of yours will create

      forgetfulness in the learners souls because they will not use their

      memories they will trust to the external written characters and not

      remember of themselves the specific which you have discovered is an aid

      not to memory but to reminiscence and you give your disciples not truth

      but only the semblance of truth they will be hearers of many things and

      will have learned nothing they will appear to be omniscient and will

      generally know nothing they will be tiresome company having the show of

      wisdom without the reality

    


      phaedrus yes socrates you can easily invent tales of egypt or of any

      other country

    


      socrates there was a tradition in the temple of dodona that oaks first

      gave prophetic utterances the men of old unlike in their simplicity to

      young philosophy deemed that if they heard the truth even from oak or

      rock it was enough for them whereas you seem to consider not whether a

      thing is or is not true but who the speaker is and from what country the

      tale comes

    


      phaedrus i acknowledge the justice of your rebuke and i think that the

      theban is right in his view about letters

    


      socrates he would be a very simple person and quite a stranger to the

      oracles of thamus or ammon who should leave in writing or receive in

      writing any art under the idea that the written word would be intelligible

      or certain or who deemed that writing was at all better than knowledge

      and recollection of the same matters

    


      phaedrus that is most true

    


      socrates i cannot help feeling phaedrus that writing is unfortunately

      like painting for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life

      and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence and the

      same may be said of speeches you would imagine that they had

      intelligence but if you want to know anything and put a question to one

      of them the speaker always gives one unvarying answer and when they have

      been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may

      or may not understand them and know not to whom they should reply to

      whom not and if they are maltreated or abused they have no parent to

      protect them and they cannot protect or defend themselves

    


      phaedrus that again is most true

    


      socrates is there not another kind of word or speech far better than

      this and having far greater powera son of the same family but

      lawfully begotten

    


      phaedrus whom do you mean and what is his origin

    


      socrates i mean an intelligent word graven in the soul of the learner

      which can defend itself and knows when to speak and when to be silent

    


      phaedrus you mean the living word of knowledge which has a soul and of

      which the written word is properly no more than an image

    


      socrates yes of course that is what i mean and now may i be allowed to

      ask you a question would a husbandman who is a man of sense take the

      seeds which he values and which he wishes to bear fruit and in sober

      seriousness plant them during the heat of summer in some garden of

      adonis that he may rejoice when he sees them in eight days appearing in

      beauty at least he would do so if at all only for the sake of amusement

      and pastime but when he is in earnest he sows in fitting soil and

      practises husbandry and is satisfied if in eight months the seeds which

      he has sown arrive at perfection

    


      phaedrus yes socrates that will be his way when he is in earnest he

      will do the other as you say only in play

    


      socrates and can we suppose that he who knows the just and good and

      honourable has less understanding than the husbandman about his own

      seeds

    


      phaedrus certainly not

    


      socrates then he will not seriously incline to write his thoughts in

      water with pen and ink sowing words which can neither speak for

      themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others

    


      phaedrus no that is not likely

    


      socrates no that is not likelyin the garden of letters he will

      sow and plant but only for the sake of recreation and amusement he will

      write them down as memorials to be treasured against the forgetfulness of

      old age by himself or by any other old man who is treading the same

      path he will rejoice in beholding their tender growth and while others

      are refreshing their souls with banqueting and the like this will be the

      pastime in which his days are spent

    


      phaedrus a pastime socrates as noble as the other is ignoble the

      pastime of a man who can be amused by serious talk and can discourse

      merrily about justice and the like

    


      socrates true phaedrus but nobler far is the serious pursuit of the

      dialectician who finding a congenial soul by the help of science sows

      and plants therein words which are able to help themselves and him who

      planted them and are not unfruitful but have in them a seed which others

      brought up in different soils render immortal making the possessors of it

      happy to the utmost extent of human happiness

    


      phaedrus far nobler certainly

    


      socrates and now phaedrus having agreed upon the premises we may decide

      about the conclusion

    


      phaedrus about what conclusion

    


      socrates about lysias whom we censured and his art of writing and his

      discourses and the rhetorical skill or want of skill which was shown in

      themthese are the questions which we sought to determine and they

      brought us to this point and i think that we are now pretty well informed

      about the nature of art and its opposite

    


      phaedrus yes i think with you but i wish that you would repeat what was

      said

    


      socrates until a man knows the truth of the several particulars of which

      he is writing or speaking and is able to define them as they are and

      having defined them again to divide them until they can be no longer

      divided and until in like manner he is able to discern the nature of the

      soul and discover the different modes of discourse which are adapted to

      different natures and to arrange and dispose them in such a way that the

      simple form of speech may be addressed to the simpler nature and the

      complex and composite to the more complex natureuntil he has

      accomplished all this he will be unable to handle arguments according to

      rules of art as far as their nature allows them to be subjected to art

      either for the purpose of teaching or persuadingsuch is the view

      which is implied in the whole preceding argument

    


      phaedrus yes that was our view certainly

    


      socrates secondly as to the censure which was passed on the speaking or

      writing of discourses and how they might be rightly or wrongly censureddid

      not our previous argument show

    


      phaedrus show what

    


      socrates that whether lysias or any other writer that ever was or will

      be whether private man or statesman proposes laws and so becomes the

      author of a political treatise fancying that there is any great certainty

      and clearness in his performance the fact of his so writing is only a

      disgrace to him whatever men may say for not to know the nature of

      justice and injustice and good and evil and not to be able to

      distinguish the dream from the reality cannot in truth be otherwise than

      disgraceful to him even though he have the applause of the whole world

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates but he who thinks that in the written word there is necessarily

      much which is not serious and that neither poetry nor prose spoken or

      written is of any great value if like the compositions of the

      rhapsodes they are only recited in order to be believed and not with any

      view to criticism or instruction and who thinks that even the best of

      writings are but a reminiscence of what we know and that only in

      principles of justice and goodness and nobility taught and communicated

      orally for the sake of instruction and graven in the soul which is the

      true way of writing is there clearness and perfection and seriousness

      and that such principles are a mans own and his legitimate offspringbeing

      in the first place the word which he finds in his own bosom secondly

      the brethren and descendants and relations of his idea which have been

      duly implanted by him in the souls of othersand who cares for them

      and no othersthis is the right sort of man and you and i

      phaedrus would pray that we may become like him

    


      phaedrus that is most assuredly my desire and prayer

    


      socrates and now the play is played out and of rhetoric enough go and

      tell lysias that to the fountain and school of the nymphs we went down

      and were bidden by them to convey a message to him and to other composers

      of speechesto homer and other writers of poems whether set to

      music or not and to solon and others who have composed writings in the

      form of political discourses which they would term lawsto all of

      them we are to say that if their compositions are based on knowledge of

      the truth and they can defend or prove them when they are put to the

      test by spoken arguments which leave their writings poor in comparison

      of them then they are to be called not only poets orators legislators

      but are worthy of a higher name befitting the serious pursuit of their

      life

    


      phaedrus what name would you assign to them

    


      socrates wise i may not call them for that is a great name which

      belongs to god alonelovers of wisdom or philosophers is their

      modest and befitting title

    


      phaedrus very suitable

    


      socrates and he who cannot rise above his own compilations and

      compositions which he has been long patching and piecing adding some and

      taking away some may be justly called poet or speechmaker or lawmaker

    


      phaedrus certainly

    


      socrates now go and tell this to your companion

    


      phaedrus but there is also a friend of yours who ought not to be

      forgotten

    


      socrates who is he

    


      phaedrus isocrates the fairwhat message will you send to him and

      how shall we describe him

    


      socrates isocrates is still young phaedrus but i am willing to hazard a

      prophecy concerning him

    


      phaedrus what would you prophesy

    


      socrates i think that he has a genius which soars above the orations of

      lysias and that his character is cast in a finer mould my impression of

      him is that he will marvellously improve as he grows older and that all

      former rhetoricians will be as children in comparison of him and i

      believe that he will not be satisfied with rhetoric but that there is in

      him a divine inspiration which will lead him to things higher still for

      he has an element of philosophy in his nature this is the message of the

      gods dwelling in this place and which i will myself deliver to isocrates

      who is my delight and do you give the other to lysias who is yours

    


      phaedrus i will and now as the heat is abated let us depart

    


      socrates should we not offer up a prayer first of all to the local

      deities

    


      phaedrus by all means

    


      socrates beloved pan and all ye other gods who haunt this place give me

      beauty in the inward soul and may the outward and inward man be at one

      may i reckon the wise to be the wealthy and may i have such a quantity of

      gold as a temperate man and he only can bear and carryanything

      more the prayer i think is enough for me

    


      phaedrus ask the same for me for friends should have all things in

      common

    


      socrates let us go

      introduction

    


      of all the works of plato the symposium is the most perfect in form and

      may be truly thought to contain more than any commentator has ever dreamed

      of or as goethe said of one of his own writings more than the author

      himself knew for in philosophy as in prophecy glimpses of the future may

      often be conveyed in words which could hardly have been understood or

      interpreted at the time when they were uttered compare sympwhich

      were wiser than the writer of them meant and could not have been

      expressed by him if he had been interrogated about them yet plato was not

      a mystic nor in any degree affected by the eastern influences which

      afterwards overspread the alexandrian world he was not an enthusiast or a

      sentimentalist but one who aspired only to see reasoned truth and whose

      thoughts are clearly explained in his language there is no foreign

      element either of egypt or of asia to be found in his writings and more

      than any other platonic work the symposium is greek both in style and

      subject having a beauty as of a statue while the companion dialogue of

      the phaedrus is marked by a sort of gothic irregularity more too than in

      any other of his dialogues plato is emancipated from former philosophies

      the genius of greek art seems to triumph over the traditions of

      pythagorean eleatic or megarian systems and the old quarrel of poetry

      and philosophy has at least a superficial reconcilement rep

    


      an unknown person who had heard of the discourses in praise of love spoken

      by socrates and others at the banquet of agathon is desirous of having an

      authentic account of them which he thinks that he can obtain from

      apollodorus the same excitable or rather mad friend of socrates who

      is afterwards introduced in the phaedo he had imagined that the

      discourses were recent there he is mistaken but they are still fresh in

      the memory of his informant who had just been repeating them to glaucon

      and is quite prepared to have another rehearsal of them in a walk from the

      piraeus to athens although he had not been present himself he had heard

      them from the best authority aristodemus who is described as having been

      in past times a humble but inseparable attendant of socrates had reported

      them to him compare xen mem

    


      the narrative which he had heard was as follows

    


      aristodemus meeting socrates in holiday attire is invited by him to a

      banquet at the house of agathon who had been sacrificing in thanksgiving

      for his tragic victory on the day previous but no sooner has he entered

      the house than he finds that he is alone socrates has stayed behind in a

      fit of abstraction and does not appear until the banquet is half over on

      his appearing he and the host jest a little the question is then asked by

      pausanias one of the guests what shall they do about drinking as they

      had been all well drunk on the day before and drinking on two successive

      days is such a bad thing this is confirmed by the authority of

      eryximachus the physician who further proposes that instead of listening

      to the flutegirl and her noise they shall make speeches in honour of

      love one after another going from left to right in the order in which

      they are reclining at the table all of them agree to this proposal and

      phaedrus who is the father of the idea which he has previously

      communicated to eryximachus begins as follows

    


      he descants first of all upon the antiquity of love which is proved by

      the authority of the poets secondly upon the benefits which love gives to

      man the greatest of these is the sense of honour and dishonour the lover

      is ashamed to be seen by the beloved doing or suffering any cowardly or

      mean act and a state or army which was made up only of lovers and their

      loves would be invincible for love will convert the veriest coward into

      an inspired hero

    


      and there have been true loves not only of men but of women also such was

      the love of alcestis who dared to die for her husband and in recompense

      of her virtue was allowed to come again from the dead but orpheus the

      miserable harper who went down to hades alive that he might bring back

      his wife was mocked with an apparition only and the gods afterwards

      contrived his death as the punishment of his cowardliness the love of

      achilles like that of alcestis was courageous and true for he was

      willing to avenge his lover patroclus although he knew that his own death

      would immediately follow and the gods who honour the love of the beloved

      above that of the lover rewarded him and sent him to the islands of the

      blest

    


      pausanias who was sitting next then takes up the talehe says

      that phaedrus should have distinguished the heavenly love from the

      earthly before he praised either for there are two loves as there are

      two aphroditesone the daughter of uranus who has no mother and is

      the elder and wiser goddess and the other the daughter of zeus and

      dione who is popular and common the first of the two loves has a noble

      purpose and delights only in the intelligent nature of man and is

      faithful to the end and has no shadow of wantonness or lust the second

      is the coarser kind of love which is a love of the body rather than of

      the soul and is of women and boys as well as of men now the actions of

      lovers vary like every other sort of action according to the manner of

      their performance and in different countries there is a difference of

      opinion about male loves some like the boeotians approve of them

      others like the ionians and most of the barbarians disapprove of them

      partly because they are aware of the political dangers which ensue from

      them as may be seen in the instance of harmodius and aristogeiton at

      athens and sparta there is an apparent contradiction about them for at

      times they are encouraged and then the lover is allowed to play all sorts

      of fantastic tricks he may swear and forswear himself and at lovers

      perjuries they say jove laughs he may be a servant and lie on a mat at

      the door of his love without any loss of character but there are also

      times when elders look grave and guard their young relations and personal

      remarks are made the truth is that some of these loves are disgraceful

      and others honourable the vulgar love of the body which takes wing and

      flies away when the bloom of youth is over is disgraceful and so is the

      interested love of power or wealth but the love of the noble mind is

      lasting the lover should be tested and the beloved should not be too

      ready to yield the rule in our country is that the beloved may do the

      same service to the lover in the way of virtue which the lover may do to

      him

    


      a voluntary service to be rendered for the sake of virtue and wisdom is

      permitted among us and when these two customsone the love of

      youth the other the practice of virtue and philosophymeet in one

      then the lovers may lawfully unite nor is there any disgrace to a

      disinterested lover in being deceived but the interested lover is doubly

      disgraced for if he loses his love he loses his character whereas the

      noble love of the other remains the same although the object of his love

      is unworthy for nothing can be nobler than love for the sake of virtue

      this is that love of the heavenly goddess which is of great price to

      individuals and cities making them work together for their improvement

    


      the turn of aristophanes comes next but he has the hiccough and

      therefore proposes that eryximachus the physician shall cure him or speak

      in his turn eryximachus is ready to do both and after prescribing for

      the hiccough speaks as follows

    


      he agrees with pausanias in maintaining that there are two kinds of love

      but his art has led him to the further conclusion that the empire of this

      double love extends over all things and is to be found in animals and

      plants as well as in man in the human body also there are two loves and

      the art of medicine shows which is the good and which is the bad love and

      persuades the body to accept the good and reject the bad and reconciles

      conflicting elements and makes them friends every art gymnastic and

      husbandry as well as medicine is the reconciliation of opposites and

      this is what heracleitus meant when he spoke of a harmony of opposites

      but in strictness he should rather have spoken of a harmony which succeeds

      opposites for an agreement of disagreements there cannot be music too is

      concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and

      rhythm in the abstract all is simple and we are not troubled with the

      twofold love but when they are applied in education with their

      accompaniments of song and metre then the discord begins then the old

      tale has to be repeated of fair urania and the coarse polyhymnia who must

      be indulged sparingly just as in my own art of medicine care must be

      taken that the taste of the epicure be gratified without inflicting upon

      him the attendant penalty of disease

    


      there is a similar harmony or disagreement in the course of the seasons

      and in the relations of moist and dry hot and cold hoar frost and

      blight and diseases of all sorts spring from the excesses or disorders of

      the element of love the knowledge of these elements of love and discord

      in the heavenly bodies is termed astronomy in the relations of men

      towards gods and parents is called divination for divination is the

      peacemaker of gods and men and works by a knowledge of the tendencies of

      merely human loves to piety and impiety such is the power of love and

      that love which is just and temperate has the greatest power and is the

      source of all our happiness and friendship with the gods and with one

      another i dare say that i have omitted to mention many things which you

      aristophanes may supply as i perceive that you are cured of the

      hiccough

    


      aristophanes is the next speaker

    


      he professes to open a new vein of discourse in which he begins by

      treating of the origin of human nature the sexes were originally three

      men women and the union of the two and they were made roundhaving

      four hands four feet two faces on a round neck and the rest to

      correspond terrible was their strength and swiftness and they were

      essaying to scale heaven and attack the gods doubt reigned in the

      celestial councils the gods were divided between the desire of quelling

      the pride of man and the fear of losing the sacrifices at last zeus hit

      upon an expedient let us cut them in two he said then they will only

      have half their strength and we shall have twice as many sacrifices he

      spake and split them as you might split an egg with an hair and when

      this was done he told apollo to give their faces a twist and rearrange

      their persons taking out the wrinkles and tying the skin in a knot about

      the navel the two halves went about looking for one another and were

      ready to die of hunger in one anothers arms then zeus invented an

      adjustment of the sexes which enabled them to marry and go their way to

      the business of life now the characters of men differ accordingly as they

      are derived from the original man or the original woman or the original

      manwoman those who come from the manwoman are lascivious and

      adulterous those who come from the woman form female attachments those

      who are a section of the male follow the male and embrace him and in him

      all their desires centre the pair are inseparable and live together in

      pure and manly affection yet they cannot tell what they want of one

      another but if hephaestus were to come to them with his instruments and

      propose that they should be melted into one and remain one here and

      hereafter they would acknowledge that this was the very expression of

      their want for love is the desire of the whole and the pursuit of the

      whole is called love there was a time when the two sexes were only one

      but now god has halved themmuch as the lacedaemonians have cut up

      the arcadiansand if they do not behave themselves he will divide

      them again and they will hop about with half a nose and face in basso

      relievo wherefore let us exhort all men to piety that we may obtain the

      goods of which love is the author and be reconciled to god and find our

      own true loves which rarely happens in this world and now i must beg you

      not to suppose that i am alluding to pausanias and agathon compare

      protag for my words refer to all mankind everywhere

    


      some raillery ensues first between aristophanes and eryximachus and then

      between agathon who fears a few select friends more than any number of

      spectators at the theatre and socrates who is disposed to begin an

      argument this is speedily repressed by phaedrus who reminds the

      disputants of their tribute to the god agathons speech follows

    


      he will speak of the god first and then of his gifts he is the fairest

      and blessedest and best of the gods and also the youngest having had no

      existence in the old days of iapetus and cronos when the gods were at war

      the things that were done then were done of necessity and not of love for

      love is young and dwells in soft placesnot like ate in homer

      walking on the skulls of men but in their hearts and souls which are

      soft enough he is all flexibility and grace and his habitation is among

      the flowers and he cannot do or suffer wrong for all men serve and obey

      him of their own free will and where there is love there is obedience

      and where obedience there is justice for none can be wronged of his own

      free will and he is temperate as well as just for he is the ruler of the

      desires and if he rules them he must be temperate also he is courageous

      for he is the conqueror of the lord of war and he is wise too for he is

      a poet and the author of poesy in others he created the animals he is

      the inventor of the arts all the gods are his subjects he is the fairest

      and best himself and the cause of what is fairest and best in others he

      makes men to be of one mind at a banquet filling them with affection and

      emptying them of disaffection the pilot helper defender saviour of

      men in whose footsteps let every man follow chanting a strain of love

      such is the discourse half playful half serious which i dedicate to the

      god

    


      the turn of socrates comes next he begins by remarking satirically that

      he has not understood the terms of the original agreement for he fancied

      that they meant to speak the true praises of love but now he finds that

      they only say what is good of him whether true or false he begs to be

      absolved from speaking falsely but he is willing to speak the truth and

      proposes to begin by questioning agathon the result of his questions may

      be summed up as follows

    


      love is of something and that which love desires is not that which love

      is or has for no man desires that which he is or has and love is of the

      beautiful and therefore has not the beautiful and the beautiful is the

      good and therefore in wanting and desiring the beautiful love also

      wants and desires the good socrates professes to have asked the same

      questions and to have obtained the same answers from diotima a wise woman

      of mantinea who like agathon had spoken first of love and then of his

      works socrates like agathon had told her that love is a mighty god and

      also fair and she had shown him in return that love was neither but in a

      mean between fair and foul good and evil and not a god at all but only

      a great demon or intermediate power compare the speech of eryximachus

      who conveys to the gods the prayers of men and to men the commands of the

      gods

    


      socrates asks who are his father and mother to this diotima replies that

      he is the son of plenty and poverty and partakes of the nature of both

      and is full and starved by turns like his mother he is poor and squalid

      lying on mats at doors compare the speech of pausanias like his father

      he is bold and strong and full of arts and resources further he is in a

      mean between ignorance and knowledgein this he resembles the

      philosopher who is also in a mean between the wise and the ignorant such

      is the nature of love who is not to be confused with the beloved

    


      but love desires the beautiful and then arises the question what does he

      desire of the beautiful he desires of course the possession of the

      beautifulbut what is given by that for the beautiful let us

      substitute the good and we have no difficulty in seeing the possession of

      the good to be happiness and love to be the desire of happiness although

      the meaning of the word has been too often confined to one kind of love

      and love desires not only the good but the everlasting possession of the

      good why then is there all this flutter and excitement about love

      because all men and women at a certain age are desirous of bringing to the

      birth and love is not of beauty only but of birth in beauty this is the

      principle of immortality in a mortal creature when beauty approaches

      then the conceiving power is benign and diffuse when foulness she is

      averted and morose

    


      but why again does this extend not only to men but also to animals

      because they too have an instinct of immortality even in the same

      individual there is a perpetual succession as well of the parts of the

      material body as of the thoughts and desires of the mind nay even

      knowledge comes and goes there is no sameness of existence but the new

      mortality is always taking the place of the old this is the reason why

      parents love their childrenfor the sake of immortality and this is

      why men love the immortality of fame for the creative soul creates not

      children but conceptions of wisdom and virtue such as poets and other

      creators have invented and the noblest creations of all are those of

      legislators in honour of whom temples have been raised who would not

      sooner have these children of the mind than the ordinary human ones

      compare bacons essays certainly the best works and of

      greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or

      childless men which both in affection and means have married and endowed

      the public

    


      i will now initiate you she said into the greater mysteries for he who

      would proceed in due course should love first one fair form and then

      many and learn the connexion of them and from beautiful bodies he should

      proceed to beautiful minds and the beauty of laws and institutions until

      he perceives that all beauty is of one kindred and from institutions he

      should go on to the sciences until at last the vision is revealed to him

      of a single science of universal beauty and then he will behold the

      everlasting nature which is the cause of all and will be near the end in

      the contemplation of that supreme being of love he will be purified of

      earthly leaven and will behold beauty not with the bodily eye but with

      the eye of the mind and will bring forth true creations of virtue and

      wisdom and be the friend of god and heir of immortality

    


      such phaedrus is the tale which i heard from the stranger of mantinea

      and which you may call the encomium of love or what you please

    


      the company applaud the speech of socrates and aristophanes is about to

      say something when suddenly a band of revellers breaks into the court

      and the voice of alcibiades is heard asking for agathon he is led in

      drunk and welcomed by agathon whom he has come to crown with a garland

      he is placed on a couch at his side but suddenly on recognizing

      socrates he starts up and a sort of conflict is carried on between them

      which agathon is requested to appease alcibiades then insists that they

      shall drink and has a large winecooler filled which he first empties

      himself and then fills again and passes on to socrates he is informed of

      the nature of the entertainment and is ready to join if only in the

      character of a drunken and disappointed lover he may be allowed to sing

      the praises of socrates

    


      he begins by comparing socrates first to the busts of silenus which have

      images of the gods inside them and secondly to marsyas the

      fluteplayer for socrates produces the same effect with the voice which

      marsyas did with the flute he is the great speaker and enchanter who

      ravishes the souls of men the convincer of hearts too as he has

      convinced alcibiades and made him ashamed of his mean and miserable life

      socrates at one time seemed about to fall in love with him and he thought

      that he would thereby gain a wonderful opportunity of receiving lessons of

      wisdom he narrates the failure of his design he has suffered agonies

      from him and is at his wits end he then proceeds to mention some other

      particulars of the life of socrates how they were at potidaea together

      where socrates showed his superior powers of enduring cold and fatigue

      how on one occasion he had stood for an entire day and night absorbed in

      reflection amid the wonder of the spectators how on another occasion he

      had saved alcibiades life how at the battle of delium after the defeat

      he might be seen stalking about like a pelican rolling his eyes as

      aristophanes had described him in the clouds he is the most wonderful of

      human beings and absolutely unlike anyone but a satyr like the satyr in

      his language too for he uses the commonest words as the outward mask of

      the divinest truths

    


      when alcibiades has done speaking a dispute begins between him and

      agathon and socrates socrates piques alcibiades by a pretended affection

      for agathon presently a band of revellers appears who introduce disorder

      into the feast the sober part of the company eryximachus phaedrus and

      others withdraw and aristodemus the follower of socrates sleeps during

      the whole of a long winters night when he wakes at cockcrow the

      revellers are nearly all asleep only socrates aristophanes and agathon

      hold out they are drinking from a large goblet which they pass round

      and socrates is explaining to the two others who are halfasleep that

      the genius of tragedy is the same as that of comedy and that the writer

      of tragedy ought to be a writer of comedy also and first aristophanes

      drops and then as the day is dawning agathon socrates having laid

      them to rest takes a bath and goes to his daily avocations until the

      evening aristodemus follows

    


      

    


      if it be true that there are more things in the symposium of plato than

      any commentator has dreamed of it is also true that many things have been

      imagined which are not really to be found there some writings hardly

      admit of a more distinct interpretation than a musical composition and

      every reader may form his own accompaniment of thought or feeling to the

      strain which he hears the symposium of plato is a work of this character

      and can with difficulty be rendered in any words but the writers own

      there are so many halflights and crosslights so much of the colour of

      mythology and of the manner of sophistry adheringrhetoric and

      poetry the playful and the serious are so subtly intermingled in it and

      vestiges of old philosophy so curiously blend with germs of future

      knowledge that agreement among interpreters is not to be expected the

      expression poema magis putandum quam comicorum poetarum which has been

      applied to all the writings of plato is especially applicable to the

      symposium

    


      the power of love is represented in the symposium as running through all

      nature and all being at one end descending to animals and plants and

      attaining to the highest vision of truth at the other in an age when man

      was seeking for an expression of the world around him the conception of

      love greatly affected him one of the first distinctions of language and

      of mythology was that of gender and at a later period the ancient

      physicist anticipating modern science saw or thought that he saw a sex

      in plants there were elective affinities among the elements marriages of

      earth and heaven aesch frag dan love became a mythic personage whom

      philosophy borrowing from poetry converted into an efficient cause of

      creation the traces of the existence of love as of number and figure

      were everywhere discerned and in the pythagorean list of opposites male

      and female were ranged side by side with odd and even finite and

      infinite

    


      but plato seems also to be aware that there is a mystery of love in man as

      well as in nature extending beyond the mere immediate relation of the

      sexes he is conscious that the highest and noblest things in the world

      are not easily severed from the sensual desires or may even be regarded

      as a spiritualized form of them we may observe that socrates himself is

      not represented as originally unimpassioned but as one who has overcome

      his passions the secret of his power over others partly lies in his

      passionate but selfcontrolled nature in the phaedrus and symposium love

      is not merely the feeling usually so called but the mystical

      contemplation of the beautiful and the good the same passion which may

      wallow in the mire is capable of rising to the loftiest heightsof

      penetrating the inmost secret of philosophy the highest love is the love

      not of a person but of the highest and purest abstraction this

      abstraction is the faroff heaven on which the eye of the mind is fixed in

      fond amazement the unity of truth the consistency of the warring

      elements of the world the enthusiasm for knowledge when first beaming

      upon mankind the relativity of ideas to the human mind and of the human

      mind to ideas the faith in the invisible the adoration of the eternal

      nature are all included consciously or unconsciously in platos

      doctrine of love

    


      the successive speeches in praise of love are characteristic of the

      speakers and contribute in various degrees to the final result they are

      all designed to prepare the way for socrates who gathers up the threads

      anew and skims the highest points of each of them but they are not to be

      regarded as the stages of an idea rising above one another to a climax

      they are fanciful partly facetious performances yet also having a

      certain measure of seriousness which the successive speakers dedicate to

      the god all of them are rhetorical and poetical rather than dialectical

      but glimpses of truth appear in them when eryximachus says that the

      principles of music are simple in themselves but confused in their

      application he touches lightly upon a difficulty which has troubled the

      moderns as well as the ancients in music and may be extended to the other

      applied sciences that confusion begins in the concrete was the natural

      feeling of a mind dwelling in the world of ideas when pausanias remarks

      that personal attachments are inimical to despots the experience of greek

      history confirms the truth of his remark when aristophanes declares that

      love is the desire of the whole he expresses a feeling not unlike that of

      the german philosopher who says that philosophy is home sickness when

      agathon says that no man can be wronged of his own free will he is

      alluding playfully to a serious problem of greek philosophy compare

      arist nic ethics so naturally does plato mingle jest and earnest

      truth and opinion in the same work

    


      the charactersof phaedrus who has been the cause of more

      philosophical discussions than any other man with the exception of

      simmias the theban phaedrus of aristophanes who disguises under comic

      imagery a serious purpose of agathon who in later life is satirized by

      aristophanes in the thesmophoriazusae for his effeminate manners and the

      feeble rhythms of his verse of alcibiades who is the same strange

      contrast of great powers and great vices which meets us in historyare

      drawn to the life and we may suppose the lessknown characters of

      pausanias and eryximachus to be also true to the traditional recollection

      of them compare phaedr protag and compare sympos with phaedr we

      may also remark that aristodemus is called the little in xenophons

      memorabilia compare symp

    


      the speeches have been said to follow each other in pairs phaedrus and

      pausanias being the ethical eryximachus and aristophanes the physical

      speakers while in agathon and socrates poetry and philosophy blend

      together the speech of phaedrus is also described as the mythological

      that of pausanias as the political that of eryximachus as the scientific

      that of aristophanes as the artistic  that of socrates as the

      philosophical but these and similar distinctions are not found in platothey

      are the points of view of his critics and seem to impede rather than to

      assist us in understanding him

    


      when the turn of socrates comes round he cannot be allowed to disturb the

      arrangement made at first with the leave of phaedrus he asks a few

      questions and then he throws his argument into the form of a speech

      compare gorg protag but his speech is really the narrative of a

      dialogue between himself and diotima and as at a banquet good manners

      would not allow him to win a victory either over his host or any of the

      guests the superiority which he gains over agathon is ingeniously

      represented as having been already gained over himself by her the

      artifice has the further advantage of maintaining his accustomed

      profession of ignorance compare menex even his knowledge of the

      mysteries of love to which he lays claim here and elsewhere lys is

      given by diotima

    


      the speeches are attested to us by the very best authority the madman

      apollodorus who for three years past has made a daily study of the

      actions of socratesto whom the world is summed up in the words

      great is socrateshe has heard them from another madman

      aristodemus who was the shadow of socrates in days of old like him

      going about barefooted and who had been present at the time would you

      desire better witness the extraordinary narrative of alcibiades is

      ingeniously represented as admitted by socrates whose silence when he is

      invited to contradict gives consent to the narrator we may observe by

      the way  how the very appearance of aristodemus by himself is a

      sufficient indication to agathon that socrates has been left behind also

       how the courtesy of agathon anticipates the excuse which socrates was

      to have made on aristodemus behalf for coming uninvited  how the

      story of the fit or trance of socrates is confirmed by the mention which

      alcibiades makes of a similar fit of abstraction occurring when he was

      serving with the army at potidaea like  the drinking powers of

      socrates and his love of the fair which receive a similar attestation in

      the concluding scene or the attachment of aristodemus who is not

      forgotten when socrates takes his departure  we may notice the manner

      in which socrates himself regards the first five speeches not as true

      but as fanciful and exaggerated encomiums of the god love  the

      satirical character of them shown especially in the appeals to mythology

      in the reasons which are given by zeus for reconstructing the frame of

      man or by the boeotians and eleans for encouraging male loves  the

      ruling passion of socrates for dialectics who will argue with agathon

      instead of making a speech and will only speak at all upon the condition

      that he is allowed to speak the truth we may note also the touch of

      socratic irony  which admits of a wide application and reveals a deep

      insight into the worldthat in speaking of holy things and persons

      there is a general understanding that you should praise them not that you

      should speak the truth about themthis is the sort of praise which

      socrates is unable to give lastly  we may remark that the banquet is

      a real banquet after all at which love is the theme of discourse and

      huge quantities of wine are drunk

    


      the discourse of phaedrus is halfmythical halfethical and he himself

      true to the character which is given him in the dialogue bearing his name

      is halfsophist halfenthusiast he is the critic of poetry also who

      compares homer and aeschylus in the insipid and irrational manner of the

      schools of the day characteristically reasoning about the probability of

      matters which do not admit of reasoning he starts from a noble text

      that without the sense of honour and dishonour neither states nor

      individuals ever do any good or great work but he soon passes on to more

      commonplace topics the antiquity of love the blessing of having a

      lover the incentive which love offers to daring deeds the examples of

      alcestis and achilles are the chief themes of his discourse the love of

      women is regarded by him as almost on an equality with that of men and he

      makes the singular remark that the gods favour the return of love which is

      made by the beloved more than the original sentiment because the lover is

      of a nobler and diviner nature

    


      there is something of a sophistical ring in the speech of phaedrus which

      recalls the first speech in imitation of lysias occurring in the dialogue

      called the phaedrus this is still more marked in the speech of pausanias

      which follows and which is at once hyperlogical in form and also

      extremely confused and pedantic plato is attacking the logical feebleness

      of the sophists and rhetoricians through their pupils not forgetting by

      the way to satirize the monotonous and unmeaning rhythms which prodicus

      and others were introducing into attic prose compare protag of course

      he is playing both sides of the game as in the gorgias and phaedrus

      but it is not necessary in order to understand him that we should discuss

      the fairness of his mode of proceeding the love of pausanias for agathon

      has already been touched upon in the protagoras and is alluded to by

      aristophanes hence he is naturally the upholder of male loves which

      like all the other affections or actions of men he regards as varying

      according to the manner of their performance like the sophists and like

      plato himself though in a different sense he begins his discussion by an

      appeal to mythology and distinguishes between the elder and younger love

      the value which he attributes to such loves as motives to virtue and

      philosophy is at variance with modern and christian notions but is in

      accordance with hellenic sentiment the opinion of christendom has not

      altogether condemned passionate friendships between persons of the same

      sex but has certainly not encouraged them because though innocent in

      themselves in a few temperaments they are liable to degenerate into

      fearful evil pausanias is very earnest in the defence of such loves and

      he speaks of them as generally approved among hellenes and disapproved by

      barbarians his speech is more words than matter and might have been

      composed by a pupil of lysias or of prodicus although there is no hint

      given that plato is specially referring to them as eryximachus says he

      makes a fair beginning but a lame ending

    


      plato transposes the two next speeches as in the republic he would

      transpose the virtues and the mathematical sciences this is done partly

      to avoid monotony partly for the sake of making aristophanes the cause

      of wit in others and also in order to bring the comic and tragic poet

      into juxtaposition as if by accident a suitable expectation of

      aristophanes is raised by the ludicrous circumstance of his having the

      hiccough which is appropriately cured by his substitute the physician

      eryximachus to eryximachus love is the good physician he sees everything

      as an intelligent physicist and like many professors of his art in

      modern times attempts to reduce the moral to the physical or recognises

      one law of love which pervades them both there are loves and strifes of

      the body as well as of the mind like hippocrates the asclepiad he is a

      disciple of heracleitus whose conception of the harmony of opposites he

      explains in a new way as the harmony after discord to his common sense

      as to that of many moderns as well as ancients the identity of

      contradictories is an absurdity his notion of love may be summed up as

      the harmony of man with himself in soul as well as body and of all things

      in heaven and earth with one another

    


      aristophanes is ready to laugh and make laugh before he opens his mouth

      just as socrates true to his character is ready to argue before he

      begins to speak he expresses the very genius of the old comedy its

      coarse and forcible imagery and the licence of its language in speaking

      about the gods he has no sophistical notions about love which is brought

      back by him to its commonsense meaning of love between intelligent

      beings his account of the origin of the sexes has the greatest comic

      probability and verisimilitude nothing in aristophanes is more truly

      aristophanic than the description of the human monster whirling round on

      four arms and four legs eight in all with incredible rapidity yet there

      is a mixture of earnestness in this jest three serious principles seem to

      be insinuatedfirst that man cannot exist in isolation he must be

      reunited if he is to be perfected secondly that love is the mediator and

      reconciler of poor divided human nature thirdly that the loves of this

      world are an indistinct anticipation of an ideal union which is not yet

      realized

    


      the speech of agathon is conceived in a higher strain and receives the

      real if halfironical approval of socrates it is the speech of the

      tragic poet and a sort of poem like tragedy moving among the gods of

      olympus and not among the elder or orphic deities in the idea of the

      antiquity of love he cannot agree love is not of the olden time but

      present and youthful ever the speech may be compared with that speech of

      socrates in the phaedrus in which he describes himself as talking

      dithyrambs it is at once a preparation for socrates and a foil to him

      the rhetoric of agathon elevates the soul to sunlit heights but at the

      same time contrasts with the natural and necessary eloquence of socrates

      agathon contributes the distinction between love and the works of love

      and also hints incidentally that love is always of beauty which socrates

      afterwards raises into a principle while the consciousness of discord is

      stronger in the comic poet aristophanes agathon the tragic poet has a

      deeper sense of harmony and reconciliation and speaks of love as the

      creator and artist

    


      all the earlier speeches embody common opinions coloured with a tinge of

      philosophy they furnish the material out of which socrates proceeds to

      form his discourse starting as in other places from mythology and the

      opinions of men from phaedrus he takes the thought that love is stronger

      than death from pausanias that the true love is akin to intellect and

      political activity from eryximachus that love is a universal phenomenon

      and the great power of nature from aristophanes that love is the child

      of want and is not merely the love of the congenial or of the whole but

      as he adds of the good from agathon that love is of beauty not

      however of beauty only but of birth in beauty as it would be out of

      character for socrates to make a lengthened harangue the speech takes the

      form of a dialogue between socrates and a mysterious woman of foreign

      extraction she elicits the final truth from one who knows nothing and

      who speaking by the lips of another and himself a despiser of rhetoric

      is proved also to be the most consummate of rhetoricians compare

      menexenus

    


      the last of the six discourses begins with a short argument which

      overthrows not only agathon but all the preceding speakers by the help of

      a distinction which has escaped them extravagant praises have been

      ascribed to love as the author of every good no sort of encomium was too

      high for him whether deserved and true or not but socrates has no talent

      for speaking anything but the truth and if he is to speak the truth of

      love he must honestly confess that he is not a good at all for love is of

      the good and no man can desire that which he has this piece of

      dialectics is ascribed to diotima who has already urged upon socrates the

      argument which he urges against agathon that the distinction is a fallacy

      is obvious it is almost acknowledged to be so by socrates himself for he

      who has beauty or good may desire more of them and he who has beauty or

      good in himself may desire beauty and good in others the fallacy seems to

      arise out of a confusion between the abstract ideas of good and beauty

      which do not admit of degrees and their partial realization in

      individuals

    


      but diotima the prophetess of mantineia whose sacred and superhuman

      character raises her above the ordinary proprieties of women has taught

      socrates far more than this about the art and mystery of love she has

      taught him that love is another aspect of philosophy the same want in the

      human soul which is satisfied in the vulgar by the procreation of

      children may become the highest aspiration of intellectual desire as the

      christian might speak of hungering and thirsting after righteousness or

      of divine loves under the figure of human compare eph this is a great

      mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church as the mediaeval

      saint might speak of the fruitio dei as dante saw all things contained

      in his love of beatrice so plato would have us absorb all other loves and

      desires in the love of knowledge here is the beginning of neoplatonism

      or rather perhaps a proof of which there are many that the socalled

      mysticism of the east was not strange to the greek of the fifth century

      before christ the first tumult of the affections was not wholly subdued

      there were longings of a creature moving about in worlds not realized

      which no art could satisfy to most men reason and passion appear to be

      antagonistic both in idea and fact the union of the greatest

      comprehension of knowledge and the burning intensity of love is a

      contradiction in nature which may have existed in a faroff primeval age

      in the mind of some hebrew prophet or other eastern sage but has now

      become an imagination only yet this passion of the reason is the theme

      of the symposium of plato and as there is no impossibility in supposing

      that one king or son of a king may be a philosopher so also there is

      a probability that there may be some fewperhaps one or two in a

      whole generationin whom the light of truth may not lack the warmth

      of desire and if there be such natures no one will be disposed to deny

      that from them flow most of the benefits of individuals and states and

      even from imperfect combinations of the two elements in teachers or

      statesmen great good may often arise

    


      yet there is a higher region in which love is not only felt but

      satisfied in the perfect beauty of eternal knowledge beginning with the

      beauty of earthly things and at last reaching a beauty in which all

      existence is seen to be harmonious and one the limited affection is

      enlarged and enabled to behold the ideal of all things and here the

      highest summit which is reached in the symposium is seen also to be the

      highest summit which is attained in the republic but approached from

      another side and there is a way upwards and downwards which is the

      same and not the same in both the ideal beauty of the one is the ideal

      good of the other regarded not with the eye of knowledge but of faith

      and desire and they are respectively the source of beauty and the source

      of good in all other things and by the steps of a ladder reaching to

      heaven we pass from images of visible beauty greek and from the

      hypotheses of the mathematical sciences which are not yet based upon the

      idea of good through the concrete to the abstract and by different

      paths arriving behold the vision of the eternal compare symp greek

      republic greek also phaedrus under one aspect the idea is love

      under another truth in both the lover of wisdom is the spectator of

      all time and of all existence this is a mystery in which plato also

      obscurely intimates the union of the spiritual and fleshly the

      interpenetration of the moral and intellectual faculties

    


      the divine image of beauty which resides within socrates has been

      revealed the silenus or outward man has now to be exhibited the

      description of socrates follows immediately after the speech of socrates

      one is the complement of the other at the height of divine inspiration

      when the force of nature can no further go by way of contrast to this

      extreme idealism alcibiades accompanied by a troop of revellers and a

      flutegirl staggers in and being drunk is able to tell of things which

      he would have been ashamed to make known if he had been sober the state

      of his affections towards socrates unintelligible to us and perverted as

      they appear affords an illustration of the power ascribed to the loves of

      man in the speech of pausanias he does not suppose his feelings to be

      peculiar to himself there are several other persons in the company who

      have been equally in love with socrates and like himself have been

      deceived by him the singular part of this confession is the combination

      of the most degrading passion with the desire of virtue and improvement

      such an union is not wholly untrue to human nature which is capable of

      combining good and evil in a degree beyond what we can easily conceive in

      imaginative persons especially the god and beast in man seem to part

      asunder more than is natural in a wellregulated mind the platonic

      socrates for of the real socrates this may be doubted compare his public

      rebuke of critias for his shameful love of euthydemus in xenophon

      memorabilia does not regard the greatest evil of greek life as a thing

      not to be spoken of but it has a ridiculous element platos symp and

      is a subject for irony no less than for moral reprobation compare

      platos symp it is also used as a figure of speech which no one

      interpreted literally compare xen symp nor does plato feel any

      repugnance such as would be felt in modern times at bringing his great

      master and hero into connexion with nameless crimes he is contented with

      representing him as a saint who has won the olympian victory over the

      temptations of human nature the fault of taste which to us is so glaring

      and which was recognized by the greeks of a later age athenaeus was not

      perceived by plato himself we are still more surprised to find that the

      philosopher is incited to take the first step in his upward progress

      symp by the beauty of young men and boys which was alone capable of

      inspiring the modern feeling of romance in the greek mind the passion of

      love took the spurious form of an enthusiasm for the ideal of beautya

      worship as of some godlike image of an apollo or antinous but the love of

      youth when not depraved was a love of virtue and modesty as well as of

      beauty the one being the expression of the other and in certain greek

      states especially at sparta and thebes the honourable attachment of a

      youth to an elder man was a part of his education the army of lovers and

      their beloved who would be invincible if they could be united by such a

      tie symp is not a mere fiction of platos but seems actually to have

      existed at thebes in the days of epaminondas and pelopidas if we may

      believe writers cited anonymously by plutarch pelop vit it is

      observable that plato never in the least degree excuses the depraved love

      of the body compare charm rep laws symp and once more xenophon

      mem nor is there any greek writer of mark who condones or approves such

      connexions but owing partly to the puzzling nature of the subject these

      friendships are spoken of by plato in a manner different from that

      customary among ourselves to most of them we should hesitate to ascribe

      any more than to the attachment of achilles and patroclus in homer an

      immoral or licentious character there were many doubtless to whom the

      love of the fair mind was the noblest form of friendship rep and who

      deemed the friendship of man with man to be higher than the love of woman

      because altogether separated from the bodily appetites the existence of

      such attachments may be reasonably attributed to the inferiority and

      seclusion of woman and the want of a real family or social life and

      parental influence in hellenic cities and they were encouraged by the

      practice of gymnastic exercises by the meetings of political clubs and

      by the tie of military companionship they were also an educational

      institution a young person was specially entrusted by his parents to some

      elder friend who was expected by them to train their son in manly

      exercises and in virtue it is not likely that a greek parent committed

      him to a lover any more than we should to a schoolmaster in the

      expectation that he would be corrupted by him but rather in the hope that

      his morals would be better cared for than was possible in a great

      household of slaves

    


      it is difficult to adduce the authority of plato either for or against

      such practices or customs because it is not always easy to determine

      whether he is speaking of the heavenly and philosophical love or of the

      coarse polyhymnia and he often refers to this eg in the symposium

      half in jest yet with a certain degree of seriousness we observe that

      they entered into one part of greek literature but not into another and

      that the larger part is free from such associations indecency was an

      element of the ludicrous in the old greek comedy as it has been in other

      ages and countries but effeminate love was always condemned as well as

      ridiculed by the comic poets and in the new comedy the allusions to such

      topics have disappeared they seem to have been no longer tolerated by the

      greater refinement of the age false sentiment is found in the lyric and

      elegiac poets and in mythology the greatest of the gods rep is not

      exempt from evil imputations but the morals of a nation are not to be

      judged of wholly by its literature hellas was not necessarily more

      corrupted in the days of the persian and peloponnesian wars or of plato

      and the orators than england in the time of fielding and smollett or

      france in the nineteenth century no one supposes certain french novels to

      be a representation of ordinary french life and the greater part of greek

      literature beginning with homer and including the tragedians

      philosophers and with the exception of the comic poets whose business

      was to raise a laugh by whatever means all the greater writers of hellas

      who have been preserved to us are free from the taint of indecency

    


      some general considerations occur to our mind when we begin to reflect on

      this subject  that good and evil are linked together in human nature

      and have often existed side by side in the world and in man to an extent

      hardly credible we cannot distinguish them and are therefore unable to

      part them as in the parable they grow together unto the harvest it is

      only a rule of external decency by which society can divide them nor

      should we be right in inferring from the prevalence of any one vice or

      corruption that a state or individual was demoralized in their whole

      character not only has the corruption of the best been sometimes thought

      to be the worst but it may be remarked that this very excess of evil has

      been the stimulus to good compare plato laws where he says that in the

      most corrupt cities individuals are to be found beyond all praise  it

      may be observed that evils which admit of degrees can seldom be rightly

      estimated because under the same name actions of the most different

      degrees of culpability may be included no charge is more easily set going

      than the imputation of secret wickedness which cannot be either proved or

      disproved and often cannot be defined when directed against a person of

      whom the world or a section of it is predisposed to think evil and it

      is quite possible that the malignity of greek scandal aroused by some

      personal jealousy or party enmity may have converted the innocent

      friendship of a great man for a noble youth into a connexion of another

      kind such accusations were brought against several of the leading men of

      hellas eg cimon alcibiades critias demosthenes epaminondas several

      of the roman emperors were assailed by similar weapons which have been

      used even in our own day against statesmen of the highest character 

      while we know that in this matter there is a great gulf fixed between

      greek and christian ethics yet if we would do justice to the greeks we

      must also acknowledge that there was a greater outspokenness among them

      than among ourselves about the things which nature hides and that the

      more frequent mention of such topics is not to be taken as the measure of

      the prevalence of offences or as a proof of the general corruption of

      society it is likely that every religion in the world has used words or

      practised rites in one age which have become distasteful or repugnant to

      another we cannot though for different reasons trust the

      representations either of comedy or satire and still less of christian

      apologists  we observe that at thebes and lacedemon the attachment of

      an elder friend to a beloved youth was often deemed to be a part of his

      education and was encouraged by his parentsit was only shameful if

      it degenerated into licentiousness such we may believe to have been the

      tie which united asophychus and cephisodorus with the great epaminondas in

      whose companionship they fell plutarch amat athenaeus on the authority

      of theopompus  a small matter there appears to be a difference of

      custom among the greeks and among ourselves as between ourselves and

      continental nations at the present time in modes of salutation we must

      not suspect evil in the hearty kiss or embrace of a male friend returning

      from the army at potidaea any more than in a similar salutation when

      practised by members of the same family but those who make these

      admissions and who regard not without pity the victims of such

      illusions in our own day whose life has been blasted by them may be none

      the less resolved that the natural and healthy instincts of mankind shall

      alone be tolerated greek and that the lesson of manliness which we have

      inherited from our fathers shall not degenerate into sentimentalism or

      effeminacy the possibility of an honourable connexion of this kind seems

      to have died out with greek civilization among the romans and also among

      barbarians such as the celts and persians there is no trace of such

      attachments existing in any noble or virtuous form

      the character of alcibiades in the symposium is hardly less remarkable

      than that of socrates and agrees with the picture given of him in the

      first of the two dialogues which are called by his name and also with the

      slight sketch of him in the protagoras he is the impersonation of

      lawlessnessthe lions whelp who ought not to be reared in the

      city yet not without a certain generosity which gained the hearts of

      menstrangely fascinated by socrates and possessed of a genius

      which might have been either the destruction or salvation of athens the

      dramatic interest of the character is heightened by the recollection of

      his after history he seems to have been present to the mind of plato in

      the description of the democratic man of the republic compare also

      alcibiades 

    


      there is no criterion of the date of the symposium except that which is

      furnished by the allusion to the division of arcadia after the destruction

      of mantinea this took place in the year bc  which is the

      fortyfourth year of platos life the symposium cannot therefore be

      regarded as a youthful work as mantinea was restored in the year  the

      composition of the dialogue will probably fall between  and 

      whether the recollection of the event is more likely to have been renewed

      at the destruction or restoration of the city rather than at some

      intermediate period is a consideration not worth raising

    


      the symposium is connected with the phaedrus both in style and subject

      they are the only dialogues of plato in which the theme of love is

      discussed at length in both of them philosophy is regarded as a sort of

      enthusiasm or madness socrates is himself a prophet new inspired with

      bacchanalian revelry which like his philosophy he characteristically

      pretends to have derived not from himself but from others the phaedo also

      presents some points of comparison with the symposium for there too

      philosophy might be described as dying for love and there are not

      wanting many touches of humour and fancy which remind us of the

      symposium but while the phaedo and phaedrus look backwards and forwards

      to past and future states of existence in the symposium there is no break

      between this world and another and we rise from one to the other by a

      regular series of steps or stages proceeding from the particulars of

      sense to the universal of reason and from one universal to many which

      are finally reunited in a single science compare rep at first

      immortality means only the succession of existences even knowledge comes

      and goes then follows in the language of the mysteries a higher and a

      higher degree of initiation at last we arrive at the perfect vision of

      beauty not relative or changing but eternal and absolute not bounded by

      this world or in or out of this world but an aspect of the divine

      extending over all things and having no limit of space or time this is

      the highest knowledge of which the human mind is capable plato does not

      go on to ask whether the individual is absorbed in the sea of light and

      beauty or retains his personality enough for him to have attained the

      true beauty or good without enquiring precisely into the relation in

      which human beings stood to it that the soul has such a reach of thought

      and is capable of partaking of the eternal nature seems to imply that she

      too is eternal compare phaedrus but plato does not distinguish the

      eternal in man from the eternal in the world or in god he is willing to

      rest in the contemplation of the idea which to him is the cause of all

      things rep and has no strength to go further

    


      the symposium of xenophon in which socrates describes himself as a

      pander and also discourses of the difference between sensual and

      sentimental love likewise offers several interesting points of

      comparison but the suspicion which hangs over other writings of xenophon

      and the numerous minute references to the phaedrus and symposium as well

      as to some of the other writings of plato throw a doubt on the

      genuineness of the work the symposium of xenophon if written by him at

      all would certainly show that he wrote against plato and was acquainted

      with his works of this hostility there is no trace in the memorabilia

      such a rivalry is more characteristic of an imitator than of an original

      writer the socalled symposium of xenophon may therefore have no more

      title to be regarded as genuine than the confessedly spurious apology

    


      there are no means of determining the relative order in time of the

      phaedrus symposium phaedo the order which has been adopted in this

      translation rests on no other principle than the desire to bring together

      in a series the memorials of the life of socrates

    


 






      symposium

    


      persons of the dialogue apollodorus who repeats to his companion the

      dialogue which he had heard from aristodemus and had already once

      narrated to glaucon phaedrus pausanias eryximachus aristophanes

      agathon socrates alcibiades a troop of revellers

    


      scene the house of agathon

    


      concerning the things about which you ask to be informed i believe that i

      am not illprepared with an answer for the day before yesterday i was

      coming from my own home at phalerum to the city and one of my

      acquaintance who had caught a sight of me from behind calling out

      playfully in the distance said apollodorus o thou phalerian probably a

      play of words on greek baldheaded man halt so i did as i was

      bid and then he said i was looking for you apollodorus only just now

      that i might ask you about the speeches in praise of love which were

      delivered by socrates alcibiades and others at agathons supper

      phoenix the son of philip told another person who told me of them his

      narrative was very indistinct but he said that you knew and i wish that

      you would give me an account of them who if not you should be the

      reporter of the words of your friend and first tell me he said were you

      present at this meeting

    


      your informant glaucon i said must have been very indistinct indeed if

      you imagine that the occasion was recent or that i could have been of the

      party

    


      why yes he replied i thought so

    


      impossible i said are you ignorant that for many years agathon has not

      resided at athens and not three have elapsed since i became acquainted

      with socrates and have made it my daily business to know all that he says

      and does there was a time when i was running about the world fancying

      myself to be well employed but i was really a most wretched being no

      better than you are now i thought that i ought to do anything rather than

      be a philosopher

    


      well he said jesting apart tell me when the meeting occurred

    


      in our boyhood i replied when agathon won the prize with his first

      tragedy on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered the

      sacrifice of victory

    


      then it must have been a long while ago he said and who told youdid

      socrates

    


      no indeed i replied but the same person who told phoenixhe was a

      little fellow who never wore any shoes aristodemus of the deme of

      cydathenaeum he had been at agathons feast and i think that in those

      days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of socrates

      moreover i have asked socrates about the truth of some parts of his

      narrative and he confirmed them then said glaucon let us have the tale

      over again is not the road to athens just made for conversation and so

      we walked and talked of the discourses on love and therefore as i said

      at first i am not illprepared to comply with your request and will have

      another rehearsal of them if you like for to speak or to hear others

      speak of philosophy always gives me the greatest pleasure to say nothing

      of the profit but when i hear another strain especially that of you rich

      men and traders such conversation displeases me and i pity you who are

      my companions because you think that you are doing something when in

      reality you are doing nothing and i dare say that you pity me in return

      whom you regard as an unhappy creature and very probably you are right

      but i certainly know of you what you only think of methere is the

      difference

    


      companion i see apollodorus that you are just the samealways

      speaking evil of yourself and of others and i do believe that you pity

      all mankind with the exception of socrates yourself first of all true

      in this to your old name which however deserved i know not how you

      acquired of apollodorus the madman for you are always raging against

      yourself and everybody but socrates

    


      apollodorus yes friend and the reason why i am said to be mad and out

      of my wits is just because i have these notions of myself and you no

      other evidence is required

    


      companion no more of that apollodorus but let me renew my request that

      you would repeat the conversation

    


      apollodorus well the tale of love was on this wisebut perhaps i

      had better begin at the beginning and endeavour to give you the exact

      words of aristodemus

    


      he said that he met socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled and as the

      sight of the sandals was unusual he asked him whither he was going that

      he had been converted into such a beau

    


      to a banquet at agathons he replied whose invitation to his sacrifice

      of victory i refused yesterday fearing a crowd but promising that i

      would come today instead and so i have put on my finery because he is

      such a fine man what say you to going with me unasked

    


      i will do as you bid me i replied

    


      follow then he said and let us demolish the proverb

    


      to the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go

    


      instead of which our proverb will run

    


      to the feasts of the good the good unbidden go

    


      and this alteration may be supported by the authority of homer himself

      who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb for after

      picturing agamemnon as the most valiant of men he makes menelaus who is

      but a fainthearted warrior come unbidden iliad to the banquet of

      agamemnon who is feasting and offering sacrifices not the better to the

      worse but the worse to the better

    


      i rather fear socrates said aristodemus lest this may still be my case

      and that like menelaus in homer i shall be the inferior person who

    


      to the feasts of the wise unbidden goes

    


      but i shall say that i was bidden of you and then you will have to make

      an excuse

    


      two going together

    


      he replied in homeric fashion one or other of them may invent an excuse

      by the way iliad

    


      this was the style of their conversation as they went along socrates

      dropped behind in a fit of abstraction and desired aristodemus who was

      waiting to go on before him when he reached the house of agathon he

      found the doors wide open and a comical thing happened a servant coming

      out met him and led him at once into the banquetinghall in which the

      guests were reclining for the banquet was about to begin welcome

      aristodemus said agathon as soon as he appearedyou are just in

      time to sup with us if you come on any other matter put it off and make

      one of us as i was looking for you yesterday and meant to have asked you

      if i could have found you but what have you done with socrates

    


      i turned round but socrates was nowhere to be seen and i had to explain

      that he had been with me a moment before and that i came by his

      invitation to the supper

    


      you were quite right in coming said agathon but where is he himself

    


      he was behind me just now as i entered he said and i cannot think what

      has become of him

    


      go and look for him boy said agathon and bring him in and do you

      aristodemus meanwhile take the place by eryximachus

    


      the servant then assisted him to wash and he lay down and presently

      another servant came in and reported that our friend socrates had retired

      into the portico of the neighbouring house there he is fixed said he

      and when i call to him he will not stir

    


      how strange said agathon then you must call him again and keep calling

      him

    


      let him alone said my informant he has a way of stopping anywhere and

      losing himself without any reason i believe that he will soon appear do

      not therefore disturb him

    


      well if you think so i will leave him said agathon and then turning

      to the servants he added let us have supper without waiting for him

      serve up whatever you please for there is no one to give you orders

      hitherto i have never left you to yourselves but on this occasion imagine

      that you are our hosts and that i and the company are your guests treat

      us well and then we shall commend you after this supper was served

      but still no socrates and during the meal agathon several times expressed

      a wish to send for him but aristodemus objected and at last when the

      feast was about half overfor the fit as usual was not of long

      durationsocrates entered agathon who was reclining alone at the

      end of the table begged that he would take the place next to him that i

      may touch you he said and have the benefit of that wise thought which

      came into your mind in the portico and is now in your possession for i

      am certain that you would not have come away until you had found what you

      sought

    


      how i wish said socrates taking his place as he was desired that wisdom

      could be infused by touch out of the fuller into the emptier man as

      water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier one if that

      were so how greatly should i value the privilege of reclining at your

      side for you would have filled me full with a stream of wisdom plenteous

      and fair whereas my own is of a very mean and questionable sort no

      better than a dream but yours is bright and full of promise and was

      manifested forth in all the splendour of youth the day before yesterday

      in the presence of more than thirty thousand hellenes

    


      you are mocking socrates said agathon and ere long you and i will have

      to determine who bears off the palm of wisdomof this dionysus shall

      be the judge but at present you are better occupied with supper

    


      socrates took his place on the couch and supped with the rest and then

      libations were offered and after a hymn had been sung to the god and

      there had been the usual ceremonies they were about to commence drinking

      when pausanias said and now my friends how can we drink with least

      injury to ourselves i can assure you that i feel severely the effect of

      yesterdays potations and must have time to recover and i suspect that

      most of you are in the same predicament for you were of the party

      yesterday consider then how can the drinking be made easiest

    


      i entirely agree said aristophanes that we should by all means avoid

      hard drinking for i was myself one of those who were yesterday drowned in

      drink

    


      i think that you are right said eryximachus the son of acumenus but i

      should still like to hear one other person speak is agathon able to drink

      hard

    


      i am not equal to it said agathon

    


      then said eryximachus the weak heads like myself aristodemus phaedrus

      and others who never can drink are fortunate in finding that the stronger

      ones are not in a drinking mood i do not include socrates who is able

      either to drink or to abstain and will not mind whichever we do well

      as of none of the company seem disposed to drink much i may be forgiven

      for saying as a physician that drinking deep is a bad practice which i

      never follow if i can help and certainly do not recommend to another

      least of all to any one who still feels the effects of yesterdays

      carouse

    


      i always do what you advise and especially what you prescribe as a

      physician rejoined phaedrus the myrrhinusian and the rest of the

      company if they are wise will do the same

    


      it was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day but that

      they were all to drink only so much as they pleased

    


      then said eryximachus as you are all agreed that drinking is to be

      voluntary and that there is to be no compulsion i move in the next

      place that the flutegirl who has just made her appearance be told to

      go away and play to herself or if she likes to the women who are within

      compare prot today let us have conversation instead and if you will

      allow me i will tell you what sort of conversation this proposal having

      been accepted eryximachus proceeded as follows

    


      i will begin he said after the manner of melanippe in euripides

    


      not mine the word

    


      which i am about to speak but that of phaedrus for often he says to me

      in an indignant tonewhat a strange thing it is eryximachus

      that whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in their honour the

      great and glorious god love has no encomiast among all the poets who are

      so many there are the worthy sophists toothe excellent prodicus

      for example who have descanted in prose on the virtues of heracles and

      other heroes and what is still more extraordinary i have met with a

      philosophical work in which the utility of salt has been made the theme of

      an eloquent discourse and many other like things have had a like honour

      bestowed upon them and only to think that there should have been an eager

      interest created about them and yet that to this day no one has ever

      dared worthily to hymn loves praises so entirely has this great deity

      been neglected now in this phaedrus seems to me to be quite right and

      therefore i want to offer him a contribution also i think that at the

      present moment we who are here assembled cannot do better than honour the

      god love if you agree with me there will be no lack of conversation for

      i mean to propose that each of us in turn going from left to right shall

      make a speech in honour of love let him give us the best which he can

      and phaedrus because he is sitting first on the left hand and because he

      is the father of the thought shall begin

    


      no one will vote against you eryximachus said socrates how can i oppose

      your motion who profess to understand nothing but matters of love nor i

      presume will agathon and pausanias and there can be no doubt of

      aristophanes whose whole concern is with dionysus and aphrodite nor will

      any one disagree of those whom i see around me the proposal as i am

      aware may seem rather hard upon us whose place is last but we shall be

      contented if we hear some good speeches first let phaedrus begin the

      praise of love and good luck to him all the company expressed their

      assent and desired him to do as socrates bade him

    


      aristodemus did not recollect all that was said nor do i recollect all

      that he related to me but i will tell you what i thought most worthy of

      remembrance and what the chief speakers said

    


      phaedrus began by affirming that love is a mighty god and wonderful among

      gods and men but especially wonderful in his birth for he is the eldest

      of the gods which is an honour to him and a proof of his claim to this

      honour is that of his parents there is no memorial neither poet nor

      prosewriter has ever affirmed that he had any as hesiod says

    


      first chaos came and then broadbosomed earth the everlasting seat of

      all that is and love

    


      in other words after chaos the earth and love these two came into

      being also parmenides sings of generation

    


      first in the train of gods he fashioned love

    


      and acusilaus agrees with hesiod thus numerous are the witnesses who

      acknowledge love to be the eldest of the gods and not only is he the

      eldest he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us for i know

      not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than a

      virtuous lover or to the lover than a beloved youth for the principle

      which ought to be the guide of men who would nobly livethat

      principle i say neither kindred nor honour nor wealth nor any other

      motive is able to implant so well as love of what am i speaking of the

      sense of honour and dishonour without which neither states nor

      individuals ever do any good or great work and i say that a lover who is

      detected in doing any dishonourable act or submitting through cowardice

      when any dishonour is done to him by another will be more pained at being

      detected by his beloved than at being seen by his father or by his

      companions or by any one else the beloved too when he is found in any

      disgraceful situation has the same feeling about his lover and if there

      were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up

      of lovers and their loves compare rep they would be the very best

      governors of their own city abstaining from all dishonour and emulating

      one another in honour and when fighting at each others side although a

      mere handful they would overcome the world for what lover would not

      choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved either when

      abandoning his post or throwing away his arms he would be ready to die a

      thousand deaths rather than endure this or who would desert his beloved

      or fail him in the hour of danger the veriest coward would become an

      inspired hero equal to the bravest at such a time love would inspire

      him that courage which as homer says the god breathes into the souls of

      some heroes love of his own nature infuses into the lover

    


      love will make men dare to die for their belovedlove alone and

      women as well as men of this alcestis the daughter of pelias is a

      monument to all hellas for she was willing to lay down her life on behalf

      of her husband when no one else would although he had a father and

      mother but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded theirs that she

      made them seem to be strangers in blood to their own son and in name only

      related to him and so noble did this action of hers appear to the gods

      as well as to men that among the many who have done virtuously she is one

      of the very few to whom in admiration of her noble action they have

      granted the privilege of returning alive to earth such exceeding honour

      is paid by the gods to the devotion and virtue of love but orpheus the

      son of oeagrus the harper they sent empty away and presented to him an

      apparition only of her whom he sought but herself they would not give up

      because he showed no spirit he was only a harpplayer and did not dare

      like alcestis to die for love but was contriving how he might enter hades

      alive moreover they afterwards caused him to suffer death at the hands

      of women as the punishment of his cowardliness very different was the

      reward of the true love of achilles towards his lover patroclushis

      lover and not his love the notion that patroclus was the beloved one is a

      foolish error into which aeschylus has fallen for achilles was surely the

      fairer of the two fairer also than all the other heroes and as homer

      informs us he was still beardless and younger far and greatly as the

      gods honour the virtue of love still the return of love on the part of

      the beloved to the lover is more admired and valued and rewarded by them

      for the lover is more divine because he is inspired by god now achilles

      was quite aware for he had been told by his mother that he might avoid

      death and return home and live to a good old age if he abstained from

      slaying hector nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend and

      dared to die not only in his defence but after he was dead wherefore

      the gods honoured him even above alcestis and sent him to the islands of

      the blest these are my reasons for affirming that love is the eldest and

      noblest and mightiest of the gods and the chiefest author and giver of

      virtue in life and of happiness after death

    


      this or something like this was the speech of phaedrus and some other

      speeches followed which aristodemus did not remember the next which he

      repeated was that of pausanias phaedrus he said the argument has not

      been set before us i think quite in the right formwe should not

      be called upon to praise love in such an indiscriminate manner if there

      were only one love then what you said would be well enough but since

      there are more loves than oneshould have begun by determining

      which of them was to be the theme of our praises i will amend this

      defect and first of all i will tell you which love is deserving of

      praise and then try to hymn the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of

      him for we all know that love is inseparable from aphrodite and if there

      were only one aphrodite there would be only one love but as there are two

      goddesses there must be two loves and am i not right in asserting that

      there are two goddesses the elder one having no mother who is called

      the heavenly aphroditeshe is the daughter of uranus the younger

      who is the daughter of zeus and dioneher we call common and the

      love who is her fellowworker is rightly named common as the other love

      is called heavenly all the gods ought to have praise given to them but

      not without distinction of their natures and therefore i must try to

      distinguish the characters of the two loves now actions vary according to

      the manner of their performance take for example that which we are now

      doing drinking singing and talkingthese actions are not in

      themselves either good or evil but they turn out in this or that way

      according to the mode of performing them and when well done they are

      good and when wrongly done they are evil and in like manner not every

      love but only that which has a noble purpose is noble and worthy of

      praise the love who is the offspring of the common aphrodite is

      essentially common and has no discrimination being such as the meaner

      sort of men feel and is apt to be of women as well as of youths and is

      of the body rather than of the soulthe most foolish beings are the

      objects of this love which desires only to gain an end but never thinks

      of accomplishing the end nobly and therefore does good and evil quite

      indiscriminately the goddess who is his mother is far younger than the

      other and she was born of the union of the male and female and partakes

      of both but the offspring of the heavenly aphrodite is derived from a

      mother in whose birth the female has no partshe is from the male

      only this is that love which is of youths and the goddess being older

      there is nothing of wantonness in her those who are inspired by this love

      turn to the male and delight in him who is the more valiant and

      intelligent nature any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts in the very

      character of their attachments for they love not boys but intelligent

      beings whose reason is beginning to be developed much about the time at

      which their beards begin to grow and in choosing young men to be their

      companions they mean to be faithful to them and pass their whole life in

      company with them not to take them in their inexperience and deceive

      them and play the fool with them or run away from one to another of

      them but the love of young boys should be forbidden by law because their

      future is uncertain they may turn out good or bad either in body or

      soul and much noble enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them in this

      matter the good are a law to themselves and the coarser sort of lovers

      ought to be restrained by force as we restrain or attempt to restrain

      them from fixing their affections on women of free birth these are the

      persons who bring a reproach on love and some have been led to deny the

      lawfulness of such attachments because they see the impropriety and evil

      of them for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfully done can

      justly be censured now here and in lacedaemon the rules about love are

      perplexing but in most cities they are simple and easily intelligible in

      elis and boeotia and in countries having no gifts of eloquence they are

      very straightforward the law is simply in favour of these connexions and

      no one whether young or old has anything to say to their discredit the

      reason being as i suppose that they are men of few words in those parts

      and therefore the lovers do not like the trouble of pleading their suit

      in ionia and other places and generally in countries which are subject to

      the barbarians the custom is held to be dishonourable loves of youths

      share the evil repute in which philosophy and gymnastics are held because

      they are inimical to tyranny for the interests of rulers require that

      their subjects should be poor in spirit compare arist politics and

      that there should be no strong bond of friendship or society among them

      which love above all other motives is likely to inspire as our athenian

      tyrants learned by experience for the love of aristogeiton and the

      constancy of harmodius had a strength which undid their power and

      therefore the illrepute into which these attachments have fallen is to

      be ascribed to the evil condition of those who make them to be

      illreputed that is to say to the selfseeking of the governors and the

      cowardice of the governed on the other hand the indiscriminate honour

      which is given to them in some countries is attributable to the laziness

      of those who hold this opinion of them in our own country a far better

      principle prevails but as i was saying the explanation of it is rather

      perplexing for observe that open loves are held to be more honourable

      than secret ones and that the love of the noblest and highest even if

      their persons are less beautiful than others is especially honourable

      consider too how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to

      the lover neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable but

      if he succeeds he is praised and if he fail he is blamed and in the

      pursuit of his love the custom of mankind allows him to do many strange

      things which philosophy would bitterly censure if they were done from any

      motive of interest or wish for office or power he may pray and entreat

      and supplicate and swear and lie on a mat at the door and endure a

      slavery worse than that of any slavein any other case friends and

      enemies would be equally ready to prevent him but now there is no friend

      who will be ashamed of him and admonish him and no enemy will charge him

      with meanness or flattery the actions of a lover have a grace which

      ennobles them and custom has decided that they are highly commendable and

      that there no loss of character in them and what is strangest of all he

      only may swear and forswear himself so men say and the gods will

      forgive his transgression for there is no such thing as a lovers oath

      such is the entire liberty which gods and men have allowed the lover

      according to the custom which prevails in our part of the world from this

      point of view a man fairly argues that in athens to love and to be loved

      is held to be a very honourable thing but when parents forbid their sons

      to talk with their lovers and place them under a tutors care who is

      appointed to see to these things and their companions and equals cast in

      their teeth anything of the sort which they may observe and their elders

      refuse to silence the reprovers and do not rebuke themany one who

      reflects on all this will on the contrary think that we hold these

      practices to be most disgraceful but as i was saying at first the truth

      as i imagine is that whether such practices are honourable or whether

      they are dishonourable is not a simple question they are honourable to

      him who follows them honourably dishonourable to him who follows them

      dishonourably there is dishonour in yielding to the evil or in an evil

      manner but there is honour in yielding to the good or in an honourable

      manner evil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul

      inasmuch as he is not even stable because he loves a thing which is in

      itself unstable and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was

      desiring is over he takes wing and flies away in spite of all his words

      and promises whereas the love of the noble disposition is lifelong for

      it becomes one with the everlasting the custom of our country would have

      both of them proven well and truly and would have us yield to the one

      sort of lover and avoid the other and therefore encourages some to

      pursue and others to fly testing both the lover and beloved in contests

      and trials until they show to which of the two classes they respectively

      belong and this is the reason why in the first place a hasty attachment

      is held to be dishonourable because time is the true test of this as of

      most other things and secondly there is a dishonour in being overcome by

      the love of money or of wealth or of political power whether a man is

      frightened into surrender by the loss of them or having experienced the

      benefits of money and political corruption is unable to rise above the

      seductions of them for none of these things are of a permanent or lasting

      nature not to mention that no generous friendship ever sprang from them

      there remains then only one way of honourable attachment which custom

      allows in the beloved and this is the way of virtue for as we admitted

      that any service which the lover does to him is not to be accounted

      flattery or a dishonour to himself so the beloved has one way only of

      voluntary service which is not dishonourable and this is virtuous

      service

    


      for we have a custom and according to our custom any one who does service

      to another under the idea that he will be improved by him either in

      wisdom or in some other particular of virtuesuch a voluntary

      service i say is not to be regarded as a dishonour and is not open to

      the charge of flattery and these two customs one the love of youth and

      the other the practice of philosophy and virtue in general ought to meet

      in one and then the beloved may honourably indulge the lover for when

      the lover and beloved come together having each of them a law and the

      lover thinks that he is right in doing any service which he can to his

      gracious loving one and the other that he is right in showing any

      kindness which he can to him who is making him wise and good the one

      capable of communicating wisdom and virtue the other seeking to acquire

      them with a view to education and wisdom when the two laws of love are

      fulfilled and meet in onethen and then only may the beloved yield

      with honour to the lover nor when love is of this disinterested sort is

      there any disgrace in being deceived but in every other case there is

      equal disgrace in being or not being deceived for he who is gracious to

      his lover under the impression that he is rich and is disappointed of his

      gains because he turns out to be poor is disgraced all the same for he

      has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any ones uses

      base for the sake of money but this is not honourable and on the same

      principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is a good man and in

      the hope that he will be improved by his company shows himself to be

      virtuous even though the object of his affection turn out to be a

      villain and to have no virtue and if he is deceived he has committed a

      noble error for he has proved that for his part he will do anything for

      anybody with a view to virtue and improvement than which there can be

      nothing nobler thus noble in every case is the acceptance of another for

      the sake of virtue this is that love which is the love of the heavenly

      godess and is heavenly and of great price to individuals and cities

      making the lover and the beloved alike eager in the work of their own

      improvement but all other loves are the offspring of the other who is

      the common goddess to you phaedrus i offer this my contribution in

      praise of love which is as good as i could make extempore

    


      pausanias came to a pausethis is the balanced way in which i have

      been taught by the wise to speak and aristodemus said that the turn of

      aristophanes was next but either he had eaten too much or from some

      other cause he had the hiccough and was obliged to change turns with

      eryximachus the physician who was reclining on the couch below him

      eryximachus he said you ought either to stop my hiccough or to speak in

      my turn until i have left off

    


      i will do both said eryximachus i will speak in your turn and do you

      speak in mine and while i am speaking let me recommend you to hold your

      breath and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough is no

      better then gargle with a little water and if it still continues tickle

      your nose with something and sneeze and if you sneeze once or twice even

      the most violent hiccough is sure to go i will do as you prescribe said

      aristophanes and now get on

    


      eryximachus spoke as follows seeing that pausanias made a fair beginning

      and but a lame ending i must endeavour to supply his deficiency i think

      that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of love but my art further

      informs me that the double love is not merely an affection of the soul of

      man towards the fair or towards anything but is to be found in the

      bodies of all animals and in productions of the earth and i may say in

      all that is such is the conclusion which i seem to have gathered from my

      own art of medicine whence i learn how great and wonderful and universal

      is the deity of love whose empire extends over all things divine as well

      as human and from medicine i will begin that i may do honour to my art

      there are in the human body these two kinds of love which are confessedly

      different and unlike and being unlike they have loves and desires which

      are unlike and the desire of the healthy is one and the desire of the

      diseased is another and as pausanias was just now saying that to indulge

      good men is honourable and bad men dishonourableso too in the

      body the good and healthy elements are to be indulged and the bad

      elements and the elements of disease are not to be indulged but

      discouraged and this is what the physician has to do and in this the art

      of medicine consists for medicine may be regarded generally as the

      knowledge of the loves and desires of the body and how to satisfy them or

      not and the best physician is he who is able to separate fair love from

      foul or to convert one into the other and he who knows how to eradicate

      and how to implant love whichever is required and can reconcile the most

      hostile elements in the constitution and make them loving friends is a

      skilful practitioner now the most hostile are the most opposite such as

      hot and cold bitter and sweet moist and dry and the like and my

      ancestor asclepius knowing how to implant friendship and accord in these

      elements was the creator of our art as our friends the poets here tell

      us and i believe them and not only medicine in every branch but the arts

      of gymnastic and husbandry are under his dominion any one who pays the

      least attention to the subject will also perceive that in music there is

      the same reconciliation of opposites and i suppose that this must have

      been the meaning of heracleitus although his words are not accurate for

      he says that the one is united by disunion like the harmony of the bow

      and the lyre now there is an absurdity saying that harmony is discord or

      is composed of elements which are still in a state of discord but what he

      probably meant was that harmony is composed of differing notes of higher

      or lower pitch which disagreed once but are now reconciled by the art of

      music for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed there could be

      no harmonyclearly not for harmony is a symphony and symphony is

      an agreement but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there

      cannot be you cannot harmonize that which disagrees in like manner

      rhythm is compounded of elements short and long once differing and now in

      accord which accordance as in the former instance medicine so in all

      these other cases music implants making love and unison to grow up among

      them and thus music too is concerned with the principles of love in

      their application to harmony and rhythm again in the essential nature of

      harmony and rhythm there is no difficulty in discerning love which has not

      yet become double but when you want to use them in actual life either in

      the composition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metres

      composed already which latter is called education then the difficulty

      begins and the good artist is needed then the old tale has to be

      repeated of fair and heavenly lovethe love of urania the fair and

      heavenly muse and of the duty of accepting the temperate and those who

      are as yet intemperate only that they may become temperate and of

      preserving their love and again of the vulgar polyhymnia who must be

      used with circumspection that the pleasure be enjoyed but may not

      generate licentiousness just as in my own art it is a great matter so to

      regulate the desires of the epicure that he may gratify his tastes without

      the attendant evil of disease whence i infer that in music in medicine

      in all other things human as well as divine both loves ought to be noted

      as far as may be for they are both present

    


      the course of the seasons is also full of both these principles and when

      as i was saying the elements of hot and cold moist and dry attain the

      harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance and harmony they

      bring to men animals and plants health and plenty and do them no harm

      whereas the wanton love getting the upper hand and affecting the seasons

      of the year is very destructive and injurious being the source of

      pestilence and bringing many other kinds of diseases on animals and

      plants for hoarfrost and hail and blight spring from the excesses and

      disorders of these elements of love which to know in relation to the

      revolutions of the heavenly bodies and the seasons of the year is termed

      astronomy furthermore all sacrifices and the whole province of

      divination which is the art of communion between gods and menthese

      i say are concerned only with the preservation of the good and the cure

      of the evil love for all manner of impiety is likely to ensue if instead

      of accepting and honouring and reverencing the harmonious love in all his

      actions a man honours the other love whether in his feelings towards

      gods or parents towards the living or the dead wherefore the business of

      divination is to see to these loves and to heal them and divination is

      the peacemaker of gods and men working by a knowledge of the religious or

      irreligious tendencies which exist in human loves such is the great and

      mighty or rather omnipotent force of love in general and the love more

      especially which is concerned with the good and which is perfected in

      company with temperance and justice whether among gods or men has the

      greatest power and is the source of all our happiness and harmony and

      makes us friends with the gods who are above us and with one another i

      dare say that i too have omitted several things which might be said in

      praise of love but this was not intentional and you aristophanes may

      now supply the omission or take some other line of commendation for i

      perceive that you are rid of the hiccough

    


      yes said aristophanes who followed the hiccough is gone not however

      until i applied the sneezing and i wonder whether the harmony of the body

      has a love of such noises and ticklings for i no sooner applied the

      sneezing than i was cured

    


      eryximachus said beware friend aristophanes although you are going to

      speak you are making fun of me and i shall have to watch and see whether

      i cannot have a laugh at your expense when you might speak in peace

    


      you are right said aristophanes laughing i will unsay my words but do

      you please not to watch me as i fear that in the speech which i am about

      to make instead of others laughing with me which is to the manner born

      of our muse and would be all the better i shall only be laughed at by

      them

    


      do you expect to shoot your bolt and escape aristophanes well perhaps

      if you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be called to

      account i may be induced to let you off

    


      aristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse he had a mind to

      praise love in another way unlike that either of pausanias or

      eryximachus mankind he said judging by their neglect of him have

      never as i think at all understood the power of love for if they had

      understood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars and

      offered solemn sacrifices in his honour but this is not done and most

      certainly ought to be done since of all the gods he is the best friend of

      men the helper and the healer of the ills which are the great impediment

      to the happiness of the race i will try to describe his power to you and

      you shall teach the rest of the world what i am teaching you in the first

      place let me treat of the nature of man and what has happened to it for

      the original human nature was not like the present but different the

      sexes were not two as they are now but originally three in number there

      was man woman and the union of the two having a name corresponding to

      this double nature which had once a real existence but is now lost and

      the word androgynous is only preserved as a term of reproach in the

      second place the primeval man was round his back and sides forming a

      circle and he had four hands and four feet one head with two faces

      looking opposite ways set on a round neck and precisely alike also four

      ears two privy members and the remainder to correspond he could walk

      upright as men now do backwards or forwards as he pleased and he could

      also roll over and over at a great pace turning on his four hands and

      four feet eight in all like tumblers going over and over with their legs

      in the air this was when he wanted to run fast now the sexes were three

      and such as i have described them because the sun moon and earth are

      three and the man was originally the child of the sun the woman of the

      earth and the manwoman of the moon which is made up of sun and earth

      and they were all round and moved round and round like their parents

      terrible was their might and strength and the thoughts of their hearts

      were great and they made an attack upon the gods of them is told the

      tale of otys and ephialtes who as homer says dared to scale heaven and

      would have laid hands upon the gods doubt reigned in the celestial

      councils should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts

      as they had done the giants then there would be an end of the sacrifices

      and worship which men offered to them but on the other hand the gods

      could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained at last after a good

      deal of reflection zeus discovered a way he said methinks i have a

      plan which will humble their pride and improve their manners men shall

      continue to exist but i will cut them in two and then they will be

      diminished in strength and increased in numbers this will have the

      advantage of making them more profitable to us they shall walk upright on

      two legs and if they continue insolent and will not be quiet i will

      split them again and they shall hop about on a single leg he spoke and

      cut men in two like a sorbapple which is halved for pickling or as you

      might divide an egg with a hair and as he cut them one after another he

      bade apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn in order that

      the man might contemplate the section of himself he would thus learn a

      lesson of humility apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and

      compose their forms so he gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin

      from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly

      like the purses which draw in and he made one mouth at the centre which

      he fastened in a knot the same which is called the navel he also

      moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles much as a shoemaker

      might smooth leather upon a last he left a few however in the region of

      the belly and navel as a memorial of the primeval state after the

      division the two parts of man each desiring his other half came

      together and throwing their arms about one another entwined in mutual

      embraces longing to grow into one they were on the point of dying from

      hunger and selfneglect because they did not like to do anything apart

      and when one of the halves died and the other survived the survivor

      sought another mate man or woman as we call thembeing the

      sections of entire men or womenand clung to that they were being

      destroyed when zeus in pity of them invented a new plan he turned the

      parts of generation round to the front for this had not been always their

      position and they sowed the seed no longer as hitherto like grasshoppers

      in the ground but in one another and after the transposition the male

      generated in the female in order that by the mutual embraces of man and

      woman they might breed and the race might continue or if man came to man

      they might be satisfied and rest and go their ways to the business of

      life so ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us

      reuniting our original nature making one of two and healing the state of

      man each of us when separated having one side only like a flat fish is

      but the indenture of a man and he is always looking for his other half

      men who are a section of that double nature which was once called

      androgynous are lovers of women adulterers are generally of this breed

      and also adulterous women who lust after men the women who are a section

      of the woman do not care for men but have female attachments the female

      companions are of this sort but they who are a section of the male follow

      the male and while they are young being slices of the original man they

      hang about men and embrace them and they are themselves the best of boys

      and youths because they have the most manly nature some indeed assert

      that they are shameless but this is not true for they do not act thus

      from any want of shame but because they are valiant and manly and have a

      manly countenance and they embrace that which is like them and these

      when they grow up become our statesmen and these only which is a great

      proof of the truth of what i am saving when they reach manhood they are

      lovers of youth and are not naturally inclined to marry or beget

      childrenif at all they do so only in obedience to the law but

      they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with one another

      unwedded and such a nature is prone to love and ready to return love

      always embracing that which is akin to him and when one of them meets

      with his other half the actual half of himself whether he be a lover of

      youth or a lover of another sort the pair are lost in an amazement of

      love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of the others

      sight as i may say even for a moment these are the people who pass

      their whole lives together yet they could not explain what they desire of

      one another for the intense yearning which each of them has towards the

      other does not appear to be the desire of lovers intercourse but of

      something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell

      and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment suppose

      hephaestus with his instruments to come to the pair who are lying side

      by side and to say to them what do you people want of one another they

      would be unable to explain and suppose further that when he saw their

      perplexity he said do you desire to be wholly one always day and night

      to be in one anothers company for if this is what you desire i am ready

      to melt you into one and let you grow together so that being two you

      shall become one and while you live live a common life as if you were a

      single man and after your death in the world below still be one departed

      soul instead of twoi ask whether this is what you lovingly desire

      and whether you are satisfied to attain thisthere is not a man of

      them who when he heard the proposal would deny or would not acknowledge

      that this meeting and melting into one another this becoming one instead

      of two was the very expression of his ancient need compare arist pol

      and the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a

      whole and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love there was a

      time i say when we were one but now because of the wickedness of

      mankind god has dispersed us as the arcadians were dispersed into

      villages by the lacedaemonians compare arist pol and if we are not

      obedient to the gods there is a danger that we shall be split up again

      and go about in bassorelievo like the profile figures having only half a

      nose which are sculptured on monuments and that we shall be like tallies

      wherefore let us exhort all men to piety that we may avoid evil and

      obtain the good of which love is to us the lord and minister and let no

      one oppose himhe is the enemy of the gods who opposes him for if

      we are friends of the god and at peace with him we shall find our own true

      loves which rarely happens in this world at present i am serious and

      therefore i must beg eryximachus not to make fun or to find any allusion

      in what i am saying to pausanias and agathon who as i suspect are both

      of the manly nature and belong to the class which i have been describing

      but my words have a wider applicationthey include men and women

      everywhere and i believe that if our loves were perfectly accomplished

      and each one returning to his primeval nature had his original true love

      then our race would be happy and if this would be best of all the best

      in the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearest

      approach to such an union and that will be the attainment of a congenial

      love wherefore if we would praise him who has given to us the benefit

      we must praise the god love who is our greatest benefactor both leading

      us in this life back to our own nature and giving us high hopes for the

      future for he promises that if we are pious he will restore us to our

      original state and heal us and make us happy and blessed this

      eryximachus is my discourse of love which although different to yours

      i must beg you to leave unassailed by the shafts of your ridicule in

      order that each may have his turn each or rather either for agathon and

      socrates are the only ones left

    


      indeed i am not going to attack you said eryximachus for i thought your

      speech charming and did i not know that agathon and socrates are masters

      in the art of love i should be really afraid that they would have nothing

      to say after the world of things which have been said already but for

      all that i am not without hopes

    


      socrates said you played your part well eryximachus but if you were as

      i am now or rather as i shall be when agathon has spoken you would

      indeed be in a great strait

    


      you want to cast a spell over me socrates said agathon in the hope that

      i may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the audience that i

      shall speak well

    


      i should be strangely forgetful agathon replied socrates of the courage

      and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions were about to

      be exhibited and you came upon the stage with the actors and faced the

      vast theatre altogether undismayed if i thought that your nerves could be

      fluttered at a small party of friends

    


      do you think socrates said agathon that my head is so full of the

      theatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a few

      good judges are than many fools

    


      nay replied socrates i should be very wrong in attributing to you

      agathon that or any other want of refinement and i am quite aware that

      if you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise you would care for

      their opinion much more than for that of the many but then we having

      been a part of the foolish many in the theatre cannot be regarded as the

      select wise though i know that if you chanced to be in the presence not

      of one of ourselves but of some really wise man you would be ashamed of

      disgracing yourself before himwould you not

    


      yes said agathon

    


      but before the many you would not be ashamed if you thought that you were

      doing something disgraceful in their presence

    


      here phaedrus interrupted them saying not answer him my dear agathon

      for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk especially a

      goodlooking one he will no longer care about the completion of our plan

      now i love to hear him talk but just at present i must not forget the

      encomium on love which i ought to receive from him and from every one

      when you and he have paid your tribute to the god then you may talk

    


      very good phaedrus said agathon i see no reason why i should not

      proceed with my speech as i shall have many other opportunities of

      conversing with socrates let me say first how i ought to speak and then

      speak

    


      the previous speakers instead of praising the god love or unfolding his

      nature appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits which he

      confers upon them but i would rather praise the god first and then speak

      of his gifts this is always the right way of praising everything may i

      say without impiety or offence that of all the blessed gods he is the

      most blessed because he is the fairest and best and he is the fairest

      for in the first place he is the youngest and of his youth he is

      himself the witness fleeing out of the way of age who is swift enough

      swifter truly than most of us likelove hates him and will not come

      near him but youth and love live and move togetherlike to like as

      the proverb says many things were said by phaedrus about love in which i

      agree with him but i cannot agree that he is older than iapetus and

      kronosnot so i maintain him to be the youngest of the gods and

      youthful ever the ancient doings among the gods of which hesiod and

      parmenides spoke if the tradition of them be true were done of necessity

      and not of love had love been in those days there would have been no

      chaining or mutilation of the gods or other violence but peace and

      sweetness as there is now in heaven since the rule of love began love

      is young and also tender he ought to have a poet like homer to describe

      his tenderness as homer says of ate that she is a goddess and tender

    


      her feet are tender for she sets her steps not on the ground but on the

      heads of men

    


      herein is an excellent proof of her tendernessthat she walks not

      upon the hard but upon the soft let us adduce a similar proof of the

      tenderness of love for he walks not upon the earth nor yet upon the

      skulls of men which are not so very soft but in the hearts and souls of

      both gods and men which are of all things the softest in them he walks

      and dwells and makes his home not in every soul without exception for

      where there is hardness he departs where there is softness there he

      dwells and nestling always with his feet and in all manner of ways in the

      softest of soft places how can he be other than the softest of all

      things of a truth he is the tenderest as well as the youngest and also

      he is of flexile form for if he were hard and without flexure he could

      not enfold all things or wind his way into and out of every soul of man

      undiscovered and a proof of his flexibility and symmetry of form is his

      grace which is universally admitted to be in an especial manner the

      attribute of love ungrace and love are always at war with one another

      the fairness of his complexion is revealed by his habitation among the

      flowers for he dwells not amid bloomless or fading beauties whether of

      body or soul or aught else but in the place of flowers and scents there

      he sits and abides concerning the beauty of the god i have said enough

      and yet there remains much more which i might say of his virtue i have

      now to speak his greatest glory is that he can neither do nor suffer

      wrong to or from any god or any man for he suffers not by force if he

      suffers force comes not near him neither when he acts does he act by

      force for all men in all things serve him of their own free will and

      where there is voluntary agreement there as the laws which are the lords

      of the city say is justice and not only is he just but exceedingly

      temperate for temperance is the acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and

      desires and no pleasure ever masters love he is their master and they

      are his servants and if he conquers them he must be temperate indeed as

      to courage even the god of war is no match for him he is the captive and

      love is the lord for love the love of aphrodite masters him as the

      tale runs and the master is stronger than the servant and if he conquers

      the bravest of all others he must be himself the bravest of his courage

      and justice and temperance i have spoken but i have yet to speak of his

      wisdom and according to the measure of my ability i must try to do my

      best in the first place he is a poet and here like eryximachus i

      magnify my art and he is also the source of poesy in others which he

      could not be if he were not himself a poet and at the touch of him every

      one becomes a poet even though he had no music in him before a fragment

      of the sthenoaoea of euripides this also is a proof that love is a good

      poet and accomplished in all the fine arts for no one can give to another

      that which he has not himself or teach that of which he has no knowledge

      who will deny that the creation of the animals is his doing are they not

      all the works of his wisdom born and begotten of him and as to the

      artists do we not know that he only of them whom love inspires has the

      light of famehe whom love touches not walks in darkness the arts

      of medicine and archery and divination were discovered by apollo under

      the guidance of love and desire so that he too is a disciple of love

      also the melody of the muses the metallurgy of hephaestus the weaving of

      athene the empire of zeus over gods and men are all due to love who was

      the inventor of them and so love set in order the empire of the godsthe

      love of beauty as is evident for with deformity love has no concern in

      the days of old as i began by saying dreadful deeds were done among the

      gods for they were ruled by necessity but now since the birth of love

      and from the love of the beautiful has sprung every good in heaven and

      earth therefore phaedrus i say of love that he is the fairest and best

      in himself and the cause of what is fairest and best in all other things

      and there comes into my mind a line of poetry in which he is said to be

      the god who

    


      gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep who stills the winds and

      bids the sufferer sleep

    


      this is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them with affection

      who makes them to meet together at banquets such as these in sacrifices

      feasts dances he is our lordwho sends courtesy and sends away

      discourtesy who gives kindness ever and never gives unkindness the

      friend of the good the wonder of the wise the amazement of the gods

      desired by those who have no part in him and precious to those who have

      the better part in him parent of delicacy luxury desire fondness

      softness grace regardful of the good regardless of the evil in every

      word work wish fearsaviour pilot comrade helper glory of

      gods and men leader best and brightest in whose footsteps let every man

      follow sweetly singing in his honour and joining in that sweet strain

      with which love charms the souls of gods and men such is the speech

      phaedrus halfplayful yet having a certain measure of seriousness

      which according to my ability i dedicate to the god

    


      when agathon had done speaking aristodemus said that there was a general

      cheer the young man was thought to have spoken in a manner worthy of

      himself and of the god and socrates looking at eryximachus said tell

      me son of acumenus was there not reason in my fears and was i not a

      true prophet when i said that agathon would make a wonderful oration and

      that i should be in a strait

    


      the part of the prophecy which concerns agathon replied eryximachus

      appears to me to be true but not the other partthat you will be in

      a strait

    


      why my dear friend said socrates must not i or any one be in a strait

      who has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied discourse i am

      especially struck with the beauty of the concluding wordswho could

      listen to them without amazement when i reflected on the immeasurable

      inferiority of my own powers i was ready to run away for shame if there

      had been a possibility of escape for i was reminded of gorgias and at

      the end of his speech i fancied that agathon was shaking at me the

      gorginian or gorgonian head of the great master of rhetoric which was

      simply to turn me and my speech into stone as homer says odyssey and

      strike me dumb and then i perceived how foolish i had been in consenting

      to take my turn with you in praising love and saying that i too was a

      master of the art when i really had no conception how anything ought to

      be praised for in my simplicity i imagined that the topics of praise

      should be true and that this being presupposed out of the true the

      speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in the best manner and

      i felt quite proud thinking that i knew the nature of true praise and

      should speak well whereas i now see that the intention was to attribute

      to love every species of greatness and glory whether really belonging to

      him or not without regard to truth or falsehoodthat was no matter

      for the original proposal seems to have been not that each of you should

      really praise love but only that you should appear to praise him and so

      you attribute to love every imaginable form of praise which can be

      gathered anywhere and you say that he is all this and the cause of

      all that making him appear the fairest and best of all to those who know

      him not for you cannot impose upon those who know him and a noble and

      solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed but as i misunderstood the

      nature of the praise when i said that i would take my turn i must beg to

      be absolved from the promise which i made in ignorance and which as

      euripides would say eurip hyppolytus was a promise of the lips and not

      of the mind farewell then to such a strain for i do not praise in that

      way no indeed i cannot but if you like to hear the truth about love i

      am ready to speak in my own manner though i will not make myself

      ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you say then phaedrus

      whether you would like to have the truth about love spoken in any words

      and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time will

      that be agreeable to you

    


      aristodemus said that phaedrus and the company bid him speak in any manner

      which he thought best then he added let me have your permission first

      to ask agathon a few more questions in order that i may take his

      admissions as the premisses of my discourse

    


      i grant the permission said phaedrus put your questions socrates then

      proceeded as follows

    


      in the magnificent oration which you have just uttered i think that you

      were right my dear agathon in proposing to speak of the nature of love

      first and afterwards of his worksthat is a way of beginning which i

      very much approve and as you have spoken so eloquently of his nature may

      i ask you further whether love is the love of something or of nothing

      and here i must explain myself i do not want you to say that love is the

      love of a father or the love of a motherthat would be ridiculous

      but to answer as you would if i asked is a father a father of something

      to which you would find no difficulty in replying of a son or daughter

      and the answer would be right

    


      very true said agathon

    


      and you would say the same of a mother

    


      he assented

    


      yet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my meaning is

      not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of something

    


      certainly he replied

    


      that is of a brother or sister

    


      yes he said

    


      and now said socrates i will ask about loveis love of something

      or of nothing

    


      of something surely he replied

    


      keep in mind what this is and tell me what i want to knowwhether

      love desires that of which love is

    


      yes surely

    


      and does he possess or does he not possess that which he loves and

      desires

    


      probably not i should say

    


      nay replied socrates i would have you consider whether necessarily is

      not rather the word the inference that he who desires something is in

      want of something and that he who desires nothing is in want of nothing

      is in my judgment agathon absolutely and necessarily true what do you

      think

    


      i agree with you said agathon

    


      very good would he who is great desire to be great or he who is strong

      desire to be strong

    


      that would be inconsistent with our previous admissions

    


      true for he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is

    


      very true

    


      and yet added socrates if a man being strong desired to be strong or

      being swift desired to be swift or being healthy desired to be healthy

      in that case he might be thought to desire something which he already has

      or is i give the example in order that we may avoid misconception for

      the possessors of these qualities agathon must be supposed to have their

      respective advantages at the time whether they choose or not and who can

      desire that which he has therefore when a person says i am well and

      wish to be well or i am rich and wish to be rich and i desire simply to

      have what i haveto him we shall reply you my friend having

      wealth and health and strength want to have the continuance of them for

      at this moment whether you choose or no you have them and when you say

      i desire that which i have and nothing else is not your meaning that you

      want to have what you now have in the future he must agree with usmust

      he not

    


      he must replied agathon

    


      then said socrates he desires that what he has at present may be

      preserved to him in the future which is equivalent to saying that he

      desires something which is nonexistent to him and which as yet he has

      not got

    


      very true he said

    


      then he and every one who desires desires that which he has not already

      and which is future and not present and which he has not and is not and

      of which he is in wantthese are the sort of things which love and

      desire seek

    


      very true he said

    


      then now said socrates let us recapitulate the argument first is not

      love of something and of something too which is wanting to a man

    


      yes he replied

    


      remember further what you said in your speech or if you do not remember i

      will remind you you said that the love of the beautiful set in order the

      empire of the gods for that of deformed things there is no lovedid

      you not say something of that kind

    


      yes said agathon

    


      yes my friend and the remark was a just one and if this is true love

      is the love of beauty and not of deformity

    


      he assented

    


      and the admission has been already made that love is of something which a

      man wants and has not

    


      true he said

    


      then love wants and has not beauty

    


      certainly he replied

    


      and would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess beauty

    


      certainly not

    


      then would you still say that love is beautiful

    


      agathon replied i fear that i did not understand what i was saying

    


      you made a very good speech agathon replied socrates but there is yet

      one small question which i would fain askis not the good also the

      beautiful

    


      yes

    


      then in wanting the beautiful love wants also the good

    


      i cannot refute you socrates said agathonlet us assume that what

      you say is true

    


      say rather beloved agathon that you cannot refute the truth for

      socrates is easily refuted

    


      and now taking my leave of you i would rehearse a tale of love which i

      heard from diotima of mantineia compare  alcibiades a woman wise in

      this and in many other kinds of knowledge who in the days of old when

      the athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague delayed

      the disease ten years she was my instructress in the art of love and i

      shall repeat to you what she said to me beginning with the admissions

      made by agathon which are nearly if not quite the same which i made to

      the wise woman when she questioned me i think that this will be the

      easiest way and i shall take both parts myself as well as i can compare

      gorgias as you agathon suggested supra i must speak first of the

      being and nature of love and then of his works first i said to her in

      nearly the same words which he used to me that love was a mighty god and

      likewise fair and she proved to me as i proved to him that by my own

      showing love was neither fair nor good what do you mean diotima i

      said is love then evil and foul hush she cried must that be foul

      which is not fair certainly i said and is that which is not wise

      ignorant do you not see that there is a mean between wisdom and

      ignorance and what may that be i said right opinion she replied

      which as you know being incapable of giving a reason is not knowledge

      for how can knowledge be devoid of reason nor again ignorance for

      neither can ignorance attain the truth but is clearly something which is

      a mean between ignorance and wisdom quite true i replied do not

      then insist she said that what is not fair is of necessity foul or

      what is not good evil or infer that because love is not fair and good he

      is therefore foul and evil for he is in a mean between them well i

      said love is surely admitted by all to be a great god by those who

      know or by those who do not know by all and how socrates she said

      with a smile can love be acknowledged to be a great god by those who say

      that he is not a god at all and who are they i said you and i are

      two of them she replied how can that be i said it is quite

      intelligible she replied for you yourself would acknowledge that the

      gods are happy and fairof course you wouldwould you dare to

      say that any god was not certainly not i replied and you mean by

      the happy those who are the possessors of things good or fair yes

      and you admitted that love because he was in want desires those good

      and fair things of which he is in want yes i did but how can he be

      a god who has no portion in what is either good or fair impossible

      then you see that you also deny the divinity of love

    


      what then is love i asked is he mortal no what then as in

      the former instance he is neither mortal nor immortal but in a mean

      between the two what is he diotima he is a great spirit daimon

      and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the

      mortal and what i said is his power he interprets she replied

      between gods and men conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers

      and sacrifices of men and to men the commands and replies of the gods he

      is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them and therefore in

      him all is bound together and through him the arts of the prophet and the

      priest their sacrifices and mysteries and charms and all prophecy and

      incantation find their way for god mingles not with man but through

      love all the intercourse and converse of god with man whether awake or

      asleep is carried on the wisdom which understands this is spiritual all

      other wisdom such as that of arts and handicrafts is mean and vulgar

      now these spirits or intermediate powers are many and diverse and one of

      them is love and who i said was his father and who his mother

      the tale she said will take time nevertheless i will tell you on

      the birthday of aphrodite there was a feast of the gods at which the god

      poros or plenty who is the son of metis or discretion was one of the

      guests when the feast was over penia or poverty as the manner is on

      such occasions came about the doors to beg now plenty who was the worse

      for nectar there was no wine in those days went into the garden of zeus

      and fell into a heavy sleep and poverty considering her own straitened

      circumstances plotted to have a child by him and accordingly she lay

      down at his side and conceived love who partly because he is naturally a

      lover of the beautiful and because aphrodite is herself beautiful and

      also because he was born on her birthday is her follower and attendant

      and as his parentage is so also are his fortunes in the first place he

      is always poor and anything but tender and fair as the many imagine him

      and he is rough and squalid and has no shoes nor a house to dwell in on

      the bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven in the streets or

      at the doors of houses taking his rest and like his mother he is always

      in distress like his father too whom he also partly resembles he is

      always plotting against the fair and good he is bold enterprising

      strong a mighty hunter always weaving some intrigue or other keen in

      the pursuit of wisdom fertile in resources a philosopher at all times

      terrible as an enchanter sorcerer sophist he is by nature neither

      mortal nor immortal but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is in

      plenty and dead at another moment and again alive by reason of his

      fathers nature but that which is always flowing in is always flowing

      out and so he is never in want and never in wealth and further he is

      in a mean between ignorance and knowledge the truth of the matter is

      this no god is a philosopher or seeker after wisdom for he is wise

      already nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom neither do the

      ignorant seek after wisdom for herein is the evil of ignorance that he

      who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself he

      has no desire for that of which he feels no want but who then

      diotima i said are the lovers of wisdom if they are neither the wise

      nor the foolish a child may answer that question she replied they

      are those who are in a mean between the two love is one of them for

      wisdom is a most beautiful thing and love is of the beautiful and

      therefore love is also a philosopher or lover of wisdom and being a lover

      of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant and of this too

      his birth is the cause for his father is wealthy and wise and his mother

      poor and foolish such my dear socrates is the nature of the spirit

      love the error in your conception of him was very natural and as i

      imagine from what you say has arisen out of a confusion of love and the

      beloved which made you think that love was all beautiful for the beloved

      is the truly beautiful and delicate and perfect and blessed but the

      principle of love is of another nature and is such as i have described

    


      i said o thou stranger woman thou sayest well but assuming love to be

      such as you say what is the use of him to men that socrates she

      replied i will attempt to unfold of his nature and birth i have already

      spoken and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful but some one

      will say of the beautiful in what socrates and diotimaor rather

      let me put the question more clearly and ask when a man loves the

      beautiful what does he desire i answered her that the beautiful may be

      his still she said the answer suggests a further question what is

      given by the possession of beauty to what you have asked i replied

      i have no answer ready then she said let me put the word good in

      the place of the beautiful and repeat the question once more if he who

      loves loves the good what is it then that he loves the possession of

      the good i said and what does he gain who possesses the good

      happiness i replied there is less difficulty in answering that

      question yes she said the happy are made happy by the acquisition

      of good things nor is there any need to ask why a man desires happiness

      the answer is already final you are right i said and is this wish

      and this desire common to all and do all men always desire their own

      good or only some menwhat say you all men i replied the

      desire is common to all why then she rejoined are not all men

      socrates said to love but only some of them whereas you say that all

      men are always loving the same things i myself wonder i said why

      this is there is nothing to wonder at she replied the reason is

      that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the whole

      but the other parts have other names give an illustration i said she

      answered me as follows there is poetry which as you know is complex

      and manifold all creation or passage of nonbeing into being is poetry or

      making and the processes of all art are creative and the masters of arts

      are all poets or makers very true still she said you know that

      they are not called poets but have other names only that portion of the

      art which is separated off from the rest and is concerned with music and

      metre is termed poetry and they who possess poetry in this sense of the

      word are called poets very true i said and the same holds of love

      for you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only

      the great and subtle power of love but they who are drawn towards him by

      any other path whether the path of moneymaking or gymnastics or

      philosophy are not called loversthe name of the whole is

      appropriated to those whose affection takes one form onlythey alone

      are said to love or to be lovers i dare say i replied that you are

      right yes she added and you hear people say that lovers are seeking

      for their other half but i say that they are seeking neither for the half

      of themselves nor for the whole unless the half or the whole be also a

      good and they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away

      if they are evil for they love not what is their own unless perchance

      there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good and what belongs

      to another the evil for there is nothing which men love but the good is

      there anything certainly i should say that there is nothing then

      she said the simple truth is that men love the good yes i said

      to which must be added that they love the possession of the good yes

      that must be added and not only the possession but the everlasting

      possession of the good that must be added too then love she said

      may be described generally as the love of the everlasting possession of

      the good that is most true

    


      then if this be the nature of love can you tell me further she said

      what is the manner of the pursuit what are they doing who show all this

      eagerness and heat which is called love and what is the object which they

      have in view answer me nay diotima i replied if i had known i

      should not have wondered at your wisdom neither should i have come to

      learn from you about this very matter well she said i will teach

      youthe object which they have in view is birth in beauty whether

      of body or soul i do not understand you i said the oracle requires

      an explanation i will make my meaning clearer she replied i mean to

      say that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their

      souls there is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of

      procreationprocreation which must be in beauty and not in

      deformity and this procreation is the union of man and woman and is a

      divine thing for conception and generation are an immortal principle in

      the mortal creature and in the inharmonious they can never be but the

      deformed is always inharmonious with the divine and the beautiful

      harmonious beauty then is the destiny or goddess of parturition who

      presides at birth and therefore when approaching beauty the conceiving

      power is propitious and diffusive and benign and begets and bears

      fruit at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense

      of pain and turns away and shrivels up and not without a pang refrains

      from conception and this is the reason why when the hour of conception

      arrives and the teeming nature is full there is such a flutter and

      ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of

      travail for love socrates is not as you imagine the love of the

      beautiful only what then the love of generation and of birth in

      beauty yes i said yes indeed she replied but why of

      generation because to the mortal creature generation is a sort of

      eternity and immortality she replied and if as has been already

      admitted love is of the everlasting possession of the good all men will

      necessarily desire immortality together with good wherefore love is of

      immortality

    


      all this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love and i

      remember her once saying to me what is the cause socrates of love and

      the attendant desire see you not how all animals birds as well as

      beasts in their desire of procreation are in agony when they take the

      infection of love which begins with the desire of union whereto is added

      the care of offspring on whose behalf the weakest are ready to battle

      against the strongest even to the uttermost and to die for them and will

      let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything in order to

      maintain their young man may be supposed to act thus from reason but why

      should animals have these passionate feelings can you tell me why again

      i replied that i did not know she said to me and do you expect ever to

      become a master in the art of love if you do not know this but i have

      told you already diotima that my ignorance is the reason why i come to

      you for i am conscious that i want a teacher tell me then the cause of

      this and of the other mysteries of love marvel not she said if you

      believe that love is of the immortal as we have several times

      acknowledged for here again and on the same principle too the mortal

      nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal

      and this is only to be attained by generation because generation always

      leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old nay even in the

      life of the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity a

      man is called the same and yet in the short interval which elapses

      between youth and age and in which every animal is said to have life and

      identity he is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and reparationhair

      flesh bones blood and the whole body are always changing which is true

      not only of the body but also of the soul whose habits tempers

      opinions desires pleasures pains fears never remain the same in any

      one of us but are always coming and going and equally true of knowledge

      and what is still more surprising to us mortals not only do the sciences

      in general spring up and decay so that in respect of them we are never

      the same but each of them individually experiences a like change for

      what is implied in the word recollection but the departure of

      knowledge which is ever being forgotten and is renewed and preserved by

      recollection and appears to be the same although in reality new

      according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are

      preserved not absolutely the same but by substitution the old wornout

      mortality leaving another new and similar existence behindunlike

      the divine which is always the same and not another and in this way

      socrates the mortal body or mortal anything partakes of immortality

      but the immortal in another way marvel not then at the love which all men

      have of their offspring for that universal love and interest is for the

      sake of immortality

    


      i was astonished at her words and said is this really true o thou wise

      diotima and she answered with all the authority of an accomplished

      sophist of that socrates you may be assuredthink only of the

      ambition of men and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways

      unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of

      fame they are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have run

      for their children and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil and

      even to die for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be

      eternal do you imagine that alcestis would have died to save admetus or

      achilles to avenge patroclus or your own codrus in order to preserve the

      kingdom for his sons if they had not imagined that the memory of their

      virtues which still survives among us would be immortal nay she said

      i am persuaded that all men do all things and the better they are the

      more they do them in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue for

      they desire the immortal

    


      those who are pregnant in the body only betake themselves to women and

      beget childrenthis is the character of their love their offspring

      as they hope will preserve their memory and giving them the blessedness

      and immortality which they desire in the future but souls which are

      pregnantfor there certainly are men who are more creative in their

      souls than in their bodiesconceive that which is proper for the

      soul to conceive or contain and what are these conceptionswisdom

      and virtue in general and such creators are poets and all artists who are

      deserving of the name inventor but the greatest and fairest sort of

      wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and

      families and which is called temperance and justice and he who in youth

      has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired when he

      comes to maturity desires to beget and generate he wanders about seeking

      beauty that he may beget offspringfor in deformity he will beget

      nothingand naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the

      deformed body above all when he finds a fair and noble and wellnurtured

      soul he embraces the two in one person and to such an one he is full of

      speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a good man and he

      tries to educate him and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever

      present to his memory even when absent he brings forth that which he had

      conceived long before and in company with him tends that which he brings

      forth and they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer

      friendship than those who beget mortal children for the children who are

      their common offspring are fairer and more immortal who when he thinks

      of homer and hesiod and other great poets would not rather have their

      children than ordinary human ones who would not emulate them in the

      creation of children such as theirs which have preserved their memory and

      given them everlasting glory or who would not have such children as

      lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours not only of lacedaemon but

      of hellas as one may say there is solon too who is the revered father

      of athenian laws and many others there are in many other places both

      among hellenes and barbarians who have given to the world many noble

      works and have been the parents of virtue of every kind and many temples

      have been raised in their honour for the sake of children such as theirs

      which were never raised in honour of any one for the sake of his mortal

      children

    


      these are the lesser mysteries of love into which even you socrates

      may enter to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of

      these and to which if you pursue them in a right spirit they will lead

      i know not whether you will be able to attain but i will do my utmost to

      inform you and do you follow if you can for he who would proceed aright

      in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms and first

      if he be guided by his instructor aright to love one such form onlyout

      of that he should create fair thoughts and soon he will of himself

      perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another and

      then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit how foolish would he be

      not to recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same and when

      he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one which he will

      despise and deem a small thing and will become a lover of all beautiful

      forms in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is

      more honourable than the beauty of the outward form so that if a virtuous

      soul have but a little comeliness he will be content to love and tend

      him and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve

      the young until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of

      institutions and laws and to understand that the beauty of them all is of

      one family and that personal beauty is a trifle and after laws and

      institutions he will go on to the sciences that he may see their beauty

      being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or

      institution himself a slave mean and narrowminded but drawing towards

      and contemplating the vast sea of beauty he will create many fair and

      noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom until on that

      shore he grows and waxes strong and at last the vision is revealed to him

      of a single science which is the science of beauty everywhere to this i

      will proceed please to give me your very best attention

    


      he who has been instructed thus far in the things of love and who has

      learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession when he comes

      toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty and

      this socrates is the final cause of all our former toilsa nature

      which in the first place is everlasting not growing and decaying or

      waxing and waning secondly not fair in one point of view and foul in

      another or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair at

      another time or in another relation or at another place foul as if fair

      to some and foul to others or in the likeness of a face or hands or any

      other part of the bodily frame or in any form of speech or knowledge or

      existing in any other being as for example in an animal or in heaven

      or in earth or in any other place but beauty absolute separate simple

      and everlasting which without diminution and without increase or any

      change is imparted to the evergrowing and perishing beauties of all

      other things he who from these ascending under the influence of true

      love begins to perceive that beauty is not far from the end and the

      true order of going or being led by another to the things of love is to

      begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that

      other beauty using these as steps only and from one going on to two and

      from two to all fair forms and from fair forms to fair practices and

      from fair practices to fair notions until from fair notions he arrives at

      the notion of absolute beauty and at last knows what the essence of

      beauty is this my dear socrates said the stranger of mantineia is

      that life above all others which man should live in the contemplation of

      beauty absolute a beauty which if you once beheld you would see not to

      be after the measure of gold and garments and fair boys and youths

      whose presence now entrances you and you and many a one would be content

      to live seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink

      if that were possibleyou only want to look at them and to be with

      them but what if man had eyes to see the true beautythe divine

      beauty i mean pure and clear and unalloyed not clogged with the

      pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human lifethither

      looking and holding converse with the true beauty simple and divine

      remember how in that communion only beholding beauty with the eye of the

      mind he will be enabled to bring forth not images of beauty but

      realities for he has hold not of an image but of a reality and bringing

      forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of god and be

      immortal if mortal man may would that be an ignoble life

    


      such phaedrusand i speak not only to you but to all of youwere

      the words of diotima and i am persuaded of their truth and being

      persuaded of them i try to persuade others that in the attainment of

      this end human nature will not easily find a helper better than love and

      therefore also i say that every man ought to honour him as i myself

      honour him and walk in his ways and exhort others to do the same and

      praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of my ability

      now and ever

    


      the words which i have spoken you phaedrus may call an encomium of

      love or anything else which you please

    


      when socrates had done speaking the company applauded and aristophanes

      was beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which socrates

      had made to his own speech when suddenly there was a great knocking at

      the door of the house as of revellers and the sound of a flutegirl was

      heard agathon told the attendants to go and see who were the intruders

      if they are friends of ours he said invite them in but if not say

      that the drinking is over a little while afterwards they heard the voice

      of alcibiades resounding in the court he was in a great state of

      intoxication and kept roaring and shouting where is agathon lead me to

      agathon and at length supported by the flutegirl and some of his

      attendants he found his way to them hail friends he said appearing

      at the door crowned with a massive garland of ivy and violets his head

      flowing with ribands will you have a very drunken man as a companion of

      your revels or shall i crown agathon which was my intention in coming

      and go away for i was unable to come yesterday and therefore i am here

      today carrying on my head these ribands that taking them from my own

      head i may crown the head of this fairest and wisest of men as i may be

      allowed to call him will you laugh at me because i am drunk yet i know

      very well that i am speaking the truth although you may laugh but first

      tell me if i come in shall we have the understanding of which i spoke

      supra will you have a very drunken man etc will you drink with me or

      not

    


      the company were vociferous in begging that he would take his place among

      them and agathon specially invited him thereupon he was led in by the

      people who were with him and as he was being led intending to crown

      agathon he took the ribands from his own head and held them in front of

      his eyes he was thus prevented from seeing socrates who made way for

      him and alcibiades took the vacant place between agathon and socrates

      and in taking the place he embraced agathon and crowned him take off his

      sandals said agathon and let him make a third on the same couch

    


      by all means but who makes the third partner in our revels said

      alcibiades turning round and starting up as he caught sight of socrates

      by heracles he said what is this here is socrates always lying in wait

      for me and always as his way is coming out at all sorts of unsuspected

      places and now what have you to say for yourself and why are you lying

      here where i perceive that you have contrived to find a place not by a

      joker or lover of jokes like aristophanes but by the fairest of the

      company

    


      socrates turned to agathon and said i must ask you to protect me

      agathon for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious matter to

      me since i became his admirer i have never been allowed to speak to any

      other fair one or so much as to look at them if i do he goes wild with

      envy and jealousy and not only abuses me but can hardly keep his hands

      off me and at this moment he may do me some harm please to see to this

      and either reconcile me to him or if he attempts violence protect me

      as i am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts

    


      there can never be reconciliation between you and me said alcibiades but

      for the present i will defer your chastisement and i must beg you

      agathon to give me back some of the ribands that i may crown the

      marvellous head of this universal despoti would not have him

      complain of me for crowning you and neglecting him who in conversation

      is the conqueror of all mankind and this not only once as you were the

      day before yesterday but always whereupon taking some of the ribands

      he crowned socrates and again reclined

    


      then he said you seem my friends to be sober which is a thing not to

      be endured you must drinkfor that was the agreement under which i

      was admittedand i elect myself master of the feast until you are

      well drunk let us have a large goblet agathon or rather he said

      addressing the attendant bring me that winecooler the winecooler which

      had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than two quartsthis he

      filled and emptied and bade the attendant fill it again for socrates

      observe my friends said alcibiades that this ingenious trick of mine

      will have no effect on socrates for he can drink any quantity of wine and

      not be at all nearer being drunk socrates drank the cup which the

      attendant filled for him

    


      eryximachus said what is this alcibiades are we to have neither

      conversation nor singing over our cups but simply to drink as if we were

      thirsty

    


      alcibiades replied hail worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire

    


      the same to you said eryximachus but what shall we do

    


      that i leave to you said alcibiades

    


      the wise physician skilled our wounds to heal from popes homer il

    


      shall prescribe and we will obey what do you want

    


      well said eryximachus before you appeared we had passed a resolution

      that each one of us in turn should make a speech in praise of love and as

      good a one as he could the turn was passed round from left to right and

      as all of us have spoken and you have not spoken but have well drunken

      you ought to speak and then impose upon socrates any task which you

      please and he on his right hand neighbour and so on

    


      that is good eryximachus said alcibiades and yet the comparison of a

      drunken mans speech with those of sober men is hardly fair and i should

      like to know sweet friend whether you really believe what socrates was

      just now saying for i can assure you that the very reverse is the fact

      and that if i praise any one but himself in his presence whether god or

      man he will hardly keep his hands off me

    


      for shame said socrates

    


      hold your tongue said alcibiades for by poseidon there is no one else

      whom i will praise when you are of the company

    


      well then said eryximachus if you like praise socrates

    


      what do you think eryximachus said alcibiades shall i attack him and

      inflict the punishment before you all

    


      what are you about said socrates are you going to raise a laugh at my

      expense is that the meaning of your praise

    


      i am going to speak the truth if you will permit me

    


      i not only permit but exhort you to speak the truth

    


      then i will begin at once said alcibiades and if i say anything which is

      not true you may interrupt me if you will and say that is a lie

      though my intention is to speak the truth but you must not wonder if i

      speak any how as things come into my mind for the fluent and orderly

      enumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to a man

      in my condition

    


      and now my boys i shall praise socrates in a figure which will appear to

      him to be a caricature and yet i speak not to make fun of him but only

      for the truths sake i say that he is exactly like the busts of silenus

      which are set up in the statuaries shops holding pipes and flutes in

      their mouths and they are made to open in the middle and have images of

      gods inside them i say also that he is like marsyas the satyr you

      yourself will not deny socrates that your face is like that of a satyr

      aye and there is a resemblance in other points too for example you are

      a bully as i can prove by witnesses if you will not confess and are you

      not a fluteplayer that you are and a performer far more wonderful than

      marsyas he indeed with instruments used to charm the souls of men by the

      power of his breath and the players of his music do so still for the

      melodies of olympus compare arist pol are derived from marsyas who

      taught them and these whether they are played by a great master or by a

      miserable flutegirl have a power which no others have they alone

      possess the soul and reveal the wants of those who have need of gods and

      mysteries because they are divine but you produce the same effect with

      your words only and do not require the flute that is the difference

      between you and him when we hear any other speaker even a very good one

      he produces absolutely no effect upon us or not much whereas the mere

      fragments of you and your words even at secondhand and however

      imperfectly repeated amaze and possess the souls of every man woman and

      child who comes within hearing of them and if i were not afraid that you

      would think me hopelessly drunk i would have sworn as well as spoken to

      the influence which they have always had and still have over me for my

      heart leaps within me more than that of any corybantian reveller and my

      eyes rain tears when i hear them and i observe that many others are

      affected in the same manner i have heard pericles and other great

      orators and i thought that they spoke well but i never had any similar

      feeling my soul was not stirred by them nor was i angry at the thought

      of my own slavish state but this marsyas has often brought me to such a

      pass that i have felt as if i could hardly endure the life which i am

      leading this socrates you will admit and i am conscious that if i did

      not shut my ears against him and fly as from the voice of the siren my

      fate would be like that of othershe would transfix me and i

      should grow old sitting at his feet for he makes me confess that i ought

      not to live as i do neglecting the wants of my own soul and busying

      myself with the concerns of the athenians therefore i hold my ears and

      tear myself away from him and he is the only person who ever made me

      ashamed which you might think not to be in my nature and there is no one

      else who does the same for i know that i cannot answer him or say that i

      ought not to do as he bids but when i leave his presence the love of

      popularity gets the better of me and therefore i run away and fly from

      him and when i see him i am ashamed of what i have confessed to him many

      a time have i wished that he were dead and yet i know that i should be

      much more sorry than glad if he were to die so that i am at my wits

      end

    


      and this is what i and many others have suffered from the fluteplaying of

      this satyr yet hear me once more while i show you how exact the image is

      and how marvellous his power for let me tell you none of you know him

      but i will reveal him to you having begun i must go on see you how fond

      he is of the fair he is always with them and is always being smitten by

      them and then again he knows nothing and is ignorant of all thingssuch

      is the appearance which he puts on is he not like a silenus in this to

      be sure he is his outer mask is the carved head of the silenus but o my

      companions in drink when he is opened what temperance there is residing

      within know you that beauty and wealth and honour at which the many

      wonder are of no account with him and are utterly despised by him he

      regards not at all the persons who are gifted with them mankind are

      nothing to him all his life is spent in mocking and flouting at them but

      when i opened him and looked within at his serious purpose i saw in him

      divine and golden images of such fascinating beauty that i was ready to do

      in a moment whatever socrates commanded they may have escaped the

      observation of others but i saw them now i fancied that he was seriously

      enamoured of my beauty and i thought that i should therefore have a grand

      opportunity of hearing him tell what he knew for i had a wonderful

      opinion of the attractions of my youth in the prosecution of this design

      when i next went to him i sent away the attendant who usually accompanied

      me i will confess the whole truth and beg you to listen and if i speak

      falsely do you socrates expose the falsehood well he and i were

      alone together and i thought that when there was nobody with us i should

      hear him speak the language which lovers use to their loves when they are

      by themselves and i was delighted nothing of the sort he conversed as

      usual and spent the day with me and then went away afterwards i

      challenged him to the palaestra and he wrestled and closed with me

      several times when there was no one present i fancied that i might

      succeed in this manner not a bit i made no way with him lastly as i

      had failed hitherto i thought that i must take stronger measures and

      attack him boldly and as i had begun not give him up but see how

      matters stood between him and me so i invited him to sup with me just as

      if he were a fair youth and i a designing lover he was not easily

      persuaded to come he did however after a while accept the invitation

      and when he came the first time he wanted to go away at once as soon as

      supper was over and i had not the face to detain him the second time

      still in pursuance of my design after we had supped i went on conversing

      far into the night and when he wanted to go away i pretended that the

      hour was late and that he had much better remain so he lay down on the

      couch next to me the same on which he had supped and there was no one

      but ourselves sleeping in the apartment all this may be told without

      shame to any one but what follows i could hardly tell you if i were

      sober yet as the proverb says in vino veritas whether with boys or

      without them in allusion to two proverbs and therefore i must speak

      nor again should i be justified in concealing the lofty actions of

      socrates when i come to praise him moreover i have felt the serpents

      sting and he who has suffered as they say is willing to tell his

      fellowsufferers only as they alone will be likely to understand him and

      will not be extreme in judging of the sayings or doings which have been

      wrung from his agony for i have been bitten by a more than vipers tooth

      i have known in my soul or in my heart or in some other part that worst

      of pangs more violent in ingenuous youth than any serpents tooth the

      pang of philosophy which will make a man say or do anything and you whom

      i see around me phaedrus and agathon and eryximachus and pausanias and

      aristodemus and aristophanes all of you and i need not say socrates

      himself have had experience of the same madness and passion in your

      longing after wisdom therefore listen and excuse my doings then and my

      sayings now but let the attendants and other profane and unmannered

      persons close up the doors of their ears

    


      when the lamp was put out and the servants had gone away i thought that i

      must be plain with him and have no more ambiguity so i gave him a shake

      and i said socrates are you asleep no he said do you know what i

      am meditating what are you meditating he said i think i replied

      that of all the lovers whom i have ever had you are the only one who is

      worthy of me and you appear to be too modest to speak now i feel that i

      should be a fool to refuse you this or any other favour and therefore i

      come to lay at your feet all that i have and all that my friends have in

      the hope that you will assist me in the way of virtue which i desire

      above all things and in which i believe that you can help me better than

      any one else and i should certainly have more reason to be ashamed of

      what wise men would say if i were to refuse a favour to such as you than

      of what the world who are mostly fools would say of me if i granted it

      to these words he replied in the ironical manner which is so

      characteristic of himalcibiades my friend you have indeed an

      elevated aim if what you say is true and if there really is in me any

      power by which you may become better truly you must see in me some rare

      beauty of a kind infinitely higher than any which i see in you and

      therefore if you mean to share with me and to exchange beauty for beauty

      you will have greatly the advantage of me you will gain true beauty in

      return for appearancelike diomede gold in exchange for brass but

      look again sweet friend and see whether you are not deceived in me the

      mind begins to grow critical when the bodily eye fails and it will be a

      long time before you get old hearing this i said i have told you my

      purpose which is quite serious and do you consider what you think best

      for you and me that is good he said at some other time then we will

      consider and act as seems best about this and about other matters

      whereupon i fancied that he was smitten and that the words which i had

      uttered like arrows had wounded him and so without waiting to hear more i

      got up and throwing my coat about him crept under his threadbare cloak

      as the time of year was winter and there i lay during the whole night

      having this wonderful monster in my arms this again socrates will not

      be denied by you and yet notwithstanding all he was so superior to my

      solicitations so contemptuous and derisive and disdainful of my beautywhich

      really as i fancied had some attractionshear o judges for

      judges you shall be of the haughty virtue of socratesnothing more

      happened but in the morning when i awoke let all the gods and goddesses

      be my witnesses i arose as from the couch of a father or an elder

      brother

    


      what do you suppose must have been my feelings after this rejection at

      the thought of my own dishonour and yet i could not help wondering at his

      natural temperance and selfrestraint and manliness i never imagined that

      i could have met with a man such as he is in wisdom and endurance and

      therefore i could not be angry with him or renounce his company any more

      than i could hope to win him for i well knew that if ajax could not be

      wounded by steel much less he by money and my only chance of captivating

      him by my personal attractions had failed so i was at my wits end no

      one was ever more hopelessly enslaved by another all this happened before

      he and i went on the expedition to potidaea there we messed together and

      i had the opportunity of observing his extraordinary power of sustaining

      fatigue his endurance was simply marvellous when being cut off from our

      supplies we were compelled to go without foodon such occasions

      which often happen in time of war he was superior not only to me but to

      everybody there was no one to be compared to him yet at a festival he

      was the only person who had any real powers of enjoyment though not

      willing to drink he could if compelled beat us all at thatwonderful

      to relate no human being had ever seen socrates drunk and his powers if

      i am not mistaken will be tested before long his fortitude in enduring

      cold was also surprising there was a severe frost for the winter in that

      region is really tremendous and everybody else either remained indoors

      or if they went out had on an amazing quantity of clothes and were well

      shod and had their feet swathed in felt and fleeces in the midst of

      this socrates with his bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress

      marched better than the other soldiers who had shoes and they looked

      daggers at him because he seemed to despise them

    


      i have told you one tale and now i must tell you another which is worth

      hearing

    


      of the doings and sufferings of the enduring man

    


      while he was on the expedition one morning he was thinking about

      something which he could not resolve he would not give it up but

      continued thinking from early dawn until noonthere he stood fixed

      in thought and at noon attention was drawn to him and the rumour ran

      through the wondering crowd that socrates had been standing and thinking

      about something ever since the break of day at last in the evening after

      supper some ionians out of curiosity i should explain that this was not

      in winter but in summer brought out their mats and slept in the open air

      that they might watch him and see whether he would stand all night there

      he stood until the following morning and with the return of light he

      offered up a prayer to the sun and went his way compare supra i will

      also tell if you pleaseand indeed i am bound to tellof his

      courage in battle for who but he saved my life now this was the

      engagement in which i received the prize of valour for i was wounded and

      he would not leave me but he rescued me and my arms and he ought to have

      received the prize of valour which the generals wanted to confer on me

      partly on account of my rank and i told them so this again socrates

      will not impeach or deny but he was more eager than the generals that i

      and not he should have the prize there was another occasion on which his

      behaviour was very remarkablein the flight of the army after the

      battle of delium where he served among the heavyarmedi had a

      better opportunity of seeing him than at potidaea for i was myself on

      horseback and therefore comparatively out of danger he and laches were

      retreating for the troops were in flight and i met them and told them

      not to be discouraged and promised to remain with them and there you

      might see him aristophanes as you describe aristoph clouds just as

      he is in the streets of athens stalking like a pelican and rolling his

      eyes calmly contemplating enemies as well as friends and making very

      intelligible to anybody even from a distance that whoever attacked him

      would be likely to meet with a stout resistance and in this way he and

      his companion escapedfor this is the sort of man who is never

      touched in war those only are pursued who are running away headlong i

      particularly observed how superior he was to laches in presence of mind

      many are the marvels which i might narrate in praise of socrates most of

      his ways might perhaps be paralleled in another man but his absolute

      unlikeness to any human being that is or ever has been is perfectly

      astonishing you may imagine brasidas and others to have been like

      achilles or you may imagine nestor and antenor to have been like

      pericles and the same may be said of other famous men but of this

      strange being you will never be able to find any likeness however remote

      either among men who now are or who ever have beenother than that

      which i have already suggested of silenus and the satyrs and they

      represent in a figure not only himself but his words for although i

      forgot to mention this to you before his words are like the images of

      silenus which open they are ridiculous when you first hear them he

      clothes himself in language that is like the skin of the wanton satyrfor

      his talk is of packasses and smiths and cobblers and curriers and he is

      always repeating the same things in the same words compare gorg so

      that any ignorant or inexperienced person might feel disposed to laugh at

      him but he who opens the bust and sees what is within will find that they

      are the only words which have a meaning in them and also the most divine

      abounding in fair images of virtue and of the widest comprehension or

      rather extending to the whole duty of a good and honourable man

    


      this friends is my praise of socrates i have added my blame of him for

      his illtreatment of me and he has illtreated not only me but charmides

      the son of glaucon and euthydemus the son of diocles and many others in

      the same waybeginning as their lover he has ended by making them

      pay their addresses to him wherefore i say to you agathon be not

      deceived by him learn from me and take warning and do not be a fool and

      learn by experience as the proverb says

    


      when alcibiades had finished there was a laugh at his outspokenness for

      he seemed to be still in love with socrates you are sober alcibiades

      said socrates or you would never have gone so far about to hide the

      purpose of your satyrs praises for all this long story is only an

      ingenious circumlocution of which the point comes in by the way at the

      end you want to get up a quarrel between me and agathon and your notion

      is that i ought to love you and nobody else and that you and you only

      ought to love agathon but the plot of this satyric or silenic drama has

      been detected and you must not allow him agathon to set us at variance

    


      i believe you are right said agathon and i am disposed to think that his

      intention in placing himself between you and me was only to divide us but

      he shall gain nothing by that move for i will go and lie on the couch

      next to you

    


      yes yes replied socrates by all means come here and lie on the couch

      below me

    


      alas said alcibiades how i am fooled by this man he is determined to

      get the better of me at every turn i do beseech you allow agathon to lie

      between us

    


      certainly not said socrates as you praised me and i in turn ought to

      praise my neighbour on the right he will be out of order in praising me

      again when he ought rather to be praised by me and i must entreat you to

      consent to this and not be jealous for i have a great desire to praise

      the youth

    


      hurrah cried agathon i will rise instantly that i may be praised by

      socrates

    


      the usual way said alcibiades where socrates is no one else has any

      chance with the fair and now how readily has he invented a specious

      reason for attracting agathon to himself

    


      agathon arose in order that he might take his place on the couch by

      socrates when suddenly a band of revellers entered and spoiled the order

      of the banquet some one who was going out having left the door open they

      had found their way in and made themselves at home great confusion

      ensued and every one was compelled to drink large quantities of wine

      aristodemus said that eryximachus phaedrus and others went awayhe

      himself fell asleep and as the nights were long took a good rest he was

      awakened towards daybreak by a crowing of cocks and when he awoke the

      others were either asleep or had gone away there remained only socrates

      aristophanes and agathon who were drinking out of a large goblet which

      they passed round and socrates was discoursing to them aristodemus was

      only half awake and he did not hear the beginning of the discourse the

      chief thing which he remembered was socrates compelling the other two to

      acknowledge that the genius of comedy was the same with that of tragedy

      and that the true artist in tragedy was an artist in comedy also to this

      they were constrained to assent being drowsy and not quite following the

      argument and first of all aristophanes dropped off then when the day

      was already dawning agathon socrates having laid them to sleep rose to

      depart aristodemus as his manner was following him at the lyceum he

      took a bath and passed the day as usual in the evening he retired to

      rest at his own home

introduction


in what relation the apology of plato stands to the real defence

of socrates there are no means of determining it certainly agrees in tone and

character with the description of xenophon who says in the

memorabilia that socrates might have been acquitted if in

any moderate degree he would have conciliated the favour of the dicasts

and who informs us in another passage on the testimony of hermogenes the

friend of socrates that he had no wish to live and that the divine sign

refused to allow him to prepare a defence and also that socrates himself

declared this to be unnecessary on the ground that all his life long he had

been preparing against that hour for the speech breathes throughout a spirit

of defiance ut non supplex aut reus sed magister aut dominus

videretur esse judicum cic de orat i  and the

loose and desultory style is an imitation of the accustomed

manner in which socrates spoke in the agora and among the

tables of the moneychangers the allusion in the crito

 b may perhaps be adduced as a further evidence of the literal accuracy

of some parts  c d but in the main it must be regarded as the ideal of

socrates according to platos conception of him appearing in the

greatest and most public scene of his life and in the height of his triumph

when he is weakest and yet his mastery over mankind is greatest and his

habitual irony acquires a new meaning and a sort of tragic pathos in the face

of death the facts of his life are summed up and the features of his

character are brought out as if by accident in the course of the defence the

conversational manner the seeming want of arrangement the ironical

simplicity are found to result in a perfect work of art which is the portrait

of socrates




yet some of the topics may have been actually used by socrates and the

recollection of his very words may have rung in the ears of his disciple the

apology of plato may be compared generally with those speeches of

thucydides in which he has embodied his conception of the lofty character and

policy of the great pericles and which at the same time furnish a commentary

on the situation of affairs from the point of view of the historian so in the

apology there is an ideal rather than a literal truth much is

said which was not said and is only platos view of the situation plato

was not like xenophon a chronicler of facts he does not appear in any of his

writings to have aimed at literal accuracy he is not therefore to be

supplemented from the memorabilia and symposium of xenophon who belongs to an

entirely different class of writers the apology of plato is not the report of

what socrates said but an elaborate composition quite as much so in fact as

one of the dialogues and we may perhaps even indulge in the fancy that the

actual defence of socrates was as much greater than the platonic defence as the

master was greater than the disciple but in any case some of the words used

by him must have been remembered and some of the facts recorded must have

actually occurred it is significant that plato is said to have been present at

the defence apol as he is also said to have been absent at the last scene

in the phdo is it fanciful to suppose that he meant to give the

stamp of authenticity to the one and not to the otherespecially when we

consider that these two passages are the only ones in which plato makes mention

of himself the circumstance that plato was to be one of his sureties for the

payment of the fine which he proposed has the appearance of truth more

suspicious is the statement that socrates received the first impulse to his

favourite calling of crossexamining the world from the oracle of delphi for

he must already have been famous before chaerephon went to consult the oracle

riddell and the story is of a kind which is very likely to have been

invented on the whole we arrive at the conclusion that the

apology is true to the character of socrates but we cannot show

that any single sentence in it was actually spoken by him it breathes the

spirit of socrates but has been cast anew in the mould of plato




there is not much in the other dialogues which can be compared with the

apology the same recollection of his master may have been

present to the mind of plato when depicting the sufferings of the just in the

republic the crito may also be regarded as a sort

of appendage to the apology in which socrates who has defied

the judges is nevertheless represented as scrupulously obedient to the laws

the idealization of the sufferer is carried still further in the

georgias in which the thesis is maintained that to

suffer is better than to do evil and the art of rhetoric is described

as only useful for the purpose of selfaccusation the parallelisms which occur

in the socalled apology of xenophon are not worth noticing

because the writing in which they are contained is manifestly spurious the

statements of the memorabilia respecting the trial and death of

socrates agree generally with plato but they have lost the flavour of socratic

irony in the narrative of xenophon




the apology or platonic defence of socrates is divided into three

parts st the defence properly so called nd the shorter address in

mitigation of the penalty rd the last words of prophetic rebuke and

exhortation




the first part commences with an apology for his colloquial style he is as he

has always been the enemy of rhetoric and knows of no rhetoric but truth he

will not falsify his character by making a speech then he proceeds to divide

his accusers into two classes first there is the nameless

accuserpublic opinion all the world from their earliest years had heard

that he was a corrupter of youth and had seen him caricatured in the

clouds of aristophanes secondly there are the professed

accusers who are but the mouthpiece of the others the accusations of both

might be summed up in a formula the first say socrates is an evildoer

and a curious person searching into things under the earth and above the

heaven and making the worse appear the better cause and teaching all this to

others the second socrates is an evildoer and corrupter of the

youth who does not receive the gods whom the state receives but introduces

other new divinities these last words appear to have been the actual

indictment compare xen mem and the previous formula which is a summary of

public opinion assumes the same legal style




the answer begins by clearing up a confusion in the representations of the

comic poets and in the opinion of the multitude he had been identified with

the teachers of physical science and with the sophists but this was an error

for both of them he professes a respect in the open court which contrasts with

his manner of speaking about them in other places compare for anaxagoras

phdo laws for the sophists meno republic tim theaet soph etc but

at the same time he shows that he is not one of them of natural philosophy he

knows nothing not that he despises such pursuits but the fact is that he is

ignorant of them and never says a word about them nor is he paid for giving

instructionthat is another mistaken notionhe has nothing to

teach but he commends evenus for teaching virtue at such a

moderate rate as five min something of the accustomed

irony which may perhaps be expected to sleep in the ear of the

multitude is lurking here




he then goes on to explain the reason why he is in such an evil name that had

arisen out of a peculiar mission which he had taken upon himself the

enthusiastic chaerephon probably in anticipation of the answer which he

received had gone to delphi and asked the oracle if there was any man wiser

than socrates and the answer was that there was no man wiser what could be

the meaning of thisthat he who knew nothing and knew that he knew

nothing should be declared by the oracle to be the wisest of men reflecting

upon the answer he determined to refute it by finding a wiser

and first he went to the politicians and then to the poets and then to the

craftsmen but always with the same resulthe found that they knew

nothing or hardly anything more than himself and that the little advantage

which in some cases they possessed was more than counterbalanced by their

conceit of knowledge he knew nothing and knew that he knew nothing they knew

little or nothing and imagined that they knew all things thus he had passed

his life as a sort of missionary in detecting the pretended wisdom of mankind

and this occupation had quite absorbed him and taken him away both from public

and private affairs young men of the richer sort had made a pastime of the

same pursuit which was not unamusing and hence bitter enmities

had arisen the professors of knowledge had revenged themselves by calling him

a villainous corrupter of youth and by repeating the commonplaces about

atheism and materialism and sophistry which are the stockaccusations against

all philosophers when there is nothing else to be said of them




the second accusation he meets by interrogating meletus who is present and can

be interrogated if he is the corrupter who is the improver of the

citizens compare meno all men everywhere but how

absurd how contrary to analogy is this how inconceivable too that he should

make the citizens worse when he has to live with them this surely cannot be

intentional and if unintentional he ought to have been instructed by meletus

and not accused in the court




but there is another part of the indictment which says that he teaches men not

to receive the gods whom the city receives and has other new gods is

that the way in which he is supposed to corrupt the youth yes

it is has he only new gods or none at all none

at all what not even the sun and moon no why

he says that the sun is a stone and the moon earth that replies

socrates is the old confusion about anaxagoras the athenian people are not so

ignorant as to attribute to the influence of socrates notions which have found

their way into the drama and may be learned at the theatre socrates

undertakes to show that meletus rather unjustifiably has been compounding a

riddle in this part of the indictment there are no gods but socrates

believes in the existence of the sons of gods which is absurd




leaving meletus who has had enough words spent upon him he returns to the

original accusation the question may be asked why will he persist in

following a profession which leads him to death whybecause he must

remain at his post where the god has placed him as he remained at potidaea

and amphipolis and delium where the generals placed him besides he is not

so overwise as to imagine that he knows whether death is a good or an evil and

he is certain that desertion of his duty is an evil anytus is quite right in

saying that they should never have indicted him if they meant to let him go

for he will certainly obey god rather than man and will continue to preach to

all men of all ages the necessity of virtue and improvement and if they refuse

to listen to him he will still persevere and reprove them this is his way of

corrupting the youth which he will not cease to follow in obedience to the

god even if a thousand deaths await him




he is desirous that they should let him livenot for his own sake but

for theirs because he is their heavensent friend and they will never have

such another or as he may be ludicrously described he is the gadfly who

stirs the generous steed into motion why then has he never taken part in

public affairs because the familiar divine voice has hindered him if he had

been a public man and had fought for the right as he would certainly have

fought against the many he would not have lived and could therefore have done

no good twice in public matters he has risked his life for the sake of

justiceonce at the trial of the generals and again in resistance to the

tyrannical commands of the thirty




but though not a public man he has passed his days in instructing the

citizens without fee or rewardthis was his mission whether his

disciples have turned out well or ill he cannot justly be charged with the

result for he never promised to teach them anything they might come if they

liked and they might stay away if they liked and they did come because they

found an amusement in hearing the pretenders to wisdom detected if they have

been corrupted their elder relatives if not themselves might surely come

into court and witness against him and there is an opportunity still for them

to appear but their fathers and brothers all appear in court including

this plato to witness on his behalf and if their relatives are

corrupted at least they are uncorrupted and they are my witnesses for

they know that i am speaking the truth and that meletus is lying




this is about all that he has to say he will not entreat the judges to spare

his life neither will he present a spectacle of weeping children although he

too is not made of rock or oak some of the judges themselves

may have complied with this practice on similar occasions and he trusts that

they will not be angry with him for not following their example but he feels

that such conduct brings discredit on the name of athens he feels too that

the judge has sworn not to give away justice and he cannot be guilty of the

impiety of asking the judge to break his oath when he is himself being tried

for impiety




as he expected and probably intended he is convicted and now the tone of the

speech instead of being more conciliatory becomes more lofty and commanding

anytus proposes death as the penalty and what counterproposition shall he

make he the benefactor of the athenian people whose whole life has been

spent in doing them good should at least have the olympic victors

reward of maintenance in the prytaneum or why should he propose any

counterpenalty when he does not know whether death which anytus proposes is

a good or an evil and he is certain that imprisonment is an evil exile is an

evil loss of money might be an evil but then he has none to give perhaps he

can make up a mina let that be the penalty or if his friends wish thirty

min for which they will be excellent securities




he is condemned to death




he is an old man already and the athenians will gain nothing but disgrace by

depriving him of a few years of life perhaps he could have escaped if he had

chosen to throw down his arms and entreat for his life but he does not at all

repent of the manner of his defence he would rather die in his own fashion

than live in theirs for the penalty of unrighteousness is swifter than death

that penalty has already overtaken his accusers as death will soon overtake

him




and now as one who is about to die he will prophesy to them they have put

him to death in order to escape the necessity of giving an account of their

lives but his death will be the seed of many disciples who will

convince them of their evil ways and will come forth to reprove them in

harsher terms because they are younger and more inconsiderate




he would like to say a few words while there is time to those who would have

acquitted him he wishes them to know that the divine sign never interrupted

him in the course of his defence the reason of which as he conjectures is

that the death to which he is going is a good and not an evil for either death

is a long sleep the best of sleeps or a journey to another world in which the

souls of the dead are gathered together and in which there may be a hope of

seeing the heroes of oldin which too there are just judges and as all

are immortal there can be no fear of any one suffering death for his opinions




nothing evil can happen to the good man either in life or death and his own

death has been permitted by the gods because it was better for him to depart

and therefore he forgives his judges because they have done him no harm

although they never meant to do him any good




he has a last request to make to themthat they will trouble his sons as

he has troubled them if they appear to prefer riches to virtue or to think

themselves something when they are nothing





few persons will be found to wish that socrates should have defended

himself otherwiseif as we must add his defence was that with

which plato has provided him but leaving this question which does not admit

of a precise solution we may go on to ask what was the impression which plato

in the apology intended to give of the character and conduct of

his master in the last great scene did he intend to represent him  as

employing sophistries  as designedly irritating the judges or are these

sophistries to be regarded as belonging to the age in which he lived and to his

personal character and this apparent haughtiness as flowing from the natural

elevation of his position




for example when he says that it is absurd to suppose that one man is the

corrupter and all the rest of the world the improvers of the youth or when he

argues that he never could have corrupted the men with whom he had to live or

when he proves his belief in the gods because he believes in the sons of gods

is he serious or jesting it may be observed that these sophisms all occur in

his crossexamination of meletus who is easily foiled and mastered in the

hands of the great dialectician perhaps he regarded these answers as good

enough for his accuser of whom he makes very light also there is a touch of

irony in them which takes them out of the category of sophistry compare

euthyph




that the manner in which he defends himself about the lives of his disciples is

not satisfactory can hardly be denied fresh in the memory of the athenians

and detestable as they deserved to be to the newly restored democracy were the

names of alcibiades critias charmides it is obviously not a sufficient

answer that socrates had never professed to teach them anything and is

therefore not justly chargeable with their crimes yet the defence when taken

out of this ironical form is doubtless sound that his teaching had nothing to

do with their evil lives here then the sophistry is rather in form than in

substance though we might desire that to such a serious charge socrates had

given a more serious answer




truly characteristic of socrates is another point in his answer which may also

be regarded as sophistical he says that if he has corrupted the youth

he must have corrupted them involuntarily but if as socrates argues

all evil is involuntary then all criminals ought to be admonished and not

punished in these words the socratic doctrine of the involuntariness of evil

is clearly intended to be conveyed here again as in the former instance the

defence of socrates is untrue practically but may be true in some ideal or

transcendental sense the commonplace reply that if he had been guilty of

corrupting the youth their relations would surely have witnessed against him

with which he concludes this part of his defence is more satisfactory




again when socrates argues that he must believe in the gods because he

believes in the sons of gods we must remember that this is a refutation not of

the original indictment which is consistent enoughsocrates does

not receive the gods whom the city receives and has other new

divinitiesbut of the interpretation put upon the words by

meletus who has affirmed that he is a downright atheist to this socrates

fairly answers in accordance with the ideas of the time that a downright

atheist cannot believe in the sons of gods or in divine things the notion that

demons or lesser divinities are the sons of gods is not to be regarded as

ironical or sceptical he is arguing ad hominem according to the

notions of mythology current in his age yet he abstains from saying that he

believed in the gods whom the state approved he does not defend himself as

xenophon has defended him by appealing to his practice of religion probably

he neither wholly believed nor disbelieved in the existence of the popular

gods he had no means of knowing about them according to plato compare phdo

symp as well as xenophon memor he was punctual in the performance of the

least religious duties and he must have believed in his own oracular sign of

which he seemed to have an internal witness but the existence of apollo or

zeus or the other gods whom the state approves would have appeared to him

both uncertain and unimportant in comparison of the duty of selfexamination

and of those principles of truth and right which he deemed to be the foundation

of religion compare phaedr euthyph republic




the second question whether plato meant to represent socrates as braving or

irritating his judges must also be answered in the negative his irony his

superiority his audacity regarding not the person of man

necessarily flow out of the loftiness of his situation he is not acting a part

upon a great occasion but he is what he has been all his life long a

king of men he would rather not appear insolent if he could avoid it

ouch os authadizomenos touto lego neither is he desirous of hastening his

own end for life and death are simply indifferent to him but such a defence

as would be acceptable to his judges and might procure an acquittal it is not

in his nature to make he will not say or do anything that might pervert the

course of justice he cannot have his tongue bound even in the throat of

death with his accusers he will only fence and play as he had fenced

with other improvers of youth answering the sophist according to

his sophistry all his life long he is serious when he is speaking of his own

mission which seems to distinguish him from all other reformers of mankind

and originates in an accident the dedication of himself to the improvement of

his fellowcitizens is not so remarkable as the ironical spirit in which he

goes about doing good only in vindication of the credit of the oracle and in

the vain hope of finding a wiser man than himself yet this singular and almost

accidental character of his mission agrees with the divine sign which

according to our notions is equally accidental and irrational and is

nevertheless accepted by him as the guiding principle of his life socrates is

nowhere represented to us as a freethinker or sceptic there is no reason to

doubt his sincerity when he speculates on the possibility of seeing and knowing

the heroes of the trojan war in another world on the other hand his hope of

immortality is uncertainhe also conceives of death as a long sleep in

this respect differing from the phdo and at last falls back on resignation

to the divine will and the certainty that no evil can happen to the good man

either in life or death his absolute truthfulness seems to hinder him from

asserting positively more than this and he makes no attempt to veil his

ignorance in mythology and figures of speech the gentleness of the first part

of the speech contrasts with the aggravated almost threatening tone of the

conclusion he characteristically remarks that he will not speak as a

rhetorician that is to say he will not make a regular defence such as lysias

or one of the orators might have composed for him or according to some

accounts did compose for him but he first procures himself a hearing by

conciliatory words he does not attack the sophists for they were open to the

same charges as himself they were equally ridiculed by the comic poets and

almost equally hateful to anytus and meletus yet incidentally the antagonism

between socrates and the sophists is allowed to appear he is poor and they are

rich his profession that he teaches nothing is opposed to their readiness to

teach all things his talking in the marketplace to their private instructions

his tarryathome life to their wandering from city to city the tone which he

assumes towards them is one of real friendliness but also of concealed irony

towards anaxagoras who had disappointed him in his hopes of learning about

mind and nature he shows a less kindly feeling which is also the feeling of

plato in other passages laws but anaxagoras had been dead thirty years and

was beyond the reach of persecution




it has been remarked that the prophecy of a new generation of teachers who

would rebuke and exhort the athenian people in harsher and more violent terms

was as far as we know never fulfilled no inference can be drawn from this

circumstance as to the probability of the words attributed to him having been

actually uttered they express the aspiration of the first martyr of

philosophy that he would leave behind him many followers accompanied by the

not unnatural feeling that they would be fiercer and more inconsiderate in

their words when emancipated from his control




the above remarks must be understood as applying with any degree of certainty

to the platonic socrates only for although these or similar words may have

been spoken by socrates himself we cannot exclude the possibility that like

so much else eg the wisdom of critias the poem of solon the virtues

of charmides they may have been due only to the imagination of plato the

arguments of those who maintain that the apology was composed during the

process resting on no evidence do not require a serious refutation nor are

the reasonings of schleiermacher who argues that the platonic defence is an

exact or nearly exact reproduction of the words of socrates partly because

plato would not have been guilty of the impiety of altering them and also

because many points of the defence might have been improved and strengthened

at all more conclusive see english translation what effect the death of

socrates produced on the mind of plato we cannot certainly determine nor can

we say how he would or must have written under the circumstances we observe

that the enmity of aristophanes to socrates does not prevent plato from

introducing them together in the symposium engaged in friendly intercourse nor

is there any trace in the dialogues of an attempt to make anytus or meletus

personally odious in the eyes of the athenian public




apology


how you o athenians have been affected by my accusers i cannot tell but i

know that they almost made me forget who i wasso persuasively did they

speak and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth but of the many

falsehoods told by them there was one which quite amazed mei mean when

they said that you should be upon your guard and not allow yourselves to be

deceived by the force of my eloquence to say this when they were certain to

be detected as soon as i opened my lips and proved myself to be anything but a

great speaker did indeed appear to me most shamelessunless by the force

of eloquence they mean the force of truth for if such is their meaning i

admit that i am eloquent but in how different a way from theirs well as i

was saying they have scarcely spoken the truth at all but from me you shall

hear the whole truth not however delivered after their manner in a set

oration duly ornamented with words and phrases no by heaven but i shall use

the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment for i am confident in

the justice of my cause or i am certain that i am right in taking this

course at my time of life i ought not to be appearing before you o men of

athens in the character of a juvenile oratorlet no one expect it of me

and i must beg of you to grant me a favourif i defend myself in my

accustomed manner and you hear me using the words which i have been in the

habit of using in the agora at the tables of the moneychangers or anywhere

else i would ask you not to be surprised and not to interrupt me on this

account for i am more than seventy years of age and appearing now for the

first time in a court of law i am quite a stranger to the language of the

place and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger

whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion

of his countryam i making an unfair request of you never mind the

manner which may or may not be good but think only of the truth of my words

and give heed to that let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly




and first i have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers and

then i will go on to the later ones for of old i have had many accusers who

have accused me falsely to you during many years and i am more afraid of them

than of anytus and his associates who are dangerous too in their own way

but far more dangerous are the others who began when you were children and

took possession of your minds with their falsehoods telling of one socrates a

wise man who speculated about the heaven above and searched into the earth

beneath and made the worse appear the better cause the disseminators of this

tale are the accusers whom i dread for their hearers are apt to fancy that

such enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods and they are many

and their charges against me are of ancient date and they were made by them in

the days when you were more impressible than you are nowin childhood or

it may have been in youthand the cause when heard went by default for

there was none to answer and hardest of all i do not know and cannot tell the

names of my accusers unless in the chance case of a comic poet all who from

envy and malice have persuaded yousome of them having first convinced

themselvesall this class of men are most difficult to deal with for i

cannot have them up here and crossexamine them and therefore i must simply

fight with shadows in my own defence and argue when there is no one who

answers i will ask you then to assume with me as i was saying that my

opponents are of two kinds one recent the other ancient and i hope that you

will see the propriety of my answering the latter first for these accusations

you heard long before the others and much oftener




well then i must make my defence and endeavour to clear away in a short

time a slander which has lasted a long time may i succeed if to succeed be

for my good and yours or likely to avail me in my cause the task is not an

easy one i quite understand the nature of it and so leaving the event with

god in obedience to the law i will now make my defence




i will begin at the beginning and ask what is the accusation which has given

rise to the slander of me and in fact has encouraged meletus to proof this

charge against me well what do the slanderers say they shall be my

prosecutors and i will sum up their words in an affidavit socrates is

an evildoer and a curious person who searches into things under the earth

and in heaven and he makes the worse appear the better cause and he teaches

the aforesaid doctrines to others such is the nature of the accusation

it is just what you have yourselves seen in the comedy of aristophanes

aristoph clouds who has introduced a man whom he calls socrates going

about and saying that he walks in air and talking a deal of nonsense

concerning matters of which i do not pretend to know either much or

littlenot that i mean to speak disparagingly of any one who is a student

of natural philosophy i should be very sorry if meletus could bring so grave a

charge against me but the simple truth is o athenians that i have nothing to

do with physical speculations very many of those here present are witnesses to

the truth of this and to them i appeal speak then you who have heard me and

tell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few

words or in many upon such mattersyou hear their answer and from what they

say of this part of the charge you will be able to judge of the truth of the

rest




as little foundation is there for the report that i am a teacher and take

money this accusation has no more truth in it than the other although if a

man were really able to instruct mankind to receive money for giving

instruction would in my opinion be an honour to him there is gorgias of

leontium and prodicus of ceos and hippias of elis who go the round of the

cities and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens by

whom they might be taught for nothing and come to them whom they not only pay

but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them there is at this time a

parian philosopher residing in athens of whom i have heard and i came to hear

of him in this wayi came across a man who has spent a world of money on

the sophists callias the son of hipponicus and knowing that he had sons i

asked him callias i said if your two sons were foals or

calves there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them we

should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably who would improve and

perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence but as they are human

beings whom are you thinking of placing over them is there any one who

understands human and political virtue you must have thought about the matter

for you have sons is there any one there is he said

who is he said i and of what country and what does he

charge evenus the parian he replied he is the

man and his charge is five min happy is evenus i said to myself if

he really has this wisdom and teaches at such a moderate charge had i the

same i should have been very proud and conceited but the truth is that i have

no knowledge of the kind




i dare say athenians that some one among you will reply yes

socrates but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought against

you there must have been something strange which you have been doing all

these rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had been

like other men tell us then what is the cause of them for we should be

sorry to judge hastily of you now i regard this as a fair challenge

and i will endeavour to explain to you the reason why i am called wise and have

such an evil fame please to attend then and although some of you may think

that i am joking i declare that i will tell you the entire truth men of

athens this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which i

possess if you ask me what kind of wisdom i reply wisdom such as may perhaps

be attained by man for to that extent i am inclined to believe that i am wise

whereas the persons of whom i was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which i may

fail to describe because i have it not myself and he who says that i have

speaks falsely and is taking away my character and here o men of athens i

must beg you not to interrupt me even if i seem to say something extravagant

for the word which i will speak is not mine i will refer you to a witness who

is worthy of credit that witness shall be the god of delphihe will tell

you about my wisdom if i have any and of what sort it is you must have known

chaerephon he was early a friend of mine and also a friend of yours for he

shared in the recent exile of the people and returned with you well

chaerephon as you know was very impetuous in all his doings and he went to

delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whetheras i was saying i

must beg you not to interrupthe asked the oracle to tell him whether

anyone was wiser than i was and the pythian prophetess answered that there

was no man wiser chaerephon is dead himself but his brother who is in court

will confirm the truth of what i am saying




why do i mention this because i am going to explain to you why i have such an

evil name when i heard the answer i said to myself what can the god mean

and what is the interpretation of his riddle for i know that i have no wisdom

small or great what then can he mean when he says that i am the wisest of men

and yet he is a god and cannot lie that would be against his nature after

long consideration i thought of a method of trying the question i reflected

that if i could only find a man wiser than myself then i might go to the god

with a refutation in my hand i should say to him here is a man who is

wiser than i am but you said that i was the wisest accordingly i went

to one who had the reputation of wisdom and observed himhis name i need

not mention he was a politician whom i selected for examinationand the

result was as follows when i began to talk with him i could not help thinking

that he was not really wise although he was thought wise by many and still

wiser by himself and thereupon i tried to explain to him that he thought

himself wise but was not really wise and the consequence was that he hated

me and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me so i

left him saying to myself as i went away well although i do not suppose

that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good i am better off

than he isfor he knows nothing and thinks that he knows i neither

know nor think that i know in this latter particular then i seem to have

slightly the advantage of him then i went to another who had still higher

pretensions to wisdom and my conclusion was exactly the same whereupon i made

another enemy of him and of many others besides him




then i went to one man after another being not unconscious of the enmity which

i provoked and i lamented and feared this but necessity was laid upon

methe word of god i thought ought to be considered first and i said

to myself go i must to all who appear to know and find out the meaning of the

oracle and i swear to you athenians by the dog i swearfor i must

tell you the truththe result of my mission was just this i found that

the men most in repute were all but the most foolish and that others less

esteemed were really wiser and better i will tell you the tale of my

wanderings and of the herculean labours as i may call them

which i endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable after the

politicians i went to the poets tragic dithyrambic and all sorts and

there i said to myself you will be instantly detected now you will find out

that you are more ignorant than they are accordingly i took them some of the

most elaborate passages in their own writings and asked what was the meaning

of themthinking that they would teach me something will you believe me

i am almost ashamed to confess the truth but i must say that there is hardly a

person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they

did themselves then i knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry but by a

sort of genius and inspiration they are like diviners or soothsayers who also

say many fine things but do not understand the meaning of them the poets

appeared to me to be much in the same case and i further observed that upon

the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men

in other things in which they were not wise so i departed conceiving myself

to be superior to them for the same reason that i was superior to the

politicians




at last i went to the artisans i was conscious that i knew nothing at all as

i may say and i was sure that they knew many fine things and here i was not

mistaken for they did know many things of which i was ignorant and in this

they certainly were wiser than i was but i observed that even the good

artisans fell into the same error as the poetsbecause they were good

workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters and this

defect in them overshadowed their wisdom and therefore i asked myself on

behalf of the oracle whether i would like to be as i was neither having their

knowledge nor their ignorance or like them in both and i made answer to

myself and to the oracle that i was better off as i was




this inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most

dangerous kind and has given occasion also to many calumnies and i am called

wise for my hearers always imagine that i myself possess the wisdom which i

find wanting in others but the truth is o men of athens that god only is

wise and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth

little or nothing he is not speaking of socrates he is only using my name by

way of illustration as if he said he o men is the wisest who like

socrates knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing and so i go about

the world obedient to the god and search and make enquiry into the wisdom of

any one whether citizen or stranger who appears to be wise and if he is not

wise then in vindication of the oracle i show him that he is not wise and my

occupation quite absorbs me and i have no time to give either to any public

matter of interest or to any concern of my own but i am in utter poverty by

reason of my devotion to the god




there is another thingyoung men of the richer classes who have not

much to do come about me of their own accord they like to hear the pretenders

examined and they often imitate me and proceed to examine others there are

plenty of persons as they quickly discover who think that they know

something but really know little or nothing and then those who are examined

by them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me this

confounded socrates they say this villainous misleader of youthand

then if somebody asks them why what evil does he practise or teach they do

not know and cannot tell but in order that they may not appear to be at a

loss they repeat the readymade charges which are used against all

philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth and

having no gods and making the worse appear the better cause for they do not

like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detectedwhich

is the truth and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic and are

drawn up in battle array and have persuasive tongues they have filled your

ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies and this is the reason why my

three accusers meletus and anytus and lycon have set upon me meletus who

has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets anytus on behalf of the

craftsmen and politicians lycon on behalf of the rhetoricians and as i said

at the beginning i cannot expect to get rid of such a mass of calumny all in a

moment and this o men of athens is the truth and the whole truth i have

concealed nothing i have dissembled nothing and yet i know that my plainness

of speech makes them hate me and what is their hatred but a proof that i am

speaking the truthhence has arisen the prejudice against me and this

is the reason of it as you will find out either in this or in any future

enquiry




i have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers i turn

to the second class they are headed by meletus that good man and true lover

of his country as he calls himself against these too i must try to make a

defencelet their affidavit be read it contains something of this kind

it says that socrates is a doer of evil who corrupts the youth and who does

not believe in the gods of the state but has other new divinities of his own

such is the charge and now let us examine the particular counts he says that

i am a doer of evil and corrupt the youth but i say o men of athens that

meletus is a doer of evil in that he pretends to be in earnest when he is only

in jest and is so eager to bring men to trial from a pretended zeal and

interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest and

the truth of this i will endeavour to prove to you




come hither meletus and let me ask a question of you you think a great deal

about the improvement of youth




yes i do




tell the judges then who is their improver for you must know as you have

taken the pains to discover their corrupter and are citing and accusing me

before them speak then and tell the judges who their improver

isobserve meletus that you are silent and have nothing to say but

is not this rather disgraceful and a very considerable proof of what i was

saying that you have no interest in the matter speak up friend and tell us

who their improver is




the laws




but that my good sir is not my meaning i want to know who the person is

who in the first place knows the laws




the judges socrates who are present in court




what do you mean to say meletus that they are able to instruct and improve

youth




certainly they are




what all of them or some only and not others




all of them




by the goddess here that is good news there are plenty of improvers then

and what do you say of the audiencedo they improve them




yes they do




and the senators




yes the senators improve them




but perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt themor do they too

improve them




they improve them




then every athenian improves and elevates them all with the exception of

myself and i alone am their corrupter is that what you affirm




that is what i stoutly affirm




i am very unfortunate if you are right but suppose i ask you a question how

about horses does one man do them harm and all the world good is not the

exact opposite the truth one man is able to do them good or at least not

manythe trainer of horses that is to say does them good and others

who have to do with them rather injure them is not that true meletus of

horses or of any other animals most assuredly it is whether you and anytus

say yes or no happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one

corrupter only and all the rest of the world were their improvers but you

meletus have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought about the young

your carelessness is seen in your not caring about the very things which you

bring against me




and now meletus i will ask you another questionby zeus i will which

is better to live among bad citizens or among good ones answer friend i

say the question is one which may be easily answered do not the good do their

neighbours good and the bad do them evil




certainly




and is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those who

live with him answer my good friend the law requires you to

answerdoes any one like to be injured




certainly not




and when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth do you allege

that i corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally




intentionally i say




but you have just admitted that the good do their neighbours good and the evil

do them evil now is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized

thus early in life and am i at my age in such darkness and ignorance as not

to know that if a man with whom i have to live is corrupted by me i am very

likely to be harmed by him and yet i corrupt him and intentionally

tooso you say although neither i nor any other human being is ever

likely to be convinced by you but either i do not corrupt them or i corrupt

them unintentionally and on either view of the case you lie if my offence is

unintentional the law has no cognizance of unintentional offences you ought

to have taken me privately and warned and admonished me for if i had been

better advised i should have left off doing what i only did

unintentionallyno doubt i should but you would have nothing to say to

me and refused to teach me and now you bring me up in this court which is a

place not of instruction but of punishment




it will be very clear to you athenians as i was saying that meletus has no

care at all great or small about the matter but still i should like to know

meletus in what i am affirmed to corrupt the young i suppose you mean as i

infer from your indictment that i teach them not to acknowledge the gods which

the state acknowledges but some other new divinities or spiritual agencies in

their stead these are the lessons by which i corrupt the youth as you say




yes that i say emphatically




then by the gods meletus of whom we are speaking tell me and the court in

somewhat plainer terms what you mean for i do not as yet understand whether

you affirm that i teach other men to acknowledge some gods and therefore that

i do believe in gods and am not an entire atheistthis you do not lay to

my chargebut only you say that they are not the same gods which the

city recognizesthe charge is that they are different gods or do you

mean that i am an atheist simply and a teacher of atheism




i mean the latterthat you are a complete atheist




what an extraordinary statement why do you think so meletus do you mean that

i do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon like other men




i assure you judges that he does not for he says that the sun is stone and

the moon earth




friend meletus you think that you are accusing anaxagoras and you have but a

bad opinion of the judges if you fancy them illiterate to such a degree as not

to know that these doctrines are found in the books of anaxagoras the

clazomenian which are full of them and so forsooth the youth are said to be

taught them by socrates when there are not unfrequently exhibitions of them at

the theatre probably in allusion to aristophanes who caricatured and to

euripides who borrowed the notions of anaxagoras as well as to other dramatic

poets price of admission one drachma at the most and they might pay their

money and laugh at socrates if he pretends to father these extraordinary

views and so meletus you really think that i do not believe in any god




i swear by zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all




nobody will believe you meletus and i am pretty sure that you do not believe

yourself i cannot help thinking men of athens that meletus is reckless and

impudent and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere

wantonness and youthful bravado has he not compounded a riddle thinking to

try me he said to himselfi shall see whether the wise socrates will

discover my facetious contradiction or whether i shall be able to deceive him

and the rest of them for he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself

in the indictment as much as if he said that socrates is guilty of not

believing in the gods and yet of believing in thembut this is not like

a person who is in earnest




i should like you o men of athens to join me in examining what i conceive to

be his inconsistency and do you meletus answer and i must remind the

audience of my request that they would not make a disturbance if i speak in my

accustomed manner




did ever man meletus believe in the existence of human things and not of

human beingsi wish men of athens that he would answer and not be always

trying to get up an interruption did ever any man believe in horsemanship and

not in horses or in fluteplaying and not in fluteplayers no my friend i

will answer to you and to the court as you refuse to answer for yourself

there is no man who ever did but now please to answer the next question can a

man believe in spiritual and divine agencies and not in spirits or demigods




he cannot




how lucky i am to have extracted that answer by the assistance of the court

but then you swear in the indictment that i teach and believe in divine or

spiritual agencies new or old no matter for that at any rate i believe in

spiritual agenciesso you say and swear in the affidavit and yet if i

believe in divine beings how can i help believing in spirits or

demigodsmust i not to be sure i must and therefore i may assume that

your silence gives consent now what are spirits or demigods are they not

either gods or the sons of gods




certainly they are




but this is what i call the facetious riddle invented by you the demigods or

spirits are gods and you say first that i do not believe in gods and then

again that i do believe in gods that is if i believe in demigods for if the

demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods whether by the nymphs or by any

other mothers of whom they are said to be the sonswhat human being will

ever believe that there are no gods if they are the sons of gods you might as

well affirm the existence of mules and deny that of horses and asses such

nonsense meletus could only have been intended by you to make trial of me

you have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real of which to

accuse me but no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be

convinced by you that the same men can believe in divine and superhuman things

and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes




i have said enough in answer to the charge of meletus any elaborate defence is

unnecessary but i know only too well how many are the enmities which i have

incurred and this is what will be my destruction if i am destroyednot

meletus nor yet anytus but the envy and detraction of the world which has

been the death of many good men and will probably be the death of many more

there is no danger of my being the last of them




some one will say and are you not ashamed socrates of a course of life which

is likely to bring you to an untimely end to him i may fairly answer there

you are mistaken a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the

chance of living or dying he ought only to consider whether in doing anything

he is doing right or wrongacting the part of a good man or of a bad

whereas upon your view the heroes who fell at troy were not good for much

and the son of thetis above all who altogether despised danger in comparison

with disgrace and when he was so eager to slay hector his goddess mother said

to him that if he avenged his companion patroclus and slew hector he would

die himselffate she said in these or the like words

waits for you next after hector he receiving this warning

utterly despised danger and death and instead of fearing them feared rather

to live in dishonour and not to avenge his friend let me die

forthwith he replies and be avenged of my enemy rather than

abide here by the beaked ships a laughingstock and a burden of the

earth had achilles any thought of death and danger for wherever a

mans place is whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he

has been placed by a commander there he ought to remain in the hour of danger

he should not think of death or of anything but of disgrace and this o men of

athens is a true saying




strange indeed would be my conduct o men of athens if i who when i was

ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at potidaea and amphipolis

and delium remained where they placed me like any other man facing

deathif now when as i conceive and imagine god orders me to fulfil

the philosophers mission of searching into myself and other men i were

to desert my post through fear of death or any other fear that would indeed

be strange and i might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence

of the gods if i disobeyed the oracle because i was afraid of death fancying

that i was wise when i was not wise for the fear of death is indeed the

pretence of wisdom and not real wisdom being a pretence of knowing the

unknown and no one knows whether death which men in their fear apprehend to

be the greatest evil may not be the greatest good is not this ignorance of a

disgraceful sort the ignorance which is the conceit that a man knows what he

does not know and in this respect only i believe myself to differ from men in

general and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they arethat whereas i

know but little of the world below i do not suppose that i know but i do know

that injustice and disobedience to a better whether god or man is evil and

dishonourable and i will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a

certain evil and therefore if you let me go now and are not convinced by

anytus who said that since i had been prosecuted i must be put to death or

if not that i ought never to have been prosecuted at all and that if i escape

now your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my wordsif you

say to me socrates this time we will not mind anytus and you shall be let

off but upon one condition that you are not to enquire and speculate in this

way any more and that if you are caught doing so again you shall dieif

this was the condition on which you let me go i should reply men of athens i

honour and love you but i shall obey god rather than you and while i have

life and strength i shall never cease from the practice and teaching of

philosophy exhorting any one whom i meet and saying to him after my manner

you my frienda citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of

athensare you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money

and honour and reputation and caring so little about wisdom and truth and the

greatest improvement of the soul which you never regard or heed at all and if

the person with whom i am arguing says yes but i do care then i do not

leave him or let him go at once but i proceed to interrogate and examine and

crossexamine him and if i think that he has no virtue in him but only says

that he has i reproach him with undervaluing the greater and overvaluing the

less and i shall repeat the same words to every one whom i meet young and

old citizen and alien but especially to the citizens inasmuch as they are my

brethren for know that this is the command of god and i believe that no

greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the god for i

do nothing but go about persuading you all old and young alike not to take

thought for your persons or your properties but first and chiefly to care

about the greatest improvement of the soul i tell you that virtue is not given

by money but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man public

as well as private this is my teaching and if this is the doctrine which

corrupts the youth i am a mischievous person but if any one says that this is

not my teaching he is speaking an untruth wherefore o men of athens i say

to you do as anytus bids or not as anytus bids and either acquit me or not

but whichever you do understand that i shall never alter my ways not even if

i have to die many times




men of athens do not interrupt but hear me there was an understanding

between us that you should hear me to the end i have something more to say at

which you may be inclined to cry out but i believe that to hear me will be

good for you and therefore i beg that you will not cry out i would have you

know that if you kill such an one as i am you will injure yourselves more

than you will injure me nothing will injure me not meletus nor yet

anytusthey cannot for a bad man is not permitted to injure a better

than himself i do not deny that anytus may perhaps kill him or drive him

into exile or deprive him of civil rights and he may imagine and others may

imagine that he is inflicting a great injury upon him but there i do not

agree for the evil of doing as he is doingthe evil of unjustly taking

away the life of anotheris greater far




and now athenians i am not going to argue for my own sake as you may think

but for yours that you may not sin against the god by condemning me who am

his gift to you for if you kill me you will not easily find a successor to me

who if i may use such a ludicrous figure of speech am a sort of gadfly given

to the state by god and the state is a great and noble steed who is tardy in

his motions owing to his very size and requires to be stirred into life i am

that gadfly which god has attached to the state and all day long and in all

places am always fastening upon you arousing and persuading and reproaching

you you will not easily find another like me and therefore i would advise you

to spare me i dare say that you may feel out of temper like a person who is

suddenly awakened from sleep and you think that you might easily strike me

dead as anytus advises and then you would sleep on for the remainder of your

lives unless god in his care of you sent you another gadfly when i say that i

am given to you by god the proof of my mission is thisif i had been

like other men i should not have neglected all my own concerns or patiently

seen the neglect of them during all these years and have been doing yours

coming to you individually like a father or elder brother exhorting you to

regard virtue such conduct i say would be unlike human nature if i had

gained anything or if my exhortations had been paid there would have been

some sense in my doing so but now as you will perceive not even the

impudence of my accusers dares to say that i have ever exacted or sought pay of

any one of that they have no witness and i have a sufficient witness to the

truth of what i saymy poverty




some one may wonder why i go about in private giving advice and busying myself

with the concerns of others but do not venture to come forward in public and

advise the state i will tell you why you have heard me speak at sundry times

and in divers places of an oracle or sign which comes to me and is the

divinity which meletus ridicules in the indictment this sign which is a kind

of voice first began to come to me when i was a child it always forbids but

never commands me to do anything which i am going to do this is what deters me

from being a politician and rightly as i think for i am certain o men of

athens that if i had engaged in politics i should have perished long ago and

done no good either to you or to myself and do not be offended at my telling

you the truth for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or any

other multitude honestly striving against the many lawless and unrighteous

deeds which are done in a state will save his life he who will fight for the

right if he would live even for a brief space must have a private station and

not a public one




i can give you convincing evidence of what i say not words only but what you

value far moreactions let me relate to you a passage of my own life

which will prove to you that i should never have yielded to injustice from any

fear of death and that as i should have refused to yield i must

have died at once i will tell you a tale of the courts not very interesting

perhaps but nevertheless true the only office of state which i ever held o

men of athens was that of senator the tribe antiochis which is my tribe had

the presidency at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of

the slain after the battle of arginusae and you proposed to try them in a

body contrary to law as you all thought afterwards but at the time i was the

only one of the prytanes who was opposed to the illegality and i gave my vote

against you and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest me and you

called and shouted i made up my mind that i would run the risk having law and

justice with me rather than take part in your injustice because i feared

imprisonment and death this happened in the days of the democracy but when

the oligarchy of the thirty was in power they sent for me and four others into

the rotunda and bade us bring leon the salaminian from salamis as they wanted

to put him to death this was a specimen of the sort of commands which they

were always giving with the view of implicating as many as possible in their

crimes and then i showed not in word only but in deed that if i may be

allowed to use such an expression i cared not a straw for death and that my

great and only care was lest i should do an unrighteous or unholy thing for

the strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong

and when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to salamis and fetched

leon but i went quietly home for which i might have lost my life had not the

power of the thirty shortly afterwards come to an end and many will witness to

my words




now do you really imagine that i could have survived all these years if i had

led a public life supposing that like a good man i had always maintained the

right and had made justice as i ought the first thing no indeed men of

athens neither i nor any other man but i have been always the same in all my

actions public as well as private and never have i yielded any base

compliance to those who are slanderously termed my disciples or to any other

not that i have any regular disciples but if any one likes to come and hear me

while i am pursuing my mission whether he be young or old he is not excluded

nor do i converse only with those who pay but any one whether he be rich or

poor may ask and answer me and listen to my words and whether he turns out to

be a bad man or a good one neither result can be justly imputed to me for i

never taught or professed to teach him anything and if any one says that he

has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all the world has

not heard let me tell you that he is lying




but i shall be asked why do people delight in continually conversing with you

i have told you already athenians the whole truth about this matter they

like to hear the crossexamination of the pretenders to wisdom there is

amusement in it now this duty of crossexamining other men has been imposed

upon me by god and has been signified to me by oracles visions and in every

way in which the will of divine power was ever intimated to any one this is

true o athenians or if not true would be soon refuted if i am or have been

corrupting the youth those of them who are now grown up and have become

sensible that i gave them bad advice in the days of their youth should come

forward as accusers and take their revenge or if they do not like to come

themselves some of their relatives fathers brothers or other kinsmen

should say what evil their families have suffered at my hands now is their

time many of them i see in the court there is crito who is of the same age

and of the same deme with myself and there is critobulus his son whom i also

see then again there is lysanias of sphettus who is the father of

aeschineshe is present and also there is antiphon of cephisus who is

the father of epigenes and there are the brothers of several who have

associated with me there is nicostratus the son of theosdotides and the

brother of theodotus now theodotus himself is dead and therefore he at any

rate will not seek to stop him and there is paralus the son of demodocus

who had a brother theages and adeimantus the son of ariston whose brother

plato is present and aeantodorus who is the brother of apollodorus whom i

also see i might mention a great many others some of whom meletus should have

produced as witnesses in the course of his speech and let him still produce

them if he has forgotteni will make way for him and let him say if he

has any testimony of the sort which he can produce nay athenians the very

opposite is the truth for all these are ready to witness on behalf of the

corrupter of the injurer of their kindred as meletus and anytus call me not

the corrupted youth onlythere might have been a motive for

thatbut their uncorrupted elder relatives why should they too support

me with their testimony why indeed except for the sake of truth and justice

and because they know that i am speaking the truth and that meletus is a liar




well athenians this and the like of this is all the defence which i have to

offer yet a word more perhaps there may be some one who is offended at me

when he calls to mind how he himself on a similar or even a less serious

occasion prayed and entreated the judges with many tears and how he produced

his children in court which was a moving spectacle together with a host of

relations and friends whereas i who am probably in danger of my life will do

none of these things the contrast may occur to his mind and he may be set

against me and vote in anger because he is displeased at me on this account

now if there be such a person among youmind i do not say that there

isto him i may fairly reply my friend i am a man and like other men

a creature of flesh and blood and not of wood or stone as homer

says and i have a family yes and sons o athenians three in number one

almost a man and two others who are still young and yet i will not bring any

of them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal and why not not from

any selfassertion or want of respect for you whether i am or am not afraid of

death is another question of which i will not now speak but having regard to

public opinion i feel that such conduct would be discreditable to myself and

to you and to the whole state one who has reached my years and who has a

name for wisdom ought not to demean himself whether this opinion of me be

deserved or not at any rate the world has decided that socrates is in some way

superior to other men and if those among you who are said to be superior in

wisdom and courage and any other virtue demean themselves in this way how

shameful is their conduct i have seen men of reputation when they have been

condemned behaving in the strangest manner they seemed to fancy that they

were going to suffer something dreadful if they died and that they could be

immortal if you only allowed them to live and i think that such are a

dishonour to the state and that any stranger coming in would have said of them

that the most eminent men of athens to whom the athenians themselves give

honour and command are no better than women and i say that these things ought

not to be done by those of us who have a reputation and if they are done you

ought not to permit them you ought rather to show that you are far more

disposed to condemn the man who gets up a doleful scene and makes the city

ridiculous than him who holds his peace




but setting aside the question of public opinion there seems to be something

wrong in asking a favour of a judge and thus procuring an acquittal instead

of informing and convincing him for his duty is not to make a present of

justice but to give judgment and he has sworn that he will judge according to

the laws and not according to his own good pleasure and we ought not to

encourage you nor should you allow yourselves to be encouraged in this habit

of perjurythere can be no piety in that do not then require me to do

what i consider dishonourable and impious and wrong especially now when i am

being tried for impiety on the indictment of meletus for if o men of athens

by force of persuasion and entreaty i could overpower your oaths then i should

be teaching you to believe that there are no gods and in defending should

simply convict myself of the charge of not believing in them but that is not

sofar otherwise for i do believe that there are gods and in a sense

higher than that in which any of my accusers believe in them and to you and to

god i commit my cause to be determined by you as is best for you and me





there are many reasons why i am not grieved o men of athens at the vote of

condemnation i expected it and am only surprised that the votes are so nearly

equal for i had thought that the majority against me would have been far

larger but now had thirty votes gone over to the other side i should have

been acquitted and i may say i think that i have escaped meletus i may say

more for without the assistance of anytus and lycon any one may see that he

would not have had a fifth part of the votes as the law requires in which

case he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae




and so he proposes death as the penalty and what shall i propose on my part o

men of athens clearly that which is my due and what is my due what return

shall be made to the man who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole

life but has been careless of what the many care forwealth and family

interests and military offices and speaking in the assembly and

magistracies and plots and parties reflecting that i was really too honest a

man to be a politician and live i did not go where i could do no good to you

or to myself but where i could do the greatest good privately to every one of

you thither i went and sought to persuade every man among you that he must

look to himself and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private

interests and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state

and that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions what

shall be done to such an one doubtless some good thing o men of athens if he

has his reward and the good should be of a kind suitable to him what would be

a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor and who desires leisure

that he may instruct you there can be no reward so fitting as maintenance in

the prytaneum o men of athens a reward which he deserves far more than the

citizen who has won the prize at olympia in the horse or chariot race whether

the chariots were drawn by two horses or by many for i am in want and he has

enough and he only gives you the appearance of happiness and i give you the

reality and if i am to estimate the penalty fairly i should say that

maintenance in the prytaneum is the just return




perhaps you think that i am braving you in what i am saying now as in what i

said before about the tears and prayers but this is not so i speak rather

because i am convinced that i never intentionally wronged any one although i

cannot convince youthe time has been too short if there were a law at

athens as there is in other cities that a capital cause should not be decided

in one day then i believe that i should have convinced you but i cannot in a

moment refute great slanders and as i am convinced that i never wronged

another i will assuredly not wrong myself i will not say of myself that i

deserve any evil or propose any penalty why should i because i am afraid of

the penalty of death which meletus proposes when i do not know whether death

is a good or an evil why should i propose a penalty which would certainly be

an evil shall i say imprisonment and why should i live in prison and be the

slave of the magistrates of the yearof the eleven or shall the penalty

be a fine and imprisonment until the fine is paid there is the same

objection i should have to lie in prison for money i have none and cannot

pay and if i say exile and this may possibly be the penalty which you will

affix i must indeed be blinded by the love of life if i am so irrational as

to expect that when you who are my own citizens cannot endure my discourses

and words and have found them so grievous and odious that you will have no

more of them others are likely to endure me no indeed men of athens that is

not very likely and what a life should i lead at my age wandering from city

to city ever changing my place of exile and always being driven out for i am

quite sure that wherever i go there as here the young men will flock to me

and if i drive them away their elders will drive me out at their request and

if i let them come their fathers and friends will drive me out for their

sakes




some one will say yes socrates but cannot you hold your tongue and then you

may go into a foreign city and no one will interfere with you now i have

great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this for if i tell you

that to do as you say would be a disobedience to the god and therefore that i

cannot hold my tongue you will not believe that i am serious and if i say

again that daily to discourse about virtue and of those other things about

which you hear me examining myself and others is the greatest good of man and

that the unexamined life is not worth living you are still less likely to

believe me yet i say what is true although a thing of which it is hard for me

to persuade you also i have never been accustomed to think that i deserve to

suffer any harm had i money i might have estimated the offence at what i was

able to pay and not have been much the worse but i have none and therefore i

must ask you to proportion the fine to my means well perhaps i could afford a

mina and therefore i propose that penalty plato crito critobulus and

apollodorus my friends here bid me say thirty min and they will be the

sureties let thirty min be the penalty for which sum they will be ample

security to you





not much time will be gained o athenians in return for the evil name which

you will get from the detractors of the city who will say that you killed

socrates a wise man for they will call me wise even although i am not wise

when they want to reproach you if you had waited a little while your desire

would have been fulfilled in the course of nature for i am far advanced in

years as you may perceive and not far from death i am speaking now not to

all of you but only to those who have condemned me to death and i have

another thing to say to them you think that i was convicted because i had no

words of the sort which would have procured my acquittali mean if i had

thought fit to leave nothing undone or unsaid not so the deficiency which led

to my conviction was not of wordscertainly not but i had not the

boldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me

to do weeping and wailing and lamenting and saying and doing many things

which you have been accustomed to hear from others and which as i maintain

are unworthy of me i thought at the time that i ought not to do anything

common or mean when in danger nor do i now repent of the style of my defence

i would rather die having spoken after my manner than speak in your manner and

live for neither in war nor yet at law ought i or any man to use every way of

escaping death often in battle there can be no doubt that if a man will throw

away his arms and fall on his knees before his pursuers he may escape death

and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death if a man is

willing to say and do anything the difficulty my friends is not to avoid

death but to avoid unrighteousness for that runs faster than death i am old

and move slowly and the slower runner has overtaken me and my accusers are

keen and quick and the faster runner who is unrighteousness has overtaken

them and now i depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of

deaththey too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the

penalty of villainy and wrong and i must abide by my awardlet them

abide by theirs i suppose that these things may be regarded as

fatedand i think that they are well




and now o men who have condemned me i would fain prophesy to you for i am

about to die and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic power and

i prophesy to you who are my murderers that immediately after my departure

punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you me

you have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser and not to give an

account of your lives but that will not be as you suppose far otherwise for

i say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now accusers whom

hitherto i have restrained and as they are younger they will be more

inconsiderate with you and you will be more offended at them if you think

that by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives

you are mistaken that is not a way of escape which is either possible or

honourable the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others but

to be improving yourselves this is the prophecy which i utter before my

departure to the judges who have condemned me




friends who would have acquitted me i would like also to talk with you about

the thing which has come to pass while the magistrates are busy and before i

go to the place at which i must die stay then a little for we may as well

talk with one another while there is time you are my friends and i should

like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me o my

judgesfor you i may truly call judgesi should like to tell you of

a wonderful circumstance hitherto the divine faculty of which the internal

oracle is the source has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even about

trifles if i was going to make a slip or error in any matter and now as you

see there has come upon me that which may be thought and is generally believed

to be the last and worst evil but the oracle made no sign of opposition

either when i was leaving my house in the morning or when i was on my way to

the court or while i was speaking at anything which i was going to say and

yet i have often been stopped in the middle of a speech but now in nothing i

either said or did touching the matter in hand has the oracle opposed me what

do i take to be the explanation of this silence i will tell you it is an

intimation that what has happened to me is a good and that those of us who

think that death is an evil are in error for the customary sign would surely

have opposed me had i been going to evil and not to good




let us reflect in another way and we shall see that there is great reason to

hope that death is a good for one of two thingseither death is a state

of nothingness and utter unconsciousness or as men say there is a change and

migration of the soul from this world to another now if you suppose that there

is no consciousness but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even

by dreams death will be an unspeakable gain for if a person were to select

the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams and were to

compare with this the other days and nights of his life and then were to tell

us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and

more pleasantly than this one i think that any man i will not say a private

man but even the great king will not find many such days or nights when

compared with the others now if death be of such a nature i say that to die

is gain for eternity is then only a single night but if death is the journey

to another place and there as men say all the dead abide what good o my

friends and judges can be greater than this if indeed when the pilgrim

arrives in the world below he is delivered from the professors of justice in

this world and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there

minos and rhadamanthus and aeacus and triptolemus and other sons of god who

were righteous in their own life that pilgrimage will be worth making what

would not a man give if he might converse with orpheus and musaeus and hesiod

and homer nay if this be true let me die again and again i myself too

shall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with palamedes

and ajax the son of telamon and any other ancient hero who has suffered death

through an unjust judgment and there will be no small pleasure as i think in

comparing my own sufferings with theirs above all i shall then be able to

continue my search into true and false knowledge as in this world so also in

the next and i shall find out who is wise and who pretends to be wise and is

not what would not a man give o judges to be able to examine the leader of

the great trojan expedition or odysseus or sisyphus or numberless others men

and women too what infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and

asking them questions in another world they do not put a man to death for

asking questions assuredly not for besides being happier than we are they

will be immortal if what is said is true




wherefore o judges be of good cheer about death and know of a certainty

that no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death he and

his are not neglected by the gods nor has my own approaching end happened by

mere chance but i see clearly that the time had arrived when it was better for

me to die and be released from trouble wherefore the oracle gave no sign for

which reason also i am not angry with my condemners or with my accusers

they have done me no harm although they did not mean to do me any good and

for this i may gently blame them




still i have a favour to ask of them when my sons are grown up i would ask

you o my friends to punish them and i would have you trouble them as i have

troubled you if they seem to care about riches or anything more than about

virtue or if they pretend to be something when they are really

nothingthen reprove them as i have reproved you for not caring about

 gorgias




introduction


in several of the dialogues of plato doubts have arisen among his interpreters

as to which of the various subjects discussed in them is the main thesis the

speakers have the freedom of conversation no severe rules of art restrict

them and sometimes we are inclined to think with one of the dramatis personae

in the theaetetus that the digressions have the greater interest yet in the

most irregular of the dialogues there is also a certain natural growth or

unity the beginning is not forgotten at the end and numerous allusions and

references are interspersed which form the loose connecting links of the

whole we must not neglect this unity but neither must we attempt to confine

the platonic dialogue on the procrustean bed of a single idea compare

introduction to the phaedrus




two tendencies seem to have beset the interpreters of plato in this matter

first they have endeavoured to hang the dialogues upon one another by the

slightest threads and have thus been led to opposite and contradictory

assertions respecting their order and sequence the mantle of schleiermacher

has descended upon his successors who have applied his method with the most

various results the value and use of the method has been hardly if at all

examined either by him or them secondly they have extended almost

indefinitely the scope of each separate dialogue in this way they think that

they have escaped all difficulties not seeing that what they have gained in

generality they have lost in truth and distinctness metaphysical conceptions

easily pass into one another and the simpler notions of antiquity which we

can only realize by an effort imperceptibly blend with the more familiar

theories of modern philosophers an eye for proportion is needed his own art

of measuring in the study of plato as well as of other great artists we may

hardly admit that the moral antithesis of good and pleasure or the

intellectual antithesis of knowledge and opinion being and appearance are

never far off in a platonic discussion but because they are in the background

we should not bring them into the foreground or expect to discern them equally

in all the dialogues




there may be some advantage in drawing out a little the main outlines of the

building but the use of this is limited and may be easily exaggerated we may

give plato too much system and alter the natural form and connection of his

thoughts under the idea that his dialogues are finished works of art we may

find a reason for everything and lose the highest characteristic of art which

is simplicity most great works receive a new light from a new and original

mind but whether these new lights are true or only suggestive will depend on

their agreement with the spirit of plato and the amount of direct evidence

which can be urged in support of them when a theory is running away with us

criticism does a friendly office in counselling moderation and recalling us to

the indications of the text




like the phaedrus the gorgias has puzzled students of plato by the appearance

of two or more subjects under the cover of rhetoric higher themes are

introduced the argument expands into a general view of the good and evil of

man after making an ineffectual attempt to obtain a sound definition of his

art from gorgias socrates assumes the existence of a universal art of flattery

or simulation having several branchesthis is the genus of which

rhetoric is only one and not the highest species to flattery is opposed the

true and noble art of life which he who possesses seeks always to impart to

others and which at last triumphs if not here at any rate in another world

these two aspects of life and knowledge appear to be the two leading ideas of

the dialogue the true and the false in individuals and states in the

treatment of the soul as well as of the body are conceived under the forms of

true and false art in the development of this opposition there arise various

other questions such as the two famous paradoxes of socrates paradoxes as

they are to the world in general ideals as they may be more worthily called

 that to do is worse than to suffer evil and  that when a man has done

evil he had better be punished than unpunished to which may be added  a

third socratic paradox or ideal that bad men do what they think best but not

what they desire for the desire of all is towards the good that pleasure is

to be distinguished from good is proved by the simultaneousness of pleasure and

pain and by the possibility of the bad having in certain cases pleasures as

great as those of the good or even greater not merely rhetoricians but

poets musicians and other artists the whole tribe of statesmen past as well

as present are included in the class of flatterers the true and false finally

appear before the judgmentseat of the gods below




the dialogue naturally falls into three divisions to which the three

characters of gorgias polus and callicles respectively correspond and the

form and manner change with the stages of the argument socrates is deferential

towards gorgias playful and yet cutting in dealing with the youthful polus

ironical and sarcastic in his encounter with callicles in the first division

the question is askedwhat is rhetoric to this there is no answer given

for gorgias is soon made to contradict himself by socrates and the argument is

transferred to the hands of his disciple polus who rushes to the defence of

his master the answer has at last to be given by socrates himself but before

he can even explain his meaning to polus he must enlighten him upon the great

subject of shams or flatteries when polus finds his favourite art reduced to

the level of cookery he replies that at any rate rhetoricians like despots

have great power socrates denies that they have any real power and hence

arise the three paradoxes already mentioned although they are strange to him

polus is at last convinced of their truth at least they seem to him to follow

legitimately from the premises thus the second act of the dialogue closes

then callicles appears on the scene at first maintaining that pleasure is

good and that might is right and that law is nothing but the combination of

the many weak against the few strong when he is confuted he withdraws from the

argument and leaves socrates to arrive at the conclusion by himself the

conclusion is that there are two kinds of statesmanship a higher and a

lowerthat which makes the people better and that which only flatters

them and he exhorts callicles to choose the higher the dialogue terminates

with a mythus of a final judgment in which there will be no more flattery or

disguise and no further use for the teaching of rhetoric




the characters of the three interlocutors also correspond to the parts which

are assigned to them gorgias is the great rhetorician now advanced in years

who goes from city to city displaying his talents and is celebrated throughout

greece like all the sophists in the dialogues of plato he is vain and

boastful yet he has also a certain dignity and is treated by socrates with

considerable respect but he is no match for him in dialectics although he has

been teaching rhetoric all his life he is still incapable of defining his own

art when his ideas begin to clear up he is unwilling to admit that rhetoric

can be wholly separated from justice and injustice and this lingering

sentiment of morality or regard for public opinion enables socrates to detect

him in a contradiction like protagoras he is described as of a generous

nature he expresses his approbation of socrates manner of approaching a

question he is quite one of socrates sort ready to be refuted

as well as to refute and very eager that callicles and socrates should

have the game out he knows by experience that rhetoric exercises great

influence over other men but he is unable to explain the puzzle how rhetoric

can teach everything and know nothing




polus is an impetuous youth a runaway colt as socrates

describes him who wanted originally to have taken the place of gorgias under

the pretext that the old man was tired and now avails himself of the earliest

opportunity to enter the lists he is said to be the author of a work on

rhetoric and is again mentioned in the phaedrus as the inventor of balanced

or double forms of speech compare gorg symp at first he is violent and

illmannered and is angry at seeing his master overthrown but in the

judicious hands of socrates he is soon restored to goodhumour and compelled

to assent to the required conclusion like gorgias he is overthrown because he

compromises he is unwilling to say that to do is fairer or more honourable

than to suffer injustice though he is fascinated by the power of rhetoric and

dazzled by the splendour of success he is not insensible to higher arguments

plato may have felt that there would be an incongruity in a youth maintaining

the cause of injustice against the world he has never heard the other side of

the question and he listens to the paradoxes as they appear to him of

socrates with evident astonishment he can hardly understand the meaning of

archelaus being miserable or of rhetoric being only useful in selfaccusation

when the argument with him has fairly run out




callicles in whose house they are assembled is introduced on the stage he is

with difficulty convinced that socrates is in earnest for if these things are

true then as he says with real emotion the foundations of society are upside

down in him another type of character is represented he is neither sophist

nor philosopher but man of the world and an accomplished athenian gentleman

he might be described in modern language as a cynic or materialist a lover of

power and also of pleasure and unscrupulous in his means of attaining both

there is no desire on his part to offer any compromise in the interests of

morality nor is any concession made by him like thrasymachus in the republic

though he is not of the same weak and vulgar class he consistently maintains

that might is right his great motive of action is political ambition in this

he is characteristically greek like anytus in the meno he is the enemy of the

sophists but favours the new art of rhetoric which he regards as an excellent

weapon of attack and defence he is a despiser of mankind as he is of

philosophy and sees in the laws of the state only a violation of the order of

nature which intended that the stronger should govern the weaker compare

republic like other men of the world who are of a speculative turn of mind

he generalizes the bad side of human nature and has easily brought down his

principles to his practice philosophy and poetry alike supply him with

distinctions suited to his view of human life he has a good will to socrates

whose talents he evidently admires while he censures the puerile use which he

makes of them he expresses a keen intellectual interest in the argument like

anytus again he has a sympathy with other men of the world the athenian

statesmen of a former generation who showed no weakness and made no mistakes

such as miltiades themistocles pericles are his favourites his ideal of

human character is a man of great passions and great powers which he has

developed to the utmost and which he uses in his own enjoyment and in the

government of others had critias been the name instead of callicles about

whom we know nothing from other sources the opinions of the man would have

seemed to reflect the history of his life




and now the combat deepens in callicles far more than in any sophist or

rhetorician is concentrated the spirit of evil against which socrates is

contending the spirit of the world the spirit of the many contending against

the one wise man of which the sophists as he describes them in the republic

are the imitators rather than the authors being themselves carried away by the

great tide of public opinion socrates approaches his antagonist warily from a

distance with a sort of irony which touches with a light hand both his

personal vices probably in allusion to some scandal of the day and his

servility to the populace at the same time he is in most profound earnest as

chaerephon remarks callicles soon loses his temper but the more he is

irritated the more provoking and matter of fact does socrates become a

repartee of his which appears to have been really made to the

omniscient hippias according to the testimony of xenophon

mem is introduced he is called by callicles a popular declaimer and

certainly shows that he has the power in the words of gorgias of being

as long as he pleases or as short as he pleases

compare protag callicles exhibits great ability in defending himself and

attacking socrates whom he accuses of trifling and wordsplitting he is

scandalized that the legitimate consequences of his own argument should be

stated in plain terms after the manner of men of the world he wishes to

preserve the decencies of life but he cannot consistently maintain the bad

sense of words and getting confused between the abstract notions of better

superior stronger he is easily turned round by socrates and only induced to

continue the argument by the authority of gorgias once when socrates is

describing the manner in which the ambitious citizen has to identify himself

with the people he partially recognizes the truth of his words




the socrates of the gorgias may be compared with the socrates of the protagoras

and meno as in other dialogues he is the enemy of the sophists and

rhetoricians and also of the statesmen whom he regards as another variety of

the same species his behaviour is governed by that of his opponents the least

forwardness or egotism on their part is met by a corresponding irony on the

part of socrates he must speak for philosophy will not allow him to be

silent he is indeed more ironical and provoking than in any other of

platos writings for he is fooled to the top of his bent

by the worldliness of callicles but he is also more deeply in earnest he

rises higher than even in the phaedo and crito at first enveloping his moral

convictions in a cloud of dust and dialectics he ends by losing his method

his life himself in them as in the protagoras and phaedrus throwing aside

the veil of irony he makes a speech but true to his character not until his

adversary has refused to answer any more questions the presentiment of his own

fate is hanging over him he is aware that socrates the single real teacher of

politics as he ventures to call himself cannot safely go to war with the

whole world and that in the courts of earth he will be condemned but he will

be justified in the world below then the position of socrates and callicles

will be reversed all those things unfit for ears polite which

callicles has prophesied as likely to happen to him in this life the insulting

language the box on the ears will recoil upon his assailant compare

republic and the similar reversal of the position of the lawyer and the

philosopher in the theaetetus




there is an interesting allusion to his own behaviour at the trial of the

generals after the battle of arginusae which he ironically attributes to his

ignorance of the manner in which a vote of the assembly should be taken this

is said to have happened last year bc  and therefore the

assumed date of the dialogue has been fixed at  bc when socrates would

already have been an old man the date is clearly marked but is scarcely

reconcilable with another indication of time viz the recent

usurpation of archelaus which occurred in the year  and still less with

the recent death of pericles who really died twentyfour years

previously  bc and is afterwards reckoned among the statesmen of a past

age or with the mention of nicias who died in  and is nevertheless spoken

of as a living witness but we shall hereafter have reason to observe that

although there is a general consistency of times and persons in the dialogues

of plato a precise dramatic date is an invention of his commentators preface

to republic




the conclusion of the dialogue is remarkable  for the truly characteristic

declaration of socrates that he is ignorant of the true nature and bearing of

these things while he affirms at the same time that no one can maintain any

other view without being ridiculous the profession of ignorance reminds us of

the earlier and more exclusively socratic dialogues but neither in them nor

in the apology nor in the memorabilia of xenophon does socrates express any

doubt of the fundamental truths of morality he evidently regards this

among the multitude of questions which agitate human life

as the principle which alone remains unshaken he does not insist

here any more than in the phaedo on the literal truth of the myth but only

on the soundness of the doctrine which is contained in it that doing wrong is

worse than suffering and that a man should be rather than seem for the next

best thing to a mans being just is that he should be corrected and

become just also that he should avoid all flattery whether of himself or of

others and that rhetoric should be employed for the maintenance of the right

only the revelation of another life is a recapitulation of the argument in a

figure




 socrates makes the singular remark that he is himself the only true

politician of his age in other passages especially in the apology he

disclaims being a politician at all there he is convinced that he or any other

good man who attempted to resist the popular will would be put to death before

he had done any good to himself or others here he anticipates such a fate for

himself from the fact that he is the only man of the present day who

performs his public duties at all the two points of view are not really

inconsistent but the difference between them is worth noticing socrates is

and is not a public man not in the ordinary sense like alcibiades or

pericles but in a higher one and this will sooner or later entail the same

consequences on him he cannot be a private man if he would neither can he

separate morals from politics nor is he unwilling to be a politician although

he foresees the dangers which await him but he must first become a better and

wiser man for he as well as callicles is in a state of perplexity and

uncertainty and yet there is an inconsistency for should not socrates too

have taught the citizens better than to put him to death




and now as he himself says we will resume the argument from the

beginning




socrates who is attended by his inseparable disciple chaerephon meets

callicles in the streets of athens he is informed that he has just missed an

exhibition of gorgias which he regrets because he was desirous not of

hearing gorgias display his rhetoric but of interrogating him concerning the

nature of his art callicles proposes that they shall go with him to his own

house where gorgias is staying there they find the great rhetorician and his

younger friend and disciple polus




socrates put the question to him chaerephon




chaerephon what question




socrates who is hesuch a question as would elicit from a man the

answer i am a cobbler




polus suggests that gorgias may be tired and desires to answer for him

who is gorgias asks chaerephon imitating the manner of his

master socrates one of the best of men and a proficient in the best

and noblest of experimental arts etc replies polus in rhetorical and

balanced phrases socrates is dissatisfied at the length and unmeaningness of

the answer he tells the disconcerted volunteer that he has mistaken the

quality for the nature of the art and remarks to gorgias that polus has

learnt how to make a speech but not how to answer a question he wishes that

gorgias would answer him gorgias is willing enough and replies to the

question asked by chaerephonthat he is a rhetorician and in homeric

language boasts himself to be a good one at the request of

socrates he promises to be brief for he can be as long as he pleases

and as short as he pleases socrates would have him bestow his length on

others and proceeds to ask him a number of questions which are answered by

him to his own great satisfaction and with a brevity which excites the

admiration of socrates the result of the discussion may be summed up as

follows




rhetoric treats of discourse but music and medicine and other particular

arts are also concerned with discourse in what way then does rhetoric differ

from them gorgias draws a distinction between the arts which deal with words

and the arts which have to do with external actions socrates extends this

distinction further and divides all productive arts into two classes  arts

which may be carried on in silence and  arts which have to do with words

or in which words are coextensive with action such as arithmetic geometry

rhetoric but still gorgias could hardly have meant to say that arithmetic was

the same as rhetoric even in the arts which are concerned with words there are

differences what then distinguishes rhetoric from the other arts which have to

do with words the words which rhetoric uses relate to the best and

greatest of human things but tell me gorgias what are the best

health first beauty next wealth third in the words of the old

song or how would you rank them the arts will come to you in a body each

claiming precedence and saying that her own good is superior to that of the

resthow will you choose between them i should say socrates

that the art of persuasion which gives freedom to all men and to individuals

power in the state is the greatest good but what is the exact nature

of this persuasionis the persevering retort you could not describe

zeuxis as a painter or even as a painter of figures if there were other

painters of figures neither can you define rhetoric simply as an art of

persuasion because there are other arts which persuade such as arithmetic

which is an art of persuasion about odd and even numbers gorgias is made to

see the necessity of a further limitation and he now defines rhetoric as the

art of persuading in the law courts and in the assembly about the just and

unjust but still there are two sorts of persuasion one which gives knowledge

and another which gives belief without knowledge and knowledge is always true

but belief may be either true or falsethere is therefore a further

question which of the two sorts of persuasion does rhetoric effect in courts

of law and assemblies plainly that which gives belief and not that which gives

knowledge for no one can impart a real knowledge of such matters to a crowd of

persons in a few minutes and there is another point to be

consideredwhen the assembly meets to advise about walls or docks or

military expeditions the rhetorician is not taken into counsel but the

architect or the general how would gorgias explain this phenomenon all who

intend to become disciples of whom there are several in the company and not

socrates only are eagerly askingabout what then will rhetoric teach us

to persuade or advise the state




gorgias illustrates the nature of rhetoric by adducing the example of

themistocles who persuaded the athenians to build their docks and walls and

of pericles whom socrates himself has heard speaking about the middle wall of

the piraeus he adds that he has exercised a similar power over the patients of

his brother herodicus he could be chosen a physician by the assembly if he

pleased for no physician could compete with a rhetorician in popularity and

influence he could persuade the multitude of anything by the power of his

rhetoric not that the rhetorician ought to abuse this power any more than a

boxer should abuse the art of selfdefence rhetoric is a good thing but like

all good things may be unlawfully used neither is the teacher of the art to

be deemed unjust because his pupils are unjust and make a bad use of the

lessons which they have learned from him




socrates would like to know before he replies whether gorgias will quarrel

with him if he points out a slight inconsistency into which he has fallen or

whether he like himself is one who loves to be refuted gorgias declares that

he is quite one of his sort but fears that the argument may be tedious to the

company the company cheer and chaerephon and callicles exhort them to

proceed socrates gently points out the supposed inconsistency into which

gorgias appears to have fallen and which he is inclined to think may arise out

of a misapprehension of his own the rhetorician has been declared by gorgias

to be more persuasive to the ignorant than the physician or any other expert

and he is said to be ignorant and this ignorance of his is regarded by gorgias

as a happy condition for he has escaped the trouble of learning but is he as

ignorant of just and unjust as he is of medicine or building gorgias is

compelled to admit that if he did not know them previously he must learn them

from his teacher as a part of the art of rhetoric but he who has learned

carpentry is a carpenter and he who has learned music is a musician and he

who has learned justice is just the rhetorician then must be a just man and

rhetoric is a just thing but gorgias has already admitted the opposite of

this viz that rhetoric may be abused and that the rhetorician may act

unjustly how is the inconsistency to be explained




the fallacy of this argument is twofold for in the first place a man may know

justice and not be justhere is the old confusion of the arts and the

virtuesnor can any teacher be expected to counteract wholly the bent of

natural character and secondly a man may have a degree of justice but not

sufficient to prevent him from ever doing wrong polus is naturally exasperated

at the sophism which he is unable to detect of course he says the

rhetorician like every one else will admit that he knows justice how can he

do otherwise when pressed by the interrogations of socrates but he thinks

that great want of manners is shown in bringing the argument to such a pass

socrates ironically replies that when old men trip the young set them on

their legs again and he is quite willing to retract if he can be shown to be

in error but upon one condition which is that polus studies brevity polus is

in great indignation at not being allowed to use as many words as he pleases in

the free state of athens socrates retorts that yet harder will be his own

case if he is compelled to stay and listen to them after some altercation

they agree compare protag that polus shall ask and socrates answer




what is the art of rhetoric says polus not an art at all

replies socrates but a thing which in your book you affirm to have created

art polus asks what thing and socrates answers an experience

or routine of making a sort of delight or gratification but is not

rhetoric a fine thing i have not yet told you what rhetoric is will

you ask me another questionwhat is cookery what is

cookery an experience or routine of making a sort of delight or

gratification then they are the same or rather fall under the same class and

rhetoric has still to be distinguished from cookery what is

rhetoric asks polus once more a part of a not very creditable whole

which may be termed flattery is the reply but what part a

shadow of a part of politics this as might be expected is wholly

unintelligible both to gorgias and polus and in order to explain his meaning

to them socrates draws a distinction between shadows or appearances and

realities eg there is real health of body or soul and the appearance of

them real arts and sciences and the simulations of them now the soul and

body have two arts waiting upon them first the art of politics which attends

on the soul having a legislative part and a judicial part and another art

attending on the body which has no generic name but may also be described as

having two divisions one of which is medicine and the other gymnastic

corresponding with these four arts or sciences there are four shams or

simulations of them mere experiences as they may be termed because they give

no reason of their own existence the art of dressing up is the sham or

simulation of gymnastic the art of cookery of medicine rhetoric is the

simulation of justice and sophistic of legislation they may be summed up in

an arithmetical formula




tiring gymnastic cookery medicine sophistic legislation




and




cookery medicine rhetoric the art of justice




and this is the true scheme of them but when measured only by the

gratification which they procure they become jumbled together and return to

their aboriginal chaos socrates apologizes for the length of his speech which

was necessary to the explanation of the subject and begs polus not

unnecessarily to retaliate on him




do you mean to say that the rhetoricians are esteemed flatterers

they are not esteemed at all why have they not great power and can

they not do whatever they desire they have no power and they only do

what they think best and never what they desire for they never attain the

true object of desire which is the good as if you socrates would not

envy the possessor of despotic power who can imprison exile kill any one

whom he pleases but socrates replies that he has no wish to put any one

to death he who kills another even justly is not to be envied and he who

kills him unjustly is to be pitied it is better to suffer than to do

injustice he does not consider that going about with a dagger and putting men

out of the way or setting a house on fire is real power to this polus

assents on the ground that such acts would be punished but he is still of

opinion that evildoers if they are unpunished may be happy enough he

instances archelaus son of perdiccas the usurper of macedonia does not

socrates think him happysocrates would like to know more about him he

cannot pronounce even the great king to be happy unless he knows his mental

and moral condition polus explains that archelaus was a slave being the son

of a woman who was the slave of alcetas brother of perdiccas king of

macedonand he by every species of crime first murdering his uncle and

then his cousin and halfbrother obtained the kingdom this was very wicked

and yet all the world including socrates would like to have his place

socrates dismisses the appeal to numbers polus if he will may summon all the

rich men of athens nicias and his brothers aristocrates the house of

pericles or any other great familythis is the kind of evidence which is

adduced in courts of justice where truth depends upon numbers but socrates

employs proof of another sort his appeal is to one witness onlythat is

to say the person with whom he is speaking him he will convict out of his own

mouth and he is prepared to show after his manner that archelaus cannot be a

wicked man and yet happy




the evildoer is deemed happy if he escapes and miserable if he suffers

punishment but socrates thinks him less miserable if he suffers than if he

escapes polus is of opinion that such a paradox as this hardly deserves

refutation and is at any rate sufficiently refuted by the fact socrates has

only to compare the lot of the successful tyrant who is the envy of the world

and of the wretch who having been detected in a criminal attempt against the

state is crucified or burnt to death socrates replies that if they are both

criminal they are both miserable but that the unpunished is the more miserable

of the two at this polus laughs outright which leads socrates to remark that

laughter is a new species of refutation polus replies that he is already

refuted for if he will take the votes of the company he will find that no one

agrees with him to this socrates rejoins that he is not a public man and

referring to his own conduct at the trial of the generals after the battle of

arginusae is unable to take the suffrages of any company as he had shown on a

recent occasion he can only deal with one witness at a time and that is the

person with whom he is arguing but he is certain that in the opinion of any

man to do is worse than to suffer evil




polus though he will not admit this is ready to acknowledge that to do evil

is considered the more foul or dishonourable of the two but what is fair and

what is foul whether the terms are applied to bodies colours figures laws

habits studies must they not be defined with reference to pleasure and

utility polus assents to this latter doctrine and is easily persuaded that

the fouler of two things must exceed either in pain or in hurt but the doing

cannot exceed the suffering of evil in pain and therefore must exceed in hurt

thus doing is proved by the testimony of polus himself to be worse or more

hurtful than suffering




there remains the other question is a guilty man better off when he is

punished or when he is unpunished socrates replies that what is done justly

is suffered justly if the act is just the effect is just if to punish is

just to be punished is just and therefore fair and therefore beneficent and

the benefit is that the soul is improved there are three evils from which a

man may suffer and which affect him in estate body and soulthese

are poverty disease injustice and the foulest of these is injustice the

evil of the soul because that brings the greatest hurt and there are three

arts which heal these evilstrading medicine justiceand the

fairest of these is justice happy is he who has never committed injustice and

happy in the second degree he who has been healed by punishment and therefore

the criminal should himself go to the judge as he would to the physician and

purge away his crime rhetoric will enable him to display his guilt in proper

colours and to sustain himself and others in enduring the necessary penalty

and similarly if a man has an enemy he will desire not to punish him but that

he shall go unpunished and become worse and worse taking care only that he

does no injury to himself these are at least conceivable uses of the art and

no others have been discovered by us




here callicles who has been listening in silent amazement asks chaerephon

whether socrates is in earnest and on receiving the assurance that he is

proceeds to ask the same question of socrates himself for if such doctrines

are true life must have been turned upside down and all of us are doing the

opposite of what we ought to be doing




socrates replies in a style of playful irony that before men can understand

one another they must have some common feeling and such a community of feeling

exists between himself and callicles for both of them are lovers and they

have both a pair of loves the beloved of callicles are the athenian demos and

demos the son of pyrilampes the beloved of socrates are alcibiades and

philosophy the peculiarity of callicles is that he can never contradict his

loves he changes as his demos changes in all his opinions he watches the

countenance of both his loves and repeats their sentiments and if any one is

surprised at his sayings and doings the explanation of them is that he is not

a free agent but must always be imitating his two loves and this is the

explanation of socrates peculiarities also he is always repeating what

his mistress philosophy is saying to him who unlike his other love

alcibiades is ever the same ever true callicles must refute her or he will

never be at unity with himself and discord in life is far worse than the

discord of musical sounds




callicles answers that gorgias was overthrown because as polus said in

compliance with popular prejudice he had admitted that if his pupil did not

know justice the rhetorician must teach him and polus has been similarly

entangled because his modesty led him to admit that to suffer is more

honourable than to do injustice by custom yes but not by

nature says callicles and socrates is always playing between the two points

of view and putting one in the place of the other in this very argument what

polus only meant in a conventional sense has been affirmed by him to be a law

of nature for convention says that injustice is dishonourable

but nature says that might is right and we are always taming

down the nobler spirits among us to the conventional level but sometimes a

great man will rise up and reassert his original rights trampling under foot

all our formularies and then the light of natural justice shines forth pindar

says law the king of all does violence with high hand as is

indeed proved by the example of heracles who drove off the oxen of geryon and

never paid for them




this is the truth socrates as you will be convinced if you leave philosophy

and pass on to the real business of life a little philosophy is an excellent

thing too much is the ruin of a man he who has not passed his

metaphysics before he has grown up to manhood will never know the world

philosophers are ridiculous when they take to politics and i dare say that

politicians are equally ridiculous when they take to philosophy every

man as euripides says is fondest of that in which he is

best philosophy is graceful in youth like the lisp of infancy and

should be cultivated as a part of education but when a grownup man lisps or

studies philosophy i should like to beat him none of those overrefined

natures ever come to any good they avoid the busy haunts of men and skulk in

corners whispering to a few admiring youths and never giving utterance to any

noble sentiments




for you socrates i have a regard and therefore i say to you as zethus says

to amphion in the play that you have a noble soul disguised in a

puerile exterior and i would have you consider the danger which you and

other philosophers incur for you would not know how to defend yourself if any

one accused you in a lawcourtthere you would stand with gaping mouth

and dizzy brain and might be murdered robbed boxed on the ears with

impunity take my advice then and get a little common sense leave to others

these frivolities walk in the ways of the wealthy and be wise




socrates professes to have found in callicles the philosophers

touchstone and he is certain that any opinion in which they both agree must be

the very truth callicles has all the three qualities which are needed in a

criticknowledge goodwill frankness gorgias and polus although

learned men were too modest and their modesty made them contradict

themselves but callicles is welleducated and he is not too modest to speak

out of this he has already given proof and his goodwill is shown both by

his own profession and by his giving the same caution against philosophy to

socrates which socrates remembers hearing him give long ago to his own clique

of friends he will pledge himself to retract any error into which he may have

fallen and which callicles may point out but he would like to know first of

all what he and pindar mean by natural justice do they suppose that the rule

of justice is the rule of the stronger or of the better there is

no difference then are not the many superior to the one and the

opinions of the many better and their opinion is that justice is equality and

that to do is more dishonourable than to suffer wrong and as they are the

superior or stronger this opinion of theirs must be in accordance with natural

as well as conventional justice why will you continue splitting words

have i not told you that the superior is the better but what do you

mean by the better tell me that and please to be a little milder in your

language if you do not wish to drive me away i mean the worthier the

wiser you mean to say that one man of sense ought to rule over ten

thousand fools yes that is my meaning ought the physician then

to have a larger share of meats and drinks or the weaver to have more coats

or the cobbler larger shoes or the farmer more seed you are always

saying the same things socrates yes and on the same subjects too but

you are never saying the same things for first you defined the superior to

be the stronger and then the wiser and now something elsewhat do you

mean i mean men of political ability who ought to govern and to have

more than the governed than themselves what do you mean

i mean to say that every man is his own governor i see that you mean

those dolts the temperate but my doctrine is that a man should let his

desires grow and take the means of satisfying them to the many this is

impossible and therefore they combine to prevent him but if he is a king and

has power how base would he be in submitting to them to invite the common

herd to be lord over him when he might have the enjoyment of all things for

the truth is socrates that luxury and selfindulgence are virtue and

happiness all the rest is mere talk




socrates compliments callicles on his frankness in saying what other men only

think according to his view those who want nothing are not happy

why says callicles if they were stones and the dead

would be happy socrates in reply is led into a halfserious halfcomic

vein of reflection who knows as euripides says whether

life may not be death and death life nay there are philosophers who

maintain that even in life we are dead and that the body soma is the tomb

sema of the soul and some ingenious sicilian has made an allegory in which

he represents fools as the uninitiated who are supposed to be carrying water

to a vessel which is full of holes in a similarly holey sieve and this sieve

is their own soul the idea is fanciful but nevertheless is a figure of a

truth which i want to make you acknowledge viz that the life of contentment

is better than the life of indulgence are you disposed to admit that

far otherwise then hear another parable the life of

selfcontentment and selfindulgence may be represented respectively by two

men who are filling jars with streams of wine honey milkthe jars of

the one are sound and the jars of the other leaky the first fills his jars

and has no more trouble with them the second is always filling them and would

suffer extreme misery if he desisted are you of the same opinion still

yes socrates and the figure expresses what i mean for true pleasure

is a perpetual stream flowing in and flowing out to be hungry and always

eating to be thirsty and always drinking and to have all the other desires

and to satisfy them that as i admit is my idea of happiness and to

be itching and always scratching i do not deny that there may be

happiness even in that and to indulge unnatural desires if they are

abundantly satisfied callicles is indignant at the introduction of such

topics but he is reminded by socrates that they are introduced not by him

but by the maintainer of the identity of pleasure and good will callicles

still maintain this yes for the sake of consistency he will

the answer does not satisfy socrates who fears that he is losing his

touchstone a profession of seriousness on the part of callicles reassures him

and they proceed with the argument pleasure and good are the same but

knowledge and courage are not the same either with pleasure or good or with

one another socrates disproves the first of these statements by showing that

two opposites cannot coexist but must alternate with one anotherto be

well and ill together is impossible but pleasure and pain are simultaneous

and the cessation of them is simultaneous eg in the case of drinking and

thirsting whereas good and evil are not simultaneous and do not cease

simultaneously and therefore pleasure cannot be the same as good




callicles has already lost his temper and can only be persuaded to go on by

the interposition of gorgias socrates having already guarded against

objections by distinguishing courage and knowledge from pleasure and good

proceedsthe good are good by the presence of good and the bad are bad

by the presence of evil and the brave and wise are good and the cowardly and

foolish are bad and he who feels pleasure is good and he who feels pain is

bad and both feel pleasure and pain in nearly the same degree and sometimes

the bad man or coward in a greater degree therefore the bad man or coward is

as good as the brave or may be even better




callicles endeavours now to avert the inevitable absurdity by affirming that he

and all mankind admitted some pleasures to be good and others bad the good are

the beneficial and the bad are the hurtful and we should choose the one and

avoid the other but this as socrates observes is a return to the old

doctrine of himself and polus that all things should be done for the sake of

the good




callicles assents to this and socrates finding that they are agreed in

distinguishing pleasure from good returns to his old division of empirical

habits or shams or flatteries which study pleasure only and the arts which

are concerned with the higher interests of soul and body does callicles agree

to this division callicles will agree to anything in order that he may get

through the argument which of the arts then are flatteries fluteplaying

harpplaying choral exhibitions the dithyrambics of cinesias are all equally

condemned on the ground that they give pleasure only and meles the

harpplayer who was the father of cinesias failed even in that the stately

muse of tragedy is bent upon pleasure and not upon improvement poetry in

general is only a rhetorical address to a mixed audience of men women and

children and the orators are very far from speaking with a view to what is

best their way is to humour the assembly as if they were children




callicles replies that this is only true of some of them others have a real

regard for their fellowcitizens granted then there are two species of

oratory the one a flattery another which has a real regard for the citizens

but where are the orators among whom you find the latter callicles admits that

there are none remaining but there were such in the days when themistocles

cimon miltiades and the great pericles were still alive socrates replies

that none of these were true artists setting before themselves the duty of

bringing order out of disorder the good man and true orator has a settled

design running through his life to which he conforms all his words and

actions he desires to implant justice and eradicate injustice to implant all

virtue and eradicate all vice in the minds of his citizens he is the physician

who will not allow the sick man to indulge his appetites with a variety of

meats and drinks but insists on his exercising selfrestraint and this is

good for the soul and better than the unrestrained indulgence which callicles

was recently approving




here callicles who had been with difficulty brought to this point turns

restive and suggests that socrates shall answer his own questions

then says socrates one man must do for two and

though he had hoped to have given callicles an amphion in return

for his zethus he is willing to proceed at the same time he

hopes that callicles will correct him if he falls into error he recapitulates

the advantages which he has already won




the pleasant is not the same as the goodcallicles and i are agreed about

thatbut pleasure is to be pursued for the sake of the good and the

good is that of which the presence makes us good we and all things good have

acquired some virtue or other and virtue whether of body or soul of things

or persons is not attained by accident but is due to order and harmonious

arrangement and the soul which has order is better than the soul which is

without order and is therefore temperate and is therefore good and the

intemperate is bad and he who is temperate is also just and brave and pious

and has attained the perfection of goodness and therefore of happiness and the

intemperate whom you approve is the opposite of all this and is wretched he

therefore who would be happy must pursue temperance and avoid intemperance and

if possible escape the necessity of punishment but if he have done wrong he

must endure punishment in this way states and individuals should seek to

attain harmony which as the wise tell us is the bond of heaven and earth of

gods and men callicles has never discovered the power of geometrical

proportion in both worlds he would have men aim at disproportion and excess

but if he be wrong in this and if selfcontrol is the true secret of

happiness then the paradox is true that the only use of rhetoric is in

selfaccusation and polus was right in saying that to do wrong is worse than

to suffer wrong and gorgias was right in saying that the rhetorician must be a

just man and you were wrong in taunting me with my defenceless condition and

in saying that i might be accused or put to death or boxed on the ears with

impunity for i may repeat once more that to strike is worse than to be

strickento do than to suffer what i said then is now made fast in

adamantine bonds i myself know not the true nature of these things but i know

that no one can deny my words and not be ridiculous to do wrong is the

greatest of evils and to suffer wrong is the next greatest evil he who would

avoid the last must be a ruler or the friend of a ruler and to be the friend

he must be the equal of the ruler and must also resemble him under his

protection he will suffer no evil but will he also do no evil nay will he

not rather do all the evil which he can and escape and in this way the

greatest of all evils will befall him but this imitator of the

tyrant rejoins callicles will kill any one who does not

similarly imitate him socrates replies that he is not deaf and that he

has heard that repeated many times and can only reply that a bad man will

kill a good one yes and that is the provoking thing not

provoking to a man of sense who is not studying the arts which will preserve

him from danger and this as you say is the use of rhetoric in courts of

justice but how many other arts are there which also save men from death and

are yet quite humble in their pretensionssuch as the art of swimming or

the art of the pilot does not the pilot do men at least as much service as the

rhetorician and yet for the voyage from aegina to athens he does not charge

more than two obols and when he disembarks is quite unassuming in his

demeanour the reason is that he is not certain whether he has done his

passengers any good in saving them from death if one of them is diseased in

body and still more if he is diseased in mindwho can say the engineer

too will often save whole cities and yet you despise him and would not allow

your son to marry his daughter or his son to marry yours but what reason is

there in this for if virtue only means the saving of life whether your own or

anothers you have no right to despise him or any practiser of saving

arts but is not virtue something different from saving and being saved i

would have you rather consider whether you ought not to disregard length of

life and think only how you can live best leaving all besides to the will of

heaven for you must not expect to have influence either with the athenian

demos or with demos the son of pyrilampes unless you become like them what do

you say to this




there is some truth in what you are saying but i do not entirely

believe you




that is because you are in love with demos but let us have a little more

conversation you remember the two processesone which was directed to

pleasure the other which was directed to making men as good as possible and

those who have the care of the city should make the citizens as good as

possible but who would undertake a public building if he had never had a

teacher of the art of building and had never constructed a building before or

who would undertake the duty of statephysician if he had never cured either

himself or any one else should we not examine him before we entrusted him with

the office and as callicles is about to enter public life should we not

examine him whom has he made better for we have already admitted that this is

the statesmans proper business and we must ask the same question about

pericles and cimon and miltiades and themistocles whom did they make

better nay did not pericles make the citizens worse for he gave them pay

and at first he was very popular with them but at last they condemned him to

death yet surely he would be a bad tamer of animals who having received them

gentle taught them to kick and butt and man is an animal and pericles who

had the charge of man only made him wilder and more savage and unjust and

therefore he could not have been a good statesman the same tale might be

repeated about cimon themistocles miltiades but the charioteer who keeps his

seat at first is not thrown out when he gains greater experience and skill the

inference is that the statesman of a past age were no better than those of our

own they may have been cleverer constructors of docks and harbours but they

did not improve the character of the citizens i have told you again and again

and i purposely use the same images that the soul like the body may be

treated in two waysthere is the meaner and the higher art you seemed to

understand what i said at the time but when i ask you who were the really good

statesmen you answeras if i asked you who were the good trainers and

you answered thearion the baker mithoecus the author of the sicilian

cookerybook sarambus the vintner and you would be affronted if i told you

that these are a parcel of cooks who make men fat only to make them thin and

those whom they have fattened applaud them instead of finding fault with them

and lay the blame of their subsequent disorders on their physicians in this

respect callicles you are like them you applaud the statesmen of old who

pandered to the vices of the citizens and filled the city with docks and

harbours but neglected virtue and justice and when the fit of illness comes

the citizens who in like manner applauded themistocles pericles and others

will lay hold of you and my friend alcibiades and you will suffer for the

misdeeds of your predecessors the old story is always being

repeatedafter all his services the ungrateful city banished him

or condemned him to death as if the statesman should not have taught

the city better he surely cannot blame the state for having unjustly used him

any more than the sophist or teacher can find fault with his pupils if they

cheat him and the sophist and orator are in the same case although you admire

rhetoric and despise sophistic whereas sophistic is really the higher of the

two the teacher of the arts takes money but the teacher of virtue or politics

takes no money because this is the only kind of service which makes the

disciple desirous of requiting his teacher




socrates concludes by finally asking to which of the two modes of serving the

state callicles invites himto the inferior and ministerial

one is the ingenuous reply that is the only way of avoiding death

replies socrates and he has heard often enough and would rather not hear

again that the bad man will kill the good but he thinks that such a fate is

very likely reserved for him because he remarks that he is the only person who

teaches the true art of politics and very probably as in the case which he

described to polus he may be the physician who is tried by a jury of children

he cannot say that he has procured the citizens any pleasure and if any one

charges him with perplexing them or with reviling their elders he will not be

able to make them understand that he has only been actuated by a desire for

their good and therefore there is no saying what his fate may be and

do you think that a man who is unable to help himself is in a good

condition yes callicles if he have the true selfhelp which is never

to have said or done any wrong to himself or others if i had not this kind of

selfhelp i should be ashamed but if i die for want of your flattering

rhetoric i shall die in peace for death is no evil but to go to the world

below laden with offences is the worst of evils in proof of which i will tell

you a tale




under the rule of cronos men were judged on the day of their death and when

judgment had been given upon them they departedthe good to the islands

of the blest the bad to the house of vengeance but as they were still living

and had their clothes on at the time when they were being judged there was

favouritism and zeus when he came to the throne was obliged to alter the

mode of procedure and try them after death having first sent down prometheus

to take away from them the foreknowledge of death minos rhadamanthus and

aeacus were appointed to be the judges rhadamanthus for asia aeacus for

europe and minos was to hold the court of appeal now death is the separation

of soul and body but after death soul and body alike retain their

characteristics the fat man the dandy the branded slave are all

distinguishable some prince or potentate perhaps even the great king himself

appears before rhadamanthus and he instantly detects him though he knows not

who he is he sees the scars of perjury and iniquity and sends him away to the

house of torment




for there are two classes of souls who undergo punishmentthe curable and

the incurable the curable are those who are benefited by their punishment the

incurable are such as archelaus who benefit others by becoming a warning to

them the latter class are generally kings and potentates meaner persons

happily for themselves have not the same power of doing injustice sisyphus

and tityus not thersites are supposed by homer to be undergoing everlasting

punishment not that there is anything to prevent a great man from being a good

one as is shown by the famous example of aristeides the son of lysimachus

but to rhadamanthus the souls are only known as good or bad they are stripped

of their dignities and preferments he despatches the bad to tartarus labelled

either as curable or incurable and looks with love and admiration on the soul

of some just one whom he sends to the islands of the blest similar is the

practice of aeacus and minos overlooks them holding a golden sceptre as

odysseus in homer saw him




wielding a sceptre of gold and giving laws to the dead




my wish for myself and my fellowmen is that we may present our souls

undefiled to the judge in that day my desire in life is to be able to meet

death and i exhort you and retort upon you the reproach which you cast upon

methat you will stand before the judge gaping and with dizzy brain

and any one may box you on the ear and do you all manner of evil




perhaps you think that this is an old wives fable but you who are the

three wisest men in hellas have nothing better to say and no one will ever

show that to do is better than to suffer evil a man should study to be and

not merely to seem if he is bad he should become good and avoid all

flattery whether of the many or of the few




follow me then and if you are looked down upon that will do you no harm and

when we have practised virtue we will betake ourselves to politics but not

until we are delivered from the shameful state of ignorance and uncertainty in

which we are at present let us follow in the way of virtue and justice and

not in the way to which you callicles invite us for that way is nothing

worth




we will now consider in order some of the principal points of the dialogue

having regard  to the age of plato and the ironical character of his

writings we may compare him with himself and with other great teachers and

we may note in passing the objections of his critics and then  casting one

eye upon him we may cast another upon ourselves and endeavour to draw out the

great lessons which he teaches for all time stripped of the accidental form in

which they are enveloped




 in the gorgias as in nearly all the other dialogues of plato we are made

aware that formal logic has as yet no existence the old difficulty of framing

a definition recurs the illusive analogy of the arts and the virtues also

continues the ambiguity of several words such as nature custom the

honourable the good is not cleared up the sophists are still floundering

about the distinction of the real and seeming figures of speech are made the

basis of arguments the possibility of conceiving a universal art or science

which admits of application to a particular subjectmatter is a difficulty

which remains unsolved and has not altogether ceased to haunt the world at the

present day compare charmides the defect of clearness is also apparent in

socrates himself unless we suppose him to be practising on the simplicity of

his opponent or rather perhaps trying an experiment in dialectics nothing can

be more fallacious than the contradiction which he pretends to have discovered

in the answers of gorgias see above the advantages which he gains over polus

are also due to a false antithesis of pleasure and good and to an erroneous

assertion that an agent and a patient may be described by similar

predicatesa mistake which aristotle partly shares and partly corrects

in the nicomachean ethics traces of a robust sophistry are

likewise discernible in his argument with callicles




 although socrates professes to be convinced by reason only yet the

argument is often a sort of dialectical fiction by which he conducts himself

and others to his own ideal of life and action and we may sometimes wish that

we could have suggested answers to his antagonists or pointed out to them the

rocks which lay concealed under the ambiguous terms good pleasure and the

like but it would be as useless to examine his arguments by the requirements

of modern logic as to criticise this ideal from a merely utilitarian point of

view if we say that the ideal is generally regarded as unattainable and that

mankind will by no means agree in thinking that the criminal is happier when

punished than when unpunished any more than they would agree to the stoical

paradox that a man may be happy on the rack plato has already admitted that

the world is against him neither does he mean to say that archelaus is

tormented by the stings of conscience or that the sensations of the impaled

criminal are more agreeable than those of the tyrant drowned in luxurious

enjoyment neither is he speaking as in the protagoras of virtue as a

calculation of pleasure an opinion which he afterwards repudiates in the

phaedo what then is his meaning his meaning we shall be able to illustrate

best by parallel notions which whether justifiable by logic or not have

always existed among mankind we must remind the reader that socrates himself

implies that he will be understood or appreciated by very few




he is speaking not of the consciousness of happiness but of the idea of

happiness when a martyr dies in a good cause when a soldier falls in battle

we do not suppose that death or wounds are without pain or that their physical

suffering is always compensated by a mental satisfaction still we regard them

as happy and we would a thousand times rather have their death than a shameful

life nor is this only because we believe that they will obtain an immortality

of fame or that they will have crowns of glory in another world when their

enemies and persecutors will be proportionably tormented men are found in a

few instances to do what is right without reference to public opinion or to

consequences and we regard them as happy on this ground only much as

socrates friends in the opening of the phaedo are described as regarding

him or as was said of another they looked upon his face as upon the

face of an angel we are not concerned to justify this idealism by the

standard of utility or public opinion but merely to point out the existence of

such a sentiment in the better part of human nature




the idealism of plato is founded upon this sentiment he would maintain that in

some sense or other truth and right are alone to be sought and that all other

goods are only desirable as means towards these he is thought to have erred in

considering the agent only and making no reference to the happiness of

others as affected by him but the happiness of others or of mankind

if regarded as an end is really quite as ideal and almost as paradoxical to

the common understanding as platos conception of happiness for the

greatest happiness of the greatest number may mean also the greatest pain of

the individual which will procure the greatest pleasure of the greatest number

ideas of utility like those of duty and right may be pushed to unpleasant

consequences nor can plato in the gorgias be deemed purely selfregarding

considering that socrates expressly mentions the duty of imparting the truth

when discovered to others nor must we forget that the side of ethics which

regards others is by the ancients merged in politics both in plato and

aristotle as well as in the stoics the social principle though taking

another form is really far more prominent than in most modern treatises on

ethics




the idealizing of suffering is one of the conceptions which have exercised the

greatest influence on mankind into the theological import of this or into the

consideration of the errors to which the idea may have given rise we need not

now enter all will agree that the ideal of the divine sufferer whose words

the world would not receive the man of sorrows of whom the hebrew prophets

spoke has sunk deep into the heart of the human race it is a similar picture

of suffering goodness which plato desires to pourtray not without an allusion

to the fate of his master socrates he is convinced that somehow or other

such an one must be happy in life or after death in the republic he

endeavours to show that his happiness would be assured here in a wellordered

state but in the actual condition of human things the wise and good are weak

and miserable such an one is like a man fallen among wild beasts exposed to

every sort of wrong and obloquy




plato like other philosophers is thus led on to the conclusion that if

the ways of god to man are to be justified the

hopes of another life must be included if the question could have been put to

him whether a man dying in torments was happy still even if as he suggests

in the apology death be only a long sleep we can hardly tell

what would have been his answer there have been a few who quite

independently of rewards and punishments or of posthumous reputation or any

other influence of public opinion have been willing to sacrifice their lives

for the good of others it is difficult to say how far in such cases an

unconscious hope of a future life or a general faith in the victory of good in

the world may have supported the sufferers but this extreme idealism is not

in accordance with the spirit of plato he supposes a day of retribution in

which the good are to be rewarded and the wicked punished though as he says

in the phaedo no man of sense will maintain that the details of the stories

about another world are true he will insist that something of the kind is

true and will frame his life with a view to this unknown future even in the

republic he introduces a future life as an afterthought when the superior

happiness of the just has been established on what is thought to be an

immutable foundation at the same time he makes a point of determining his main

thesis independently of remoter consequences




 platos theory of punishment is partly vindictive partly corrective

in the gorgias as well as in the phaedo and republic a few great criminals

chiefly tyrants are reserved as examples but most men have never had the

opportunity of attaining this preeminence of evil they are not incurable and

their punishment is intended for their improvement they are to suffer because

they have sinned like sick men they must go to the physician and be healed

on this representation of platos the criticism has been made that the

analogy of disease and injustice is partial only and that suffering instead

of improving men may have just the opposite effect




like the general analogy of the arts and the virtues the analogy of disease

and injustice or of medicine and justice is certainly imperfect but ideas

must be given through something the nature of the mind which is unseen can

only be represented under figures derived from visible objects if these

figures are suggestive of some new aspect under which the mind may be

considered we cannot find fault with them for not exactly coinciding with the

ideas represented they partake of the imperfect nature of language and must

not be construed in too strict a manner that plato sometimes reasons from them

as if they were not figures but realities is due to the defective logical

analysis of his age




nor does he distinguish between the suffering which improves and the suffering

which only punishes and deters he applies to the sphere of ethics a conception

of punishment which is really derived from criminal law he does not see that

such punishment is only negative and supplies no principle of moral growth or

development he is not far off the higher notion of an education of man to be

begun in this world and to be continued in other stages of existence which is

further developed in the republic and christian thinkers who have ventured

out of the beaten track in their meditations on the last things

have found a ray of light in his writings but he has not explained how or in

what way punishment is to contribute to the improvement of mankind he has not

followed out the principle which he affirms in the republic that god is

the author of evil only with a view to good and that they were

the better for being punished still his doctrine of a future state of

rewards and punishments may be compared favourably with that perversion of

christian doctrine which makes the everlasting punishment of human beings

depend on a brief moment of time or even on the accident of an accident and

he has escaped the difficulty which has often beset divines respecting the

future destiny of the meaner sort of men thersites and the like who are

neither very good nor very bad by not counting them worthy of eternal

damnation




we do plato violence in pressing his figures of speech or chains of argument

and not less so in asking questions which were beyond the horizon of his

vision or did not come within the scope of his design the main purpose of the

gorgias is not to answer questions about a future world but to place in

antagonism the true and false life and to contrast the judgments and opinions

of men with judgment according to the truth plato may be accused of

representing a superhuman or transcendental virtue in the description of the

just man in the gorgias or in the companion portrait of the philosopher in the

theaetetus and at the same time may be thought to be condemning a state of the

world which always has existed and always will exist among men but such ideals

act powerfully on the imagination of mankind and such condemnations are not

mere paradoxes of philosophers but the natural rebellion of the higher sense

of right in man against the ordinary conditions of human life the greatest

statesmen have fallen very far short of the political ideal and are therefore

justly involved in the general condemnation




subordinate to the main purpose of the dialogue are some other questions which

may be briefly considered




a the antithesis of good and pleasure which as in other dialogues is supposed

to consist in the permanent nature of the one compared with the transient and

relative nature of the other good and pleasure knowledge and sense truth and

opinion essence and generation virtue and pleasure the real and the

apparent the infinite and finite harmony or beauty and discord dialectic and

rhetoric or poetry are so many pairs of opposites which in plato easily pass

into one another and are seldom kept perfectly distinct and we must not

forget that platos conception of pleasure is the heracleitean flux

transferred to the sphere of human conduct there is some degree of unfairness

in opposing the principle of good which is objective to the principle of

pleasure which is subjective for the assertion of the permanence of good is

only based on the assumption of its objective character had plato fixed his

mind not on the ideal nature of good but on the subjective consciousness of

happiness that would have been found to be as transient and precarious as

pleasure




b the arts or sciences when pursued without any view to truth or the

improvement of human life are called flatteries they are all alike dependent

upon the opinion of mankind from which they are derived to plato the whole

world appears to be sunk in error based on selfinterest to this is opposed

the one wise man hardly professing to have found truth yet strong in the

conviction that a virtuous life is the only good whether regarded with

reference to this world or to another statesmen sophists rhetoricians

poets are alike brought up for judgment they are the parodies of wise men

and their arts are the parodies of true arts and sciences all that they call

science is merely the result of that study of the tempers of the great beast

which he describes in the republic




c various other points of contact naturally suggest themselves between the

gorgias and other dialogues especially the republic the philebus and the

protagoras there are closer resemblances both of spirit and language in the

republic than in any other dialogue the verbal similarity tending to show that

they were written at the same period of platos life for the republic

supplies that education and training of which the gorgias suggests the

necessity the theory of the many weak combining against the few strong in the

formation of society which is indeed a partial truth is similar in both of

them and is expressed in nearly the same language the sufferings and fate of

the just man the powerlessness of evil and the reversal of the situation in

another life are also points of similarity the poets like the rhetoricians

are condemned because they aim at pleasure only as in the republic they are

expelled by the state because they are imitators and minister to the weaker

side of human nature that poetry is akin to rhetoric may be compared with the

analogous notion which occurs in the protagoras that the ancient poets were

the sophists of their day in some other respects the protagoras rather offers

a contrast than a parallel the character of protagoras may be compared with

that of gorgias but the conception of happiness is different in the two

dialogues being described in the former according to the old socratic notion

as deferred or accumulated pleasure while in the gorgias and in the phaedo

pleasure and good are distinctly opposed




this opposition is carried out from a speculative point of view in the

philebus there neither pleasure nor wisdom are allowed to be the chief good

but pleasure and good are not so completely opposed as in the gorgias for

innocent pleasures and such as have no antecedent pains are allowed to rank

in the class of goods the allusion to gorgias definition of rhetoric

philebus compare gorg as the art of persuasion of all arts the best for

to it all things submit not by compulsion but of their own free

willmarks a close and perhaps designed connection between the two

dialogues in both the ideas of measure order harmony are the connecting

links between the beautiful and the good




in general spirit and character that is in irony and antagonism to public

opinion the gorgias most nearly resembles the apology crito and portions of

the republic and like the philebus though from another point of view may be

thought to stand in the same relation to platos theory of morals which

the theaetetus bears to his theory of knowledge




d a few minor points still remain to be summed up  the extravagant irony

in the reason which is assigned for the pilots modest charge and in the

proposed use of rhetoric as an instrument of selfcondemnation and in the

mighty power of geometrical equality in both worlds  the reference of the

mythus to the previous discussion should not be overlooked the fate reserved

for incurable criminals such as archelaus the retaliation of the box on the

ears the nakedness of the souls and of the judges who are stript of the

clothes or disguises which rhetoric and public opinion have hitherto provided

for them compare swifts notion that the universe is a suit of clothes

tale of a tub the fiction seems to have involved plato in the necessity of

supposing that the soul retained a sort of corporeal likeness after death 

the appeal of the authority of homer who says that odysseus saw minos in his

court holding a golden sceptre which gives verisimilitude to the

tale




it is scarcely necessary to repeat that plato is playing both sides of

the game and that in criticising the characters of gorgias and polus

we are not passing any judgment on historical individuals but only attempting

to analyze the dramatis personae as they were conceived by him

neither is it necessary to enlarge upon the obvious fact that plato is a

dramatic writer whose real opinions cannot always be assumed to be those which

he puts into the mouth of socrates or any other speaker who appears to have

the best of the argument or to repeat the observation that he is a poet as

well as a philosopher or to remark that he is not to be tried by a modern

standard but interpreted with reference to his place in the history of thought

and the opinion of his time




it has been said that the most characteristic feature of the gorgias is the

assertion of the right of dissent or private judgment but this mode of

stating the question is really opposed both to the spirit of plato and of

ancient philosophy generally for plato is not asserting any abstract right or

duty of toleration or advantage to be derived from freedom of thought indeed

in some other parts of his writings eg laws he has fairly laid himself

open to the charge of intolerance no speculations had as yet arisen respecting

the liberty of prophesying and plato is not affirming any

abstract right of this nature but he is asserting the duty and right of the

one wise and true man to dissent from the folly and falsehood of the many at

the same time he acknowledges the natural result which he hardly seeks to

avert that he who speaks the truth to a multitude regardless of consequences

will probably share the fate of socrates





the irony of plato sometimes veils from us the height of idealism to which he

soars when declaring truths which the many will not receive he puts on an

armour which cannot be pierced by them the weapons of ridicule are taken out

of their hands and the laugh is turned against themselves the disguises which

socrates assumes are like the parables of the new testament or the oracles of

the delphian god they half conceal half reveal his meaning the more he is

in earnest the more ironical he becomes and he is never more in earnest or

more ironical than in the gorgias he hardly troubles himself to answer

seriously the objections of gorgias and polus and therefore he sometimes

appears to be careless of the ordinary requirements of logic yet in the

highest sense he is always logical and consistent with himself the form of the

argument may be paradoxical the substance is an appeal to the higher reason

he is uttering truths before they can be understood as in all ages the words

of philosophers when they are first uttered have found the world unprepared

for them a further misunderstanding arises out of the wildness of his humour

he is supposed not only by callicles but by the rest of mankind to be jesting

when he is profoundly serious at length he makes even polus in earnest

finally he drops the argument and heedless any longer of the forms of

dialectic he loses himself in a sort of triumph while at the same time he

retaliates upon his adversaries from this confusion of jest and earnest we

may now return to the ideal truth and draw out in a simple form the main

theses of the dialogue




first thesis




it is a greater evil to do than to suffer injustice




compare the new testament




it is better to suffer for well doing than for evil

doing pet




and the sermon on the mount




blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness

sakematt




the words of socrates are more abstract than the words of christ but they

equally imply that the only real evil is moral evil the righteous may suffer

or die but they have their reward and even if they had no reward would be

happier than the wicked the world represented by polus is ready when they

are asked to acknowledge that injustice is dishonourable and for their own

sakes men are willing to punish the offender compare republic but they are

not equally willing to acknowledge that injustice even if successful is

essentially evil and has the nature of disease and death especially when

crimes are committed on the great scalethe crimes of tyrants ancient or

modernafter a while seeing that they cannot be undone and have become

a part of history mankind are disposed to forgive them not from any

magnanimity or charity but because their feelings are blunted by time and

to forgive is convenient to them the tangle of good and evil can

no longer be unravelled and although they know that the end cannot justify the

means they feel also that good has often come out of evil but socrates would

have us pass the same judgment on the tyrant now and always though he is

surrounded by his satellites and has the applauses of europe and asia ringing

in his ears though he is the civilizer or liberator of half a continent he

is and always will be the most miserable of men the greatest consequences

for good or for evil cannot alter a hairs breadth the morality of

actions which are right or wrong in themselves this is the standard which

socrates holds up to us because politics and perhaps human life generally

are of a mixed nature we must not allow our principles to sink to the level of

our practice




and so of private individualsto them too the world occasionally speaks

of the consequences of their actionsif they are lovers of pleasure

they will ruin their health if they are false or dishonest they will lose

their character but socrates would speak to them not of what will be but of

what isof the present consequence of lowering and degrading the soul

and all higher natures or perhaps all men everywhere if they were not tempted

by interest or passion would agree with himthey would rather be the

victims than the perpetrators of an act of treachery or of tyranny reason

tells them that death comes sooner or later to all and is not so great an evil

as an unworthy life or rather if rightly regarded not an evil at all but to

a good man the greatest good for in all of us there are slumbering ideals of

truth and right which may at any time awaken and develop a new life in us




second thesis




it is better to suffer for wrong doing than not to suffer




there might have been a condition of human life in which the penalty followed

at once and was proportioned to the offence moral evil would then be scarcely

distinguishable from physical mankind would avoid vice as they avoid pain or

death but nature with a view of deepening and enlarging our characters has

for the most part hidden from us the consequences of our actions and we can

only foresee them by an effort of reflection to awaken in us this habit of

reflection is the business of early education which is continued in maturer

years by observation and experience the spoilt child is in later life said to

be unfortunatehe had better have suffered when he was young and been

saved from suffering afterwards but is not the sovereign equally unfortunate

whose education and manner of life are always concealing from him the

consequences of his own actions until at length they are revealed to him in

some terrible downfall which may perhaps have been caused not by his own

fault another illustration is afforded by the pauper and criminal classes who

scarcely reflect at all except on the means by which they can compass their

immediate ends we pity them and make allowances for them but we do not

consider that the same principle applies to human actions generally not to

have been found out in some dishonesty or folly regarded from a moral or

religious point of view is the greatest of misfortunes the success of our

evil doings is a proof that the gods have ceased to strive with us and have

given us over to ourselves there is nothing to remind us of our sins and

therefore nothing to correct them like our sorrows they are healed by time




while rank corruption mining all within

infects unseen




the accustomed irony of socrates adds a corollary to the

argumentwould you punish your enemy you should allow him to

escape unpunishedthis is the true retaliation compare the

obscure verse of proverbs therefore if thine enemy hunger feed

him etc quoted in romans




men are not in the habit of dwelling upon the dark side of their own lives

they do not easily see themselves as others see them they are very kind and

very blind to their own faults the rhetoric of selflove is always pleading

with them on their own behalf adopting a similar figure of speech socrates

would have them use rhetoric not in defence but in accusation of themselves

as they are guided by feeling rather than by reason to their feelings the

appeal must be made they must speak to themselves they must argue with

themselves they must paint in eloquent words the character of their own evil

deeds to any suffering which they have deserved they must persuade themselves

to submit under the figure there lurks a real thought which expressed in

another form admits of an easy application to ourselves for do not we too

accuse as well as excuse ourselves and we call to our aid the rhetoric of

prayer and preaching which the mind silently employs while the struggle

between the better and the worse is going on within us and sometimes we are

too hard upon ourselves because we want to restore the balance which selflove

has overthrown or disturbed and then again we may hear a voice as of a parent

consoling us in religious diaries a sort of drama is often enacted by the

consciences of men accusing or else excusing them for all our

life long we are talking with ourselveswhat is thought but speech what

is feeling but rhetoric and if rhetoric is used on one side only we shall be

always in danger of being deceived and so the words of socrates which at

first sounded paradoxical come home to the experience of all of us




third thesis




we do not what we will but what we wish




socrates would teach us a lesson which we are slow to learnthat good

intentions and even benevolent actions when they are not prompted by wisdom

are of no value we believe something to be for our good which we afterwards

find out not to be for our good the consequences may be inevitable for they

may follow an invariable law yet they may often be the very opposite of what

is expected by us when we increase pauperism by almsgiving when we tie up

property without regard to changes of circumstances when we say hastily what

we deliberately disapprove when we do in a moment of passion what upon

reflection we regret when from any want of selfcontrol we give another an

advantage over uswe are doing not what we will but what we wish all

actions of which the consequences are not weighed and foreseen are of this

impotent and paralytic sort and the author of them has the least

possible power while seeming to have the greatest for he is actually

bringing about the reverse of what he intended and yet the book of nature is

open to him in which he who runs may read if he will exercise ordinary

attention every day offers him experiences of his own and of other mens

characters and he passes them unheeded by the contemplation of the

consequences of actions and the ignorance of men in regard to them seems to

have led socrates to his famous thesisvirtue is

knowledge which is not so much an error or paradox as a half truth

seen first in the twilight of ethical philosophy but also the half of the

truth which is especially needed in the present age for as the world has grown

older men have been too apt to imagine a right and wrong apart from

consequences while a few on the other hand have sought to resolve them

wholly into their consequences but socrates or plato for him neither divides

nor identifies them though the time has not yet arrived either for utilitarian

or transcendental systems of moral philosophy he recognizes the two elements

which seem to lie at the basis of morality compare the following now

and for us it is a time to hellenize and to praise knowing for we have

hebraized too much and have overvalued doing but the habits and discipline

received from hebraism remain for our race an eternal possession and as

humanity is constituted one must never assign the second rank today without

being ready to restore them to the first tomorrow sir william w

hunter preface to orissa




fourth thesis




to be and not to seem is the end of life




the greek in the age of plato admitted praise to be one of the chief incentives

to moral virtue and to most men the opinion of their fellows is a leading

principle of action hence a certain element of seeming enters into all things

all or almost all desire to appear better than they are that they may win the

esteem or admiration of others a man of ability can easily feign the language

of piety or virtue and there is an unconscious as well as a conscious

hypocrisy which according to socrates is the worst of the two again there

is the sophistry of classes and professions there are the different opinions

about themselves and one another which prevail in different ranks of society

there is the bias given to the mind by the study of one department of human

knowledge to the exclusion of the rest and stronger far the prejudice

engendered by a pecuniary or party interest in certain tenets there is the

sophistry of law the sophistry of medicine the sophistry of politics the

sophistry of theology all of these disguises wear the appearance of the truth

some of them are very ancient and we do not easily disengage ourselves from

them for we have inherited them and they have become a part of us the

sophistry of an ancient greek sophist is nothing compared with the sophistry of

a religious order or of a church in which during many ages falsehood has been

accumulating and everything has been said on one side and nothing on the

other the conventions and customs which we observe in conversation and the

opposition of our interests when we have dealings with one another the

buyer saith it is noughtit is nought etc are always

obscuring our sense of truth and right the sophistry of human nature is far

more subtle than the deceit of any one man few persons speak freely from their

own natures and scarcely any one dares to think for himself most of us

imperceptibly fall into the opinions of those around us which we partly help

to make a man who would shake himself loose from them requires great force of

mind he hardly knows where to begin in the search after truth on every side

he is met by the world which is not an abstraction of theologians but the

most real of all things being another name for ourselves when regarded

collectively and subjected to the influences of society




then comes socrates impressed as no other man ever was with the unreality and

untruthfulness of popular opinion and tells mankind that they must be and not

seem how are they to be at any rate they must have the spirit and desire to

be if they are ignorant they must acknowledge their ignorance to themselves

if they are conscious of doing evil they must learn to do well if they are

weak and have nothing in them which they can call themselves they must

acquire firmness and consistency if they are indifferent they must begin to

take an interest in the great questions which surround them they must try to

be what they would fain appear in the eyes of their fellowmen a single

individual cannot easily change public opinion but he can be true and

innocent simple and independent he can know what he does and what he does

not know and though not without an effort he can form a judgment of his own

at least in common matters in his most secret actions he can show the same

high principle compare republic which he shows when supported and watched by

public opinion and on some fitting occasion on some question of humanity or

truth or right even an ordinary man from the natural rectitude of his

disposition may be found to take up arms against a whole tribe of politicians

and lawyers and be too much for them




who is the true and who the false statesman




the true statesman is he who brings order out of disorder who first organizes

and then administers the government of his own country and having made a

nation seeks to reconcile the national interests with those of europe and of

mankind he is not a mere theorist nor yet a dealer in expedients the whole

and the parts grow together in his mind while the head is conceiving the hand

is executing although obliged to descend to the world he is not of the world

his thoughts are fixed not on power or riches or extension of territory but on

an ideal state in which all the citizens have an equal chance of health and

life and the highest education is within the reach of all and the moral and

intellectual qualities of every individual are freely developed and the

idea of good is the animating principle of the whole not the attainment

of freedom alone or of order alone but how to unite freedom with order is the

problem which he has to solve




the statesman who places before himself these lofty aims has undertaken a task

which will call forth all his powers he must control himself before he can

control others he must know mankind before he can manage them he has no

private likes or dislikes he does not conceal personal enmity under the

disguise of moral or political principle such meannesses into which men too

often fall unintentionally are absorbed in the consciousness of his mission

and in his love for his country and for mankind he will sometimes ask himself

what the next generation will say of him not because he is careful of

posthumous fame but because he knows that the result of his life as a whole

will then be more fairly judged he will take time for the execution of his

plans not hurrying them on when the mind of a nation is unprepared for them

but like the ruler of the universe himself working in the appointed time for

he knows that human life if not long in comparison with eternity

republic is sufficient for the fulfilment of many great purposes he knows

too that the work will be still going on when he is no longer here and he

will sometimes especially when his powers are failing think of that other

city of which the pattern is in heaven republic




the false politician is the servingman of the state in order to govern men he

becomes like them their minds are married in conjunction they

bear themselves like vulgar and tyrannical masters and he is

their obedient servant the true politician if he would rule men must make

them like himself he must educate his party until they cease to

be a party he must breathe into them the spirit which will hereafter give form

to their institutions politics with him are not a mechanism for seeming what

he is not or for carrying out the will of the majority himself a

representative man he is the representative not of the lower but of the higher

elements of the nation there is a better as well as a worse public opinion

of which he seeks to lay hold as there is also a deeper current of human

affairs in which he is borne up when the waves nearer the shore are threatening

him he acknowledges that he cannot take the world by forcetwo or three

moves on the political chess board are all that he can fore seetwo or

three weeks moves on the political chessboard are all that he can

foreseetwo or three weeks or months are granted to him in which he can

provide against a coming struggle but he knows also that there are permanent

principles of politics which are always tending to the wellbeing of

statesbetter administration better education the reconciliation of

conflicting elements increased security against external enemies these are

not of today or yesterday but are the same in all times and

under all forms of government then when the storm descends and the winds blow

though he knows not beforehand the hour of danger the pilot not like

platos captain in the republic halfblind and deaf but with

penetrating eye and quick ear is ready to take command of the ship and guide

her into port




the false politician asks not what is true but what is the opinion of the

worldnot what is right but what is expedient the only measures of

which he approves are the measures which will pass he has no intention of

fighting an uphill battle he keeps the roadway of politics he is unwilling to

incur the persecution and enmity which political convictions would entail upon

him he begins with popularity and in fair weather sails gallantly along but

unpopularity soon follows him for men expect their leaders to be better and

wiser than themselves to be their guides in danger their saviours in

extremity they do not really desire them to obey all the ignorant impulses of

the popular mind and if they fail them in a crisis they are disappointed

then as socrates says the cry of ingratitude is heard which is most

unreasonable for the people who have been taught no better have done what

might be expected of them and their statesmen have received justice at their

hands




the true statesman is aware that he must adapt himself to times and

circumstances he must have allies if he is to fight against the world he must

enlighten public opinion he must accustom his followers to act together

although he is not the mere executor of the will of the majority he must win

over the majority to himself he is their leader and not their follower but in

order to lead he must also follow he will neither exaggerate nor undervalue

the power of a statesman neither adopting the laissez faire nor

the paternal government principle but he will whether he is

dealing with children in politics or with fullgrown men seek to do for the

people what the government can do for them and what from imperfect education

or deficient powers of combination they cannot do for themselves he knows

that if he does too much for them they will do nothing and that if he does

nothing for them they will in some states of society be utterly helpless for

the many cannot exist without the few if the material force of a country is

from below wisdom and experience are from above it is not a small part of

human evils which kings and governments make or cure the statesman is well

aware that a great purpose carried out consistently during many years will at

last be executed he is playing for a stake which may be partly determined by

some accident and therefore he will allow largely for the unknown element of

politics but the game being one in which chance and skill are combined if he

plays long enough he is certain of victory he will not be always consistent

for the world is changing and though he depends upon the support of a party

he will remember that he is the minister of the whole he lives not for the

present but for the future and he is not at all sure that he will be

appreciated either now or then for he may have the existing order of society

against him and may not be remembered by a distant posterity




there are always discontented idealists in politics who like socrates in the

gorgias find fault with all statesmen past as well as present not excepting

the greatest names of history mankind have an uneasy feeling that they ought

to be better governed than they are just as the actual philosopher falls short

of the one wise man so does the actual statesman fall short of the ideal and

so partly from vanity and egotism but partly also from a true sense of the

faults of eminent men a temper of dissatisfaction and criticism springs up

among those who are ready enough to acknowledge the inferiority of their own

powers no matter whether a statesman makes high professions or none at

allthey are reduced sooner or later to the same level and sometimes the

more unscrupulous man is better esteemed than the more conscientious because

he has not equally deceived expectations such sentiments may be unjust but

they are widely spread we constantly find them recurring in reviews and

newspapers and still oftener in private conversation




we may further observe that the art of government while in some respects

tending to improve has in others a tendency to degenerate as institutions

become more popular governing for the people cannot easily be combined with

governing by the people the interests of classes are too strong for the ideas

of the statesman who takes a comprehensive view of the whole according to

socrates the true governor will find ruin or death staring him in the face and

will only be induced to govern from the fear of being governed by a worse man

than himself republic and in modern times though the world has grown

milder and the terrible consequences which plato foretells no longer await an

english statesman any one who is not actuated by a blind ambition will only

undertake from a sense of duty a work in which he is most likely to fail and

even if he succeed will rarely be rewarded by the gratitude of his own

generation




socrates who is not a politician at all tells us that he is the only real

politician of his time let us illustrate the meaning of his words by applying

them to the history of our own country he would have said that not pitt or

fox or canning or sir r peel are the real politicians of their time but

locke hume adam smith bentham ricardo these during the greater part of

their lives occupied an inconsiderable space in the eyes of the public they

were private persons nevertheless they sowed in the minds of men seeds which

in the next generation have become an irresistible power herein is that

saying true one soweth and another reapeth we may imagine with plato

an ideal statesman in whom practice and speculation are perfectly harmonized

for there is no necessary opposition between them but experience shows that

they are commonly divorcedthe ordinary politician is the interpreter or

executor of the thoughts of others and hardly ever brings to the birth a new

political conception one or two only in modern times like the italian

statesman cavour have created the world in which they moved the philosopher

is naturally unfitted for political life his great ideas are not understood by

the many he is a thousand miles away from the questions of the day yet

perhaps the lives of thinkers as they are stiller and deeper are also happier

than the lives of those who are more in the public eye they have the promise

of the future though they are regarded as dreamers and visionaries by their

own contemporaries and when they are no longer here those who would have been

ashamed of them during their lives claim kindred with them and are proud to be

called by their names compare thucyd




who is the true poet




plato expels the poets from his republic because they are allied to sense

because they stimulate the emotions because they are thrice removed from the

ideal truth and in a similar spirit he declares in the gorgias that the

stately muse of tragedy is a votary of pleasure and not of truth in modern

times we almost ridicule the idea of poetry admitting of a moral the poet and

the prophet or preacher in primitive antiquity are one and the same but in

later ages they seem to fall apart the great art of novel writing that

peculiar creation of our own and the last century which together with the

sister art of review writing threatens to absorb all literature has even less

of seriousness in her composition do we not often hear the novel writer

censured for attempting to convey a lesson to the minds of his readers




yet the true office of a poet or writer of fiction is not merely to give

amusement or to be the expression of the feelings of mankind good or bad or

even to increase our knowledge of human nature there have been poets in modern

times such as goethe or wordsworth who have not forgotten their high vocation

of teachers and the two greatest of the greek dramatists owe their sublimity

to their ethical character the noblest truths sung of in the purest and

sweetest language are still the proper material of poetry the poet clothes

them with beauty and has a power of making them enter into the hearts and

memories of men he has not only to speak of themes above the level of ordinary

life but to speak of them in a deeper and tenderer way than they are

ordinarily felt so as to awaken the feeling of them in others the old he

makes young again the familiar principle he invests with a new dignity he

finds a noble expression for the commonplaces of morality and politics he

uses the things of sense so as to indicate what is beyond he raises us through

earth to heaven he expresses what the better part of us would fain say and

the halfconscious feeling is strengthened by the expression he is his own

critic for the spirit of poetry and of criticism are not divided in him his

mission is not to disguise men from themselves but to reveal to them their own

nature and make them better acquainted with the world around them true poetry

is the remembrance of youth of love the embodiment in words of the happiest

and holiest moments of life of the noblest thoughts of man of the greatest

deeds of the past the poet of the future may return to his greater calling of

the prophet or teacher indeed we hardly know what may not be effected for the

human race by a better use of the poetical and imaginative faculty the

reconciliation of poetry as of religion with truth may still be possible

neither is the element of pleasure to be excluded for when we substitute a

higher pleasure for a lower we raise men in the scale of existence might not

the novelist too make an ideal or rather many ideals of social life better

than a thousand sermons plato like the puritans is too much afraid of poetic

and artistic influences but he is not without a true sense of the noble

purposes to which art may be applied republic




modern poetry is often a sort of plaything or in platos language a

flattery a sophistry or sham in which without any serious purpose the poet

lends wings to his fancy and exhibits his gifts of language and metre such an

one seeks to gratify the taste of his readers he has the savoir

faire or trick of writing but he has not the higher spirit of poetry

he has no conception that true art should bring order out of disorder that it

should make provision for the souls highest interest that it should be

pursued only with a view to the improvement of the citizens he

ministers to the weaker side of human nature republic he idealizes the

sensual he sings the strain of love in the latest fashion instead of raising

men above themselves he brings them back to the tyranny of the many

masters from which all his life long a good man has been praying to be

delivered and often forgetful of measure and order he will express not that

which is truest but that which is strongest instead of a great and

noblyexecuted subject perfect in every part some fancy of a heated brain is

worked out with the strangest incongruity he is not the master of his words

but his wordsperhaps borrowed from anotherthe faded reflection of

some french or german or italian writer have the better of him though we are

not going to banish the poets how can we suppose that such utterances have any

healing or lifegiving influence on the minds of men




let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter art then must be

true and politics must be true and the life of man must be true and not a

seeming or sham in all of them order has to be brought out of disorder truth

out of error and falsehood this is what we mean by the greatest improvement of

man and so having considered in what way we can best spend the

appointed time we leave the result with god plato does not say that

god will order all things for the best compare phaedo but he indirectly

implies that the evils of this life will be corrected in another and as we are

very far from the best imaginable world at present plato here as in the

phaedo and republic supposes a purgatory or place of education for mankind in

general and for a very few a tartarus or hell the myth which terminates the

dialogue is not the revelation but rather like all similar descriptions

whether in the bible or plato the veil of another life for no visible thing

can reveal the invisible of this plato unlike some commentators on scripture

is fully aware neither will he dogmatize about the manner in which we are

born again republic only he is prepared to maintain the

ultimate triumph of truth and right and declares that no one not even the

wisest of the greeks can affirm any other doctrine without being ridiculous




there is a further paradox of ethics in which pleasure and pain are held to be

indifferent and virtue at the time of action and without regard to

consequences is happiness from this elevation or exaggeration of feeling plato

seems to shrink he leaves it to the stoics in a later generation to maintain

that when impaled or on the rack the philosopher may be happy compare

republic it is observable that in the republic he raises this question but

it is not really discussed the veil of the ideal state the shadow of another

life are allowed to descend upon it and it passes out of sight the martyr or

sufferer in the cause of right or truth is often supposed to die in raptures

having his eye fixed on a city which is in heaven but if there were no future

might he not still be happy in the performance of an action which was attended

only by a painful death he himself may be ready to thank god that he was

thought worthy to do him the least service without looking for a reward the

joys of another life may not have been present to his mind at all do we

suppose that the mediaeval saint st bernard st francis st catharine of

sienna or the catholic priest who lately devoted himself to death by a

lingering disease that he might solace and help others was thinking of the

sweets of heaven no the work was already heaven to him and

enough much less will the dying patriot be dreaming of the praises of man or

of an immortality of fame the sense of duty of right and trust in god will

be sufficient and as far as the mind can reach in that hour if he were

certain that there were no life to come he would not have wished to speak or

act otherwise than he did in the cause of truth or of humanity neither on the

other hand will he suppose that god has forsaken him or that the future is to

be a mere blank to him the greatest act of faith the only faith which cannot

pass away is his who has not known but yet has believed a very few among the

sons of men have made themselves independent of circumstances past present

or to come he who has attained to such a temper of mind has already present

with him eternal life he needs no arguments to convince him of immortality he

has in him already a principle stronger than death he who serves man without

the thought of reward is deemed to be a more faithful servant than he who works

for hire may not the service of god which is the more disinterested be in

like manner the higher and although only a very few in the course of the

worlds historychrist himself being one of themhave

attained to such a noble conception of god and of the human soul yet the ideal

of them may be present to us and the remembrance of them be an example to us

and their lives may shed a light on many dark places both of philosophy and

theology




the myths of plato




the myths of plato are a phenomenon unique in literature there are four longer

ones these occur in the phaedrus phaedo gorgias and republic that in the

republic is the most elaborate and finished of them three of these greater

myths namely those contained in the phaedo the gorgias and the republic

relate to the destiny of human souls in a future life the magnificent myth in

the phaedrus treats of the immortality or rather the eternity of the soul in

which is included a former as well as a future state of existence to these may

be added  the myth or rather fable occurring in the statesman in which

the life of innocence is contrasted with the ordinary life of man and the

consciousness of evil  the legend of the island of atlantis an imaginary

history which is a fragment only commenced in the timaeus and continued in

the critias  the much less artistic fiction of the foundation of the cretan

colony which is introduced in the preface to the laws but soon falls into the

background  the beautiful but rather artificial tale of prometheus and

epimetheus narrated in his rhetorical manner by protagoras in the dialogue

called after him  the speech at the beginning of the phaedrus which is a

parody of the orator lysias the rival speech of socrates and the recantation

of it to these may be added  the tale of the grasshoppers and  the tale

of thamus and of theuth both in the phaedrus  the parable of the cave

republic in which the previous argument is recapitulated and the nature and

degrees of knowledge having been previously set forth in the abstract are

represented in a picture  the fiction of the earthborn men republic

compare laws in which by the adaptation of an old tradition plato makes a new

beginning for his society  the myth of aristophanes respecting the

division of the sexes sym  the parable of the noble captain the pilot

and the mutinous sailors republic in which is represented the relation of

the better part of the world and of the philosopher to the mob of

politicians  the ironical tale of the pilot who plies between athens and

aegina charging only a small payment for saving men from death the reason

being that he is uncertain whether to live or die is better for them gor

 the treatment of freemen and citizens by physicians and of slaves by their

apprenticesa somewhat laboured figure of speech intended to illustrate

the two different ways in which the laws speak to men laws there also occur

in plato continuous images some of them extend over several pages appearing

and reappearing at intervals such as the bees stinging and stingless paupers

and thieves in the eighth book of the republic who are generated in the

transition from timocracy to oligarchy the sun which is to the visible world

what the idea of good is to the intellectual in the sixth book of the

republic the composite animal having the form of a man but containing under

a human skin a lion and a manyheaded monster republic the great beast ie

the populace and the wild beast within us meaning the passions which are

always liable to break out the animated comparisons of the degradation of

philosophy by the arts to the dishonoured maiden and of the tyrant to the

parricide who beats his father having first taken away his

arms the dog who is your only philosopher the grotesque and rather

paltry image of the argument wandering about without a head laws which is

repeated not improved from the gorgias the argument personified as veiling

her face republic as engaged in a chase as breaking upon us in a first

second and third waveon these figures of speech the changes are rung

many times over it is observable that nearly all these parables or continuous

images are found in the republic that which occurs in the theaetetus of the

midwifery of socrates is perhaps the only exception to make the list

complete the mathematical figure of the number of the state republic or the

numerical interval which separates king from tyrant should not be forgotten




the myth in the gorgias is one of those descriptions of another life which

like the sixth aeneid of virgil appear to contain reminiscences of the

mysteries it is a vision of the rewards and punishments which await good and

bad men after death it supposes the body to continue and to be in another

world what it has become in this it includes a paradiso purgatorio and

inferno like the sister myths of the phaedo and the republic the inferno is

reserved for great criminals only the argument of the dialogue is frequently

referred to and the meaning breaks through so as rather to destroy the

liveliness and consistency of the picture the structure of the fiction is very

slight the chief point or moral being that in the judgments of another world

there is no possibility of concealment zeus has taken from men the power of

foreseeing death and brings together the souls both of them and their judges

naked and undisguised at the judgmentseat both are exposed to view stripped

of the veils and clothes which might prevent them from seeing into or being

seen by one another




the myth of the phaedo is of the same type but it is more cosmological and

also more poetical the beautiful and ingenious fancy occurs to plato that the

upper atmosphere is an earth and heaven in one a glorified earth fairer and

purer than that in which we dwell as the fishes live in the ocean mankind are

living in a lower sphere out of which they put their heads for a moment or two

and behold a world beyond the earth which we inhabit is a sediment of the

coarser particles which drop from the world above and is to that heavenly

earth what the desert and the shores of the ocean are to us a part of the myth

consists of description of the interior of the earth which gives the

opportunity of introducing several mythological names and of providing places

of torment for the wicked there is no clear distinction of soul and body the

spirits beneath the earth are spoken of as souls only yet they retain a sort

of shadowy form when they cry for mercy on the shores of the lake and the

philosopher alone is said to have got rid of the body all the three myths in

plato which relate to the world below have a place for repentant sinners as

well as other homes or places for the very good and very bad it is a natural

reflection which is made by plato elsewhere that the two extremes of human

character are rarely met with and that the generality of mankind are between

them hence a place must be found for them in the myth of the phaedo they are

carried down the river acheron to the acherusian lake where they dwell and

are purified of their evil deeds and receive the rewards of their good there

are also incurable sinners who are cast into tartarus there to remain as the

penalty of atrocious crimes these suffer everlastingly and there is another

class of hardlycurable sinners who are allowed from time to time to approach

the shores of the acherusian lake where they cry to their victims for mercy

which if they obtain they come out into the lake and cease from their torments




neither this nor any of the three greater myths of plato nor perhaps any

allegory or parable relating to the unseen world is consistent with itself

the language of philosophy mingles with that of mythology abstract ideas are

transformed into persons figures of speech into realities these myths may be

compared with the pilgrims progress of bunyan in which discussions of

theology are mixed up with the incidents of travel and mythological personages

are associated with human beings they are also garnished with names and

phrases taken out of homer and with other fragments of greek tradition




the myth of the republic is more subtle and also more consistent than either of

the two others it has a greater verisimilitude than they have and is full of

touches which recall the experiences of human life it will be noticed by an

attentive reader that the twelve days during which er lay in a trance after he

was slain coincide with the time passed by the spirits in their pilgrimage it

is a curious observation not often made that good men who have lived in a

wellgoverned city shall we say in a religious and respectable society are

more likely to make mistakes in their choice of life than those who have had

more experience of the world and of evil it is a more familiar remark that we

constantly blame others when we have only ourselves to blame and the

philosopher must acknowledge however reluctantly that there is an element of

chance in human life with which it is sometimes impossible for man to cope

that men drink more of the waters of forgetfulness than is good for them is a

poetical description of a familiar truth we have many of us known men who

like odysseus have wearied of ambition and have only desired rest we should

like to know what became of the infants dying almost as soon as they

were born but plato only raises without satisfying our curiosity the

two companies of souls ascending and descending at either chasm of heaven and

earth and conversing when they come out into the meadow the majestic figures

of the judges sitting in heaven the voice heard by ardiaeus are features of

the great allegory which have an indescribable grandeur and power the remark

already made respecting the inconsistency of the two other myths must be

extended also to this it is at once an orrery or model of the heavens and a

picture of the day of judgment




the three myths are unlike anything else in plato there is an oriental or

rather an egyptian element in them and they have an affinity to the mysteries

and to the orphic modes of worship to a certain extent they are ungreek at

any rate there is hardly anything like them in other greek writings which have

a serious purpose in spirit they are mediaeval they are akin to what may be

termed the underground religion in all ages and countries they are presented

in the most lively and graphic manner but they are never insisted on as true

it is only affirmed that nothing better can be said about a future life plato

seems to make use of them when he has reached the limits of human knowledge

or to borrow an expression of his own when he is standing on the outside of

the intellectual world they are very simple in style a few touches bring the

picture home to the mind and make it present to us they have also a kind of

authority gained by the employment of sacred and familiar names just as mere

fragments of the words of scripture put together in any form and applied to

any subject have a power of their own they are a substitute for poetry and

mythology and they are also a reform of mythology the moral of them may be

summed up in a word or two after death the judgment and there is some

better thing remaining for the good than for the evil




all literature gathers into itself many elements of the past for example the

tale of the earthborn men in the republic appears at first sight to be an

extravagant fancy but it is restored to propriety when we remember that it is

based on a legendary belief the art of making stories of ghosts and

apparitions credible is said to consist in the manner of telling them the

effect is gained by many literary and conversational devices such as the

previous raising of curiosity the mention of little circumstances simplicity

picturesqueness the naturalness of the occasion and the like this art is

possessed by plato in a degree which has never been equalled




the myth in the phaedrus is even greater than the myths which have been already

described but is of a different character it treats of a former rather than

of a future life it represents the conflict of reason aided by passion or

righteous indignation on the one hand and of the animal lusts and instincts on

the other the soul of man has followed the company of some god and seen truth

in the form of the universal before it was born in this world our present life

is the result of the struggle which was then carried on this world is relative

to a former world as it is often projected into a future we ask the question

where were men before birth as we likewise enquire what will become of them

after death the first question is unfamiliar to us and therefore seems to be

unnatural but if we survey the whole human race it has been as influential

and as widely spread as the other in the phaedrus it is really a figure of

speech in which the spiritual combat of this life is represented

the majesty and power of the whole passageespecially of what may be

called the theme or proem beginning the mind through all her being is

immortalcan only be rendered very inadequately in another

language




the myth in the statesman relates to a former cycle of existence in which men

were born of the earth and by the reversal of the earths motion had

their lives reversed and were restored to youth and beauty the dead came to

life the old grew middleaged and the middleaged young the youth became a

child the child an infant the infant vanished into the earth the connection

between the reversal of the earths motion and the reversal of human life

is of course verbal only yet plato like theologians in other ages argues

from the consistency of the tale to its truth the new order of the world was

immediately under the government of god it was a state of innocence in which

men had neither wants nor cares in which the earth brought forth all things

spontaneously and god was to man what man now is to the animals there were no

great estates or families or private possessions nor any traditions of the

past because men were all born out of the earth this is what plato calls the

reign of cronos and in like manner he connects the reversal of

the earths motion with some legend of which he himself was probably the

inventor




the question is then asked under which of these two cycles of existence was

man the happierunder that of cronos which was a state of innocence or

that of zeus which is our ordinary life for a while plato balances the two

sides of the serious controversy which he has suggested in a figure the

answer depends on another question what use did the children of cronos make of

their time they had boundless leisure and the faculty of discoursing not only

with one another but with the animals did they employ these advantages with a

view to philosophy gathering from every nature some addition to their store of

knowledge or did they pass their time in eating and drinking and telling

stories to one another and to the beastsin either case there would be

no difficulty in answering but then as plato rather mischievously adds

nobody knows what they did and therefore the doubt must remain

undetermined




to the first there succeeds a second epoch after another natural convulsion

in which the order of the world and of human life is once more reversed god

withdraws his guiding hand and man is left to the government of himself the

world begins again and arts and laws are slowly and painfully invented a

secular age succeeds to a theocratical in this fanciful tale plato has

dropped or almost dropped the garb of mythology he suggests several curious

and important thoughts such as the possibility of a state of innocence the

existence of a world without traditions and the difference between human and

divine government he has also carried a step further his speculations

concerning the abolition of the family and of property which he supposes to

have no place among the children of cronos any more than in the ideal state




it is characteristic of plato and of his age to pass from the abstract to the

concrete from poetry to reality language is the expression of the seen and

also of the unseen and moves in a region between them a great writer knows

how to strike both these chords sometimes remaining within the sphere of the

visible and then again comprehending a wider range and soaring to the abstract

and universal even in the same sentence he may employ both modes of speech not

improperly or inharmoniously it is useless to criticise the broken metaphors

of plato if the effect of the whole is to create a picture not such as can be

painted on canvas but which is full of life and meaning to the reader a poem

may be contained in a word or two which may call up not one but many latent

images or half reveal to us by a sudden flash the thoughts of many hearts

often the rapid transition from one image to another is pleasing to us on the

other hand any single figure of speech if too often repeated or worked out

too much at length becomes prosy and monotonous in theology and philosophy we

necessarily include both the moral law within and the starry heaven

above and pass from one to the other compare for examples psalms

xviii and xix whether such a use of language is puerile or noble depends

upon the genius of the writer or speaker and the familiarity of the

associations employed




in the myths and parables of plato the ease and grace of conversation is not

forgotten they are spoken not written words stories which are told to a

living audience and so well told that we are more than halfinclined to

believe them compare phaedrus as in conversation too the striking image or

figure of speech is not forgotten but is quickly caught up and alluded to

again and again as it would still be in our own day in a genial and

sympathetic society the descriptions of plato have a greater life and reality

than is to be found in any modern writing this is due to their homeliness and

simplicity plato can do with words just as he pleases to him they are indeed

more plastic than wax republic we are in the habit of opposing

speech and writing poetry and prose but he has discovered a use of language

in which they are united which gives a fitting expression to the highest

truths and in which the trifles of courtesy and the familiarities of daily

life are not overlooked





gorgias
by plato
translated by benjamin jowett


persons of the dialogue callicles socrates chaerephon gorgias polus




scene the house of callicles




callicles the wise man as the proverb says is late for a fray but not for a

feast




socrates and are we late for a feast




callicles yes and a delightful feast for gorgias has just been exhibiting to

us many fine things




socrates it is not my fault callicles our friend chaerephon is to blame for

he would keep us loitering in the agora




chaerephon never mind socrates the misfortune of which i have been the cause

i will also repair for gorgias is a friend of mine and i will make him give

the exhibition again either now or if you prefer at some other time




callicles what is the matter chaerephondoes socrates want to hear

gorgias




chaerephon yes that was our intention in coming




callicles come into my house then for gorgias is staying with me and he

shall exhibit to you




socrates very good callicles but will he answer our questions for i want to

hear from him what is the nature of his art and what it is which he professes

and teaches he may as you chaerephon suggest defer the exhibition to some

other time




callicles there is nothing like asking him socrates and indeed to answer

questions is a part of his exhibition for he was saying only just now that

any one in my house might put any question to him and that he would answer




socrates how fortunate will you ask him chaerephon




chaerephon what shall i ask him




socrates ask him who he is




chaerephon what do you mean




socrates i mean such a question as would elicit from him if he had been a

maker of shoes the answer that he is a cobbler do you understand




chaerephon i understand and will ask him tell me gorgias is our friend

callicles right in saying that you undertake to answer any questions which you

are asked




gorgias quite right chaerephon i was saying as much only just now and i may

add that many years have elapsed since any one has asked me a new one




chaerephon then you must be very ready gorgias




gorgias of that chaerephon you can make trial




polus yes indeed and if you like chaerephon you may make trial of me too

for i think that gorgias who has been talking a long time is tired




chaerephon and do you polus think that you can answer better than gorgias




polus what does that matter if i answer well enough for you




chaerephon not at alland you shall answer if you like




polus ask




chaerephon my question is this if gorgias had the skill of his brother

herodicus what ought we to call him ought he not to have the name which is

given to his brother




polus certainly




chaerephon then we should be right in calling him a physician




polus yes




chaerephon and if he had the skill of aristophon the son of aglaophon or of

his brother polygnotus what ought we to call him




polus clearly a painter




chaerephon but now what shall we call himwhat is the art in which he is

skilled




polus o chaerephon there are many arts among mankind which are experimental

and have their origin in experience for experience makes the days of men to

proceed according to art and inexperience according to chance and different

persons in different ways are proficient in different arts and the best

persons in the best arts and our friend gorgias is one of the best and the

art in which he is a proficient is the noblest




socrates polus has been taught how to make a capital speech gorgias but he

is not fulfilling the promise which he made to chaerephon




gorgias what do you mean socrates




socrates i mean that he has not exactly answered the question which he was

asked




gorgias then why not ask him yourself




socrates but i would much rather ask you if you are disposed to answer for i

see from the few words which polus has uttered that he has attended more to

the art which is called rhetoric than to dialectic




polus what makes you say so socrates




socrates because polus when chaerephon asked you what was the art which

gorgias knows you praised it as if you were answering some one who found fault

with it but you never said what the art was




polus why did i not say that it was the noblest of arts




socrates yes indeed but that was no answer to the question nobody asked

what was the quality but what was the nature of the art and by what name we

were to describe gorgias and i would still beg you briefly and clearly as you

answered chaerephon when he asked you at first to say what this art is and

what we ought to call gorgias or rather gorgias let me turn to you and ask

the same questionwhat are we to call you and what is the art which you

profess




gorgias rhetoric socrates is my art




socrates then i am to call you a rhetorician




gorgias yes socrates and a good one too if you would call me that which in

homeric language i boast myself to be




socrates i should wish to do so




gorgias then pray do




socrates and are we to say that you are able to make other men rhetoricians




gorgias yes that is exactly what i profess to make them not only at athens

but in all places




socrates and will you continue to ask and answer questions gorgias as we are

at present doing and reserve for another occasion the longer mode of speech

which polus was attempting will you keep your promise and answer shortly the

questions which are asked of you




gorgias some answers socrates are of necessity longer but i will do my best

to make them as short as possible for a part of my profession is that i can be

as short as any one




socrates that is what is wanted gorgias exhibit the shorter method now and

the longer one at some other time




gorgias well i will and you will certainly say that you never heard a man

use fewer words




socrates very good then as you profess to be a rhetorician and a maker of

rhetoricians let me ask you with what is rhetoric concerned i might ask with

what is weaving concerned and you would reply would you not with the

making of garments




gorgias yes




socrates and music is concerned with the composition of melodies




gorgias it is




socrates by here gorgias i admire the surpassing brevity of your answers




gorgias yes socrates i do think myself good at that




socrates i am glad to hear it answer me in like manner about rhetoric with

what is rhetoric concerned




gorgias with discourse




socrates what sort of discourse gorgiassuch discourse as would teach

the sick under what treatment they might get well




gorgias no




socrates then rhetoric does not treat of all kinds of discourse




gorgias certainly not




socrates and yet rhetoric makes men able to speak




gorgias yes




socrates and to understand that about which they speak




gorgias of course




socrates but does not the art of medicine which we were just now mentioning

also make men able to understand and speak about the sick




gorgias certainly




socrates then medicine also treats of discourse




gorgias yes




socrates of discourse concerning diseases




gorgias just so




socrates and does not gymnastic also treat of discourse concerning the good or

evil condition of the body




gorgias very true




socrates and the same gorgias is true of the other artsall of them

treat of discourse concerning the subjects with which they severally have to

do




gorgias clearly




socrates then why if you call rhetoric the art which treats of discourse and

all the other arts treat of discourse do you not call them arts of rhetoric




gorgias because socrates the knowledge of the other arts has only to do with

some sort of external action as of the hand but there is no such action of

the hand in rhetoric which works and takes effect only through the medium of

discourse and therefore i am justified in saying that rhetoric treats of

discourse




socrates i am not sure whether i entirely understand you but i dare say i

shall soon know better please to answer me a questionyou would allow

that there are arts




gorgias yes




socrates as to the arts generally they are for the most part concerned with

doing and require little or no speaking in painting and statuary and many

other arts the work may proceed in silence and of such arts i suppose you

would say that they do not come within the province of rhetoric




gorgias you perfectly conceive my meaning socrates




socrates but there are other arts which work wholly through the medium of

language and require either no action or very little as for example the

arts of arithmetic of calculation of geometry and of playing draughts in

some of these speech is pretty nearly coextensive with action but in most of

them the verbal element is greaterthey depend wholly on words for their

efficacy and power and i take your meaning to be that rhetoric is an art of

this latter sort




gorgias exactly




socrates and yet i do not believe that you really mean to call any of these

arts rhetoric although the precise expression which you used was that

rhetoric is an art which works and takes effect only through the medium of

discourse and an adversary who wished to be captious might say and so

gorgias you call arithmetic rhetoric but i do not think that you

really call arithmetic rhetoric any more than geometry would be so called by

you




gorgias you are quite right socrates in your apprehension of my meaning




socrates well then let me now have the rest of my answerseeing that

rhetoric is one of those arts which works mainly by the use of words and there

are other arts which also use words tell me what is that quality in words with

which rhetoric is concernedsuppose that a person asks me about some of

the arts which i was mentioning just now he might say socrates what

is arithmetic and i should reply to him as you replied to me that

arithmetic is one of those arts which take effect through words and then he

would proceed to ask words about what and i should reply words

about odd and even numbers and how many there are of each and if he asked

again what is the art of calculation i should say that also is

one of the arts which is concerned wholly with words and if he further said

concerned with what i should say like the clerks in the

assembly as aforesaid of arithmetic but with a difference the

difference being that the art of calculation considers not only the quantities

of odd and even numbers but also their numerical relations to themselves and

to one another and suppose again i were to say that astronomy is only

wordshe would ask words about what socrates and i

should answer that astronomy tells us about the motions of the stars and sun

and moon and their relative swiftness




gorgias you would be quite right socrates




socrates and now let us have from you gorgias the truth about rhetoric

which you would admit would you not to be one of those arts which act always

and fulfil all their ends through the medium of words




gorgias true




socrates words which do what i should ask to what class of things do the

words which rhetoric uses relate




gorgias to the greatest socrates and the best of human things




socrates that again gorgias is ambiguous i am still in the dark for which

are the greatest and best of human things i dare say that you have heard men

singing at feasts the old drinking song in which the singers enumerate the

goods of life first health beauty next thirdly as the writer of the song

says wealth honestly obtained




gorgias yes i know the song but what is your drift




socrates i mean to say that the producers of those things which the author of

the song praises that is to say the physician the trainer the moneymaker

will at once come to you and first the physician will say o socrates

gorgias is deceiving you for my art is concerned with the greatest good of men

and not his and when i ask who are you he will reply i am a

physician what do you mean i shall say do you mean that your art

produces the greatest good certainly he will answer for

is not health the greatest good what greater good can men have

socrates and after him the trainer will come and say i too

socrates shall be greatly surprised if gorgias can show more good of his art

than i can show of mine to him again i shall say who are you honest

friend and what is your business i am a trainer he will reply

and my business is to make men beautiful and strong in body when

i have done with the trainer there arrives the moneymaker and he as i

expect will utterly despise them all consider socrates he will

say whether gorgias or any one else can produce any greater good than

wealth well you and i say to him and are you a creator of wealth

yes he replies and who are you a moneymaker

and do you consider wealth to be the greatest good of man of

course will be his reply and we shall rejoin yes but our friend

gorgias contends that his art produces a greater good than yours and then he

will be sure to go on and ask what good let gorgias answer now

i want you gorgias to imagine that this question is asked of you by them and

by me what is that which as you say is the greatest good of man and of

which you are the creator answer us




gorgias that good socrates which is truly the greatest being that which

gives to men freedom in their own persons and to individuals the power of

ruling over others in their several states




socrates and what would you consider this to be




gorgias what is there greater than the word which persuades the judges in the

courts or the senators in the council or the citizens in the assembly or at

any other political meetingif you have the power of uttering this word

you will have the physician your slave and the trainer your slave and the

moneymaker of whom you talk will be found to gather treasures not for

himself but for you who are able to speak and to persuade the multitude




socrates now i think gorgias that you have very accurately explained what

you conceive to be the art of rhetoric and you mean to say if i am not

mistaken that rhetoric is the artificer of persuasion having this and no

other business and that this is her crown and end do you know any other

effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing persuasion




gorgias no the definition seems to me very fair socrates for persuasion is

the chief end of rhetoric




socrates then hear me gorgias for i am quite sure that if there ever was a

man who entered on the discussion of a matter from a pure love of knowing the

truth i am such a one and i should say the same of you




gorgias what is coming socrates




socrates i will tell you i am very well aware that i do not know what

according to you is the exact nature or what are the topics of that

persuasion of which you speak and which is given by rhetoric although i have

a suspicion about both the one and the other and i am going to askwhat

is this power of persuasion which is given by rhetoric and about what but

why if i have a suspicion do i ask instead of telling you not for your sake

but in order that the argument may proceed in such a manner as is most likely

to set forth the truth and i would have you observe that i am right in asking

this further question if i asked what sort of a painter is

zeuxis and you said the painter of figures should i not

be right in asking what kind of figures and where do you find

them




gorgias certainly




socrates and the reason for asking this second question would be that there

are other painters besides who paint many other figures




gorgias true




socrates but if there had been no one but zeuxis who painted them then you

would have answered very well




gorgias quite so




socrates now i want to know about rhetoric in the same wayis rhetoric

the only art which brings persuasion or do other arts have the same effect i

mean to saydoes he who teaches anything persuade men of that which he

teaches or not




gorgias he persuades socratesthere can be no mistake about that




socrates again if we take the arts of which we were just now

speakingdo not arithmetic and the arithmeticians teach us the

properties of number




gorgias certainly




socrates and therefore persuade us of them




gorgias yes




socrates then arithmetic as well as rhetoric is an artificer of persuasion




gorgias clearly




socrates and if any one asks us what sort of persuasion and about

whatwe shall answer persuasion which teaches the quantity of odd and

even and we shall be able to show that all the other arts of which we were

just now speaking are artificers of persuasion and of what sort and about

what




gorgias very true




socrates then rhetoric is not the only artificer of persuasion




gorgias true




socrates seeing then that not only rhetoric works by persuasion but that

other arts do the same as in the case of the painter a question has arisen

which is a very fair one of what persuasion is rhetoric the artificer and

about whatis not that a fair way of putting the question




gorgias i think so




socrates then if you approve the question gorgias what is the answer




gorgias i answer socrates that rhetoric is the art of persuasion in courts

of law and other assemblies as i was just now saying and about the just and

unjust




socrates and that gorgias was what i was suspecting to be your notion yet i

would not have you wonder if byandby i am found repeating a seemingly plain

question for i ask not in order to confute you but as i was saying that the

argument may proceed consecutively and that we may not get the habit of

anticipating and suspecting the meaning of one anothers words i would

have you develope your own views in your own way whatever may be your

hypothesis




gorgias i think that you are quite right socrates




socrates then let me raise another question there is such a thing as

having learned




gorgias yes




socrates and there is also having believed




gorgias yes




socrates and is the having learned the same as having

believed and are learning and belief the same things




gorgias in my judgment socrates they are not the same




socrates and your judgment is right as you may ascertain in this

wayif a person were to say to you is there gorgias a false

belief as well as a trueyou would reply if i am not mistaken

that there is




gorgias yes




socrates well but is there a false knowledge as well as a true




gorgias no




socrates no indeed and this again proves that knowledge and belief differ




gorgias very true




socrates and yet those who have learned as well as those who have believed are

persuaded




gorgias just so




socrates shall we then assume two sorts of persuasionone which is the

source of belief without knowledge as the other is of knowledge




gorgias by all means




socrates and which sort of persuasion does rhetoric create in courts of law

and other assemblies about the just and unjust the sort of persuasion which

gives belief without knowledge or that which gives knowledge




gorgias clearly socrates that which only gives belief




socrates then rhetoric as would appear is the artificer of a persuasion

which creates belief about the just and unjust but gives no instruction about

them




gorgias true




socrates and the rhetorician does not instruct the courts of law or other

assemblies about things just and unjust but he creates belief about them for

no one can be supposed to instruct such a vast multitude about such high

matters in a short time




gorgias certainly not




socrates come then and let us see what we really mean about rhetoric for i

do not know what my own meaning is as yet when the assembly meets to elect a

physician or a shipwright or any other craftsman will the rhetorician be taken

into counsel surely not for at every election he ought to be chosen who is

most skilled and again when walls have to be built or harbours or docks to

be constructed not the rhetorician but the master workman will advise or when

generals have to be chosen and an order of battle arranged or a position

taken then the military will advise and not the rhetoricians what do you say

gorgias since you profess to be a rhetorician and a maker of rhetoricians i

cannot do better than learn the nature of your art from you and here let me

assure you that i have your interest in view as well as my own for likely

enough some one or other of the young men present might desire to become your

pupil and in fact i see some and a good many too who have this wish but

they would be too modest to question you and therefore when you are

interrogated by me i would have you imagine that you are interrogated by them

what is the use of coming to you gorgias they will

sayabout what will you teach us to advise the stateabout

the just and unjust only or about those other things also which socrates has

just mentioned how will you answer them




gorgias i like your way of leading us on socrates and i will endeavour to

reveal to you the whole nature of rhetoric you must have heard i think that

the docks and the walls of the athenians and the plan of the harbour were

devised in accordance with the counsels partly of themistocles and partly of

pericles and not at the suggestion of the builders




socrates such is the tradition gorgias about themistocles and i myself

heard the speech of pericles when he advised us about the middle wall




gorgias and you will observe socrates that when a decision has to be given

in such matters the rhetoricians are the advisers they are the men who win

their point




socrates i had that in my admiring mind gorgias when i asked what is the

nature of rhetoric which always appears to me when i look at the matter in

this way to be a marvel of greatness




gorgias a marvel indeed socrates if you only knew how rhetoric comprehends

and holds under her sway all the inferior arts let me offer you a striking

example of this on several occasions i have been with my brother herodicus or

some other physician to see one of his patients who would not allow the

physician to give him medicine or apply the knife or hot iron to him and i

have persuaded him to do for me what he would not do for the physician just by

the use of rhetoric and i say that if a rhetorician and a physician were to go

to any city and had there to argue in the ecclesia or any other assembly as to

which of them should be elected statephysician the physician would have no

chance but he who could speak would be chosen if he wished and in a contest

with a man of any other profession the rhetorician more than any one would have

the power of getting himself chosen for he can speak more persuasively to the

multitude than any of them and on any subject such is the nature and power of

the art of rhetoric and yet socrates rhetoric should be used like any other

competitive art not against everybodythe rhetorician ought not to

abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or pancratiast or other master of

fencebecause he has powers which are more than a match either for

friend or enemy he ought not therefore to strike stab or slay his friends

suppose a man to have been trained in the palestra and to be a skilful

boxerhe in the fulness of his strength goes and strikes his father or

mother or one of his familiars or friends but that is no reason why the

trainers or fencingmasters should be held in detestation or banished from the

citysurely not for they taught their art for a good purpose to be

used against enemies and evildoers in selfdefence not in aggression and

others have perverted their instructions and turned to a bad use their own

strength and skill but not on this account are the teachers bad neither is

the art in fault or bad in itself i should rather say that those who make a

bad use of the art are to blame and the same argument holds good of rhetoric

for the rhetorician can speak against all men and upon any subjectin

short he can persuade the multitude better than any other man of anything

which he pleases but he should not therefore seek to defraud the physician or

any other artist of his reputation merely because he has the power he ought to

use rhetoric fairly as he would also use his athletic powers and if after

having become a rhetorician he makes a bad use of his strength and skill his

instructor surely ought not on that account to be held in detestation or

banished for he was intended by his teacher to make a good use of his

instructions but he abuses them and therefore he is the person who ought to

be held in detestation banished and put to death and not his instructor




socrates you gorgias like myself have had great experience of disputations

and you must have observed i think that they do not always terminate in

mutual edification or in the definition by either party of the subjects which

they are discussing but disagreements are apt to arisesomebody says

that another has not spoken truly or clearly and then they get into a passion

and begin to quarrel both parties conceiving that their opponents are arguing

from personal feeling only and jealousy of themselves not from any interest in

the question at issue and sometimes they will go on abusing one another until

the company at last are quite vexed at themselves for ever listening to such

fellows why do i say this why because i cannot help feeling that you are now

saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at

first about rhetoric and i am afraid to point this out to you lest you should

think that i have some animosity against you and that i speak not for the

sake of discovering the truth but from jealousy of you now if you are one of

my sort i should like to crossexamine you but if not i will let you alone

and what is my sort you will ask i am one of those who are very willing to be

refuted if i say anything which is not true and very willing to refute any one

else who says what is not true and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute

for i hold that this is the greater gain of the two just as the gain is

greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another for i

imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous

opinion about the matters of which we are speaking and if you claim to be one

of my sort let us have the discussion out but if you would rather have done

no matterlet us make an end of it




gorgias i should say socrates that i am quite the man whom you indicate

but perhaps we ought to consider the audience for before you came i had

already given a long exhibition and if we proceed the argument may run on to a

great length and therefore i think that we should consider whether we may not

be detaining some part of the company when they are wanting to do something

else




chaerephon you hear the audience cheering gorgias and socrates which shows

their desire to listen to you and for myself heaven forbid that i should have

any business on hand which would take me away from a discussion so interesting

and so ably maintained




callicles by the gods chaerephon although i have been present at many

discussions i doubt whether i was ever so much delighted before and therefore

if you go on discoursing all day i shall be the better pleased




socrates i may truly say callicles that i am willing if gorgias is




gorgias after all this socrates i should be disgraced if i refused

especially as i have promised to answer all comers in accordance with the

wishes of the company then do you begin and ask of me any question which you

like




socrates let me tell you then gorgias what surprises me in your words

though i dare say that you may be right and i may have misunderstood your

meaning you say that you can make any man who will learn of you a

rhetorician




gorgias yes




socrates do you mean that you will teach him to gain the ears of the multitude

on any subject and this not by instruction but by persuasion




gorgias quite so




socrates you were saying in fact that the rhetorician will have greater

powers of persuasion than the physician even in a matter of health




gorgias yes with the multitudethat is




socrates you mean to say with the ignorant for with those who know he cannot

be supposed to have greater powers of persuasion




gorgias very true




socrates but if he is to have more power of persuasion than the physician he

will have greater power than he who knows




gorgias certainly




socrates although he is not a physicianis he




gorgias no




socrates and he who is not a physician must obviously be ignorant of what

the physician knows




gorgias clearly




socrates then when the rhetorician is more persuasive than the physician the

ignorant is more persuasive with the ignorant than he who has

knowledgeis not that the inference




gorgias in the case supposedyes




socrates and the same holds of the relation of rhetoric to all the other arts

the rhetorician need not know the truth about things he has only to discover

some way of persuading the ignorant that he has more knowledge than those who

know




gorgias yes socrates and is not this a great comfortnot to have

learned the other arts but the art of rhetoric only and yet to be in no way

inferior to the professors of them




socrates whether the rhetorician is or not inferior on this account is a

question which we will hereafter examine if the enquiry is likely to be of any

service to us but i would rather begin by asking whether he is or is not as

ignorant of the just and unjust base and honourable good and evil as he is

of medicine and the other arts i mean to say does he really know anything of

what is good and evil base or honourable just or unjust in them or has he

only a way with the ignorant of persuading them that he not knowing is to be

esteemed to know more about these things than some one else who knows or must

the pupil know these things and come to you knowing them before he can acquire

the art of rhetoric if he is ignorant you who are the teacher of rhetoric

will not teach himit is not your business but you will make him seem to

the multitude to know them when he does not know them and seem to be a good

man when he is not or will you be unable to teach him rhetoric at all unless

he knows the truth of these things first what is to be said about all this by

heavens gorgias i wish that you would reveal to me the power of rhetoric as

you were saying that you would




gorgias well socrates i suppose that if the pupil does chance not to know

them he will have to learn of me these things as well




socrates say no more for there you are right and so he whom you make a

rhetorician must either know the nature of the just and unjust already or he

must be taught by you




gorgias certainly




socrates well and is not he who has learned carpentering a carpenter




gorgias yes




socrates and he who has learned music a musician




gorgias yes




socrates and he who has learned medicine is a physician in like manner he

who has learned anything whatever is that which his knowledge makes him




gorgias certainly




socrates and in the same way he who has learned what is just is just




gorgias to be sure




socrates and he who is just may be supposed to do what is just




gorgias yes




socrates and must not the just man always desire to do what is just




gorgias that is clearly the inference




socrates surely then the just man will never consent to do injustice




gorgias certainly not




socrates and according to the argument the rhetorician must be a just man




gorgias yes




socrates and will therefore never be willing to do injustice




gorgias clearly not




socrates but do you remember saying just now that the trainer is not to be

accused or banished if the pugilist makes a wrong use of his pugilistic art

and in like manner if the rhetorician makes a bad and unjust use of his

rhetoric that is not to be laid to the charge of his teacher who is not to be

banished but the wrongdoer himself who made a bad use of his

rhetoriche is to be banishedwas not that said




gorgias yes it was




socrates but now we are affirming that the aforesaid rhetorician will never

have done injustice at all




gorgias true




socrates and at the very outset gorgias it was said that rhetoric treated of

discourse not like arithmetic about odd and even but about just and unjust

was not this said




gorgias yes




socrates i was thinking at the time when i heard you saying so that

rhetoric which is always discoursing about justice could not possibly be an

unjust thing but when you added shortly afterwards that the rhetorician

might make a bad use of rhetoric i noted with surprise the inconsistency into

which you had fallen and i said that if you thought as i did that there was

a gain in being refuted there would be an advantage in going on with the

question but if not i would leave off and in the course of our

investigations as you will see yourself the rhetorician has been acknowledged

to be incapable of making an unjust use of rhetoric or of willingness to do

injustice by the dog gorgias there will be a great deal of discussion

before we get at the truth of all this




polus and do even you socrates seriously believe what you are now saying

about rhetoric what because gorgias was ashamed to deny that the rhetorician

knew the just and the honourable and the good and admitted that to any one who

came to him ignorant of them he could teach them and then out of this

admission there arose a contradictionthe thing which you dearly love

and to which not he but you brought the argument by your captious

questionsdo you seriously believe that there is any truth in all this

for will any one ever acknowledge that he does not know or cannot teach the

nature of justice the truth is that there is great want of manners in

bringing the argument to such a pass




socrates illustrious polus the reason why we provide ourselves with friends

and children is that when we get old and stumble a younger generation may be

at hand to set us on our legs again in our words and in our actions and now

if i and gorgias are stumbling here are you who should raise us up and i for

my part engage to retract any error into which you may think that i have

fallenupon one condition




polus what condition




socrates that you contract polus the prolixity of speech in which you

indulged at first




polus what do you mean that i may not use as many words as i please




socrates only to think my friend that having come on a visit to athens

which is the most freespoken state in hellas you when you got there and you

alone should be deprived of the power of speechthat would be hard

indeed but then consider my caseshall not i be very hardly used if

when you are making a long oration and refusing to answer what you are asked

i am compelled to stay and listen to you and may not go away i say rather if

you have a real interest in the argument or to repeat my former expression

have any desire to set it on its legs take back any statement which you

please and in your turn ask and answer like myself and gorgiasrefute

and be refuted for i suppose that you would claim to know what gorgias

knowswould you not




polus yes




socrates and you like him invite any one to ask you about anything which he

pleases and you will know how to answer him




polus to be sure




socrates and now which will you do ask or answer




polus i will ask and do you answer me socrates the same question which

gorgias as you suppose is unable to answer what is rhetoric




socrates do you mean what sort of an art




polus yes




socrates to say the truth polus it is not an art at all in my opinion




polus then what in your opinion is rhetoric




socrates a thing which as i was lately reading in a book of yours you say

that you have made an art




polus what thing




socrates i should say a sort of experience




polus does rhetoric seem to you to be an experience




socrates that is my view but you may be of another mind




polus an experience in what




socrates an experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification




polus and if able to gratify others must not rhetoric be a fine thing




socrates what are you saying polus why do you ask me whether rhetoric is a

fine thing or not when i have not as yet told you what rhetoric is




polus did i not hear you say that rhetoric was a sort of experience




socrates will you who are so desirous to gratify others afford a slight

gratification to me




polus i will




socrates will you ask me what sort of an art is cookery




polus what sort of an art is cookery




socrates not an art at all polus




polus what then




socrates i should say an experience




polus in what i wish that you would explain to me




socrates an experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification

polus




polus then are cookery and rhetoric the same




socrates no they are only different parts of the same profession




polus of what profession




socrates i am afraid that the truth may seem discourteous and i hesitate to

answer lest gorgias should imagine that i am making fun of his own profession

for whether or not this is that art of rhetoric which gorgias practises i

really cannot tellfrom what he was just now saying nothing appeared of

what he thought of his art but the rhetoric which i mean is a part of a not

very creditable whole




gorgias a part of what socrates say what you mean and never mind me




socrates in my opinion then gorgias the whole of which rhetoric is a part is

not an art at all but the habit of a bold and ready wit which knows how to

manage mankind this habit i sum up under the word flattery and

it appears to me to have many other parts one of which is cookery which may

seem to be an art but as i maintain is only an experience or routine and not

an artanother part is rhetoric and the art of attiring and sophistry

are two others thus there are four branches and four different things

answering to them and polus may ask if he likes for he has not as yet been

informed what part of flattery is rhetoric he did not see that i had not yet

answered him when he proceeded to ask a further question whether i do not

think rhetoric a fine thing but i shall not tell him whether rhetoric is a

fine thing or not until i have first answered what is rhetoric

for that would not be right polus but i shall be happy to answer if you will

ask me what part of flattery is rhetoric




polus i will ask and do you answer what part of flattery is rhetoric




socrates will you understand my answer rhetoric according to my view is the

ghost or counterfeit of a part of politics




polus and noble or ignoble




socrates ignoble i should say if i am compelled to answer for i call what

is bad ignoble though i doubt whether you understand what i was saying before




gorgias indeed socrates i cannot say that i understand myself




socrates i do not wonder gorgias for i have not as yet explained myself and

our friend polus colt by name and colt by nature is apt to run away this is

an untranslatable play on the name polus which means a

colt




gorgias never mind him but explain to me what you mean by saying that

rhetoric is the counterfeit of a part of politics




socrates i will try then to explain my notion of rhetoric and if i am

mistaken my friend polus shall refute me we may assume the existence of

bodies and of souls




gorgias of course




socrates you would further admit that there is a good condition of either of

them




gorgias yes




socrates which condition may not be really good but good only in appearance

i mean to say that there are many persons who appear to be in good health and

whom only a physician or trainer will discern at first sight not to be in good

health




gorgias true




socrates and this applies not only to the body but also to the soul in

either there may be that which gives the appearance of health and not the

reality




gorgias yes certainly




socrates and now i will endeavour to explain to you more clearly what i mean

the soul and body being two have two arts corresponding to them there is the

art of politics attending on the soul and another art attending on the body

of which i know no single name but which may be described as having two

divisions one of them gymnastic and the other medicine and in politics there

is a legislative part which answers to gymnastic as justice does to medicine

and the two parts run into one another justice having to do with the same

subject as legislation and medicine with the same subject as gymnastic but

with a difference now seeing that there are these four arts two attending on

the body and two on the soul for their highest good flattery knowing or

rather guessing their natures has distributed herself into four shams or

simulations of them she puts on the likeness of some one or other of them and

pretends to be that which she simulates and having no regard for mens

highest interests is ever making pleasure the bait of the unwary and

deceiving them into the belief that she is of the highest value to them

cookery simulates the disguise of medicine and pretends to know what food is

the best for the body and if the physician and the cook had to enter into a

competition in which children were the judges or men who had no more sense

than children as to which of them best understands the goodness or badness of

food the physician would be starved to death a flattery i deem this to be and

of an ignoble sort polus for to you i am now addressing myself because it

aims at pleasure without any thought of the best an art i do not call it but

only an experience because it is unable to explain or to give a reason of the

nature of its own applications and i do not call any irrational thing an art

but if you dispute my words i am prepared to argue in defence of them




cookery then i maintain to be a flattery which takes the form of medicine

and tiring in like manner is a flattery which takes the form of gymnastic

and is knavish false ignoble illiberal working deceitfully by the help of

lines and colours and enamels and garments and making men affect a spurious

beauty to the neglect of the true beauty which is given by gymnastic




i would rather not be tedious and therefore i will only say after the manner

of the geometricians for i think that by this time you will be able to follow




as tiring gymnastic cookery medicine




or rather




as tiring gymnastic sophistry legislation




and




as cookery medicine rhetoric justice




and this i say is the natural difference between the rhetorician and the

sophist but by reason of their near connection they are apt to be jumbled up

together neither do they know what to make of themselves nor do other men

know what to make of them for if the body presided over itself and were not

under the guidance of the soul and the soul did not discern and discriminate

between cookery and medicine but the body was made the judge of them and the

rule of judgment was the bodily delight which was given by them then the word

of anaxagoras that word with which you friend polus are so well acquainted

would prevail far and wide chaos would come again and cookery

health and medicine would mingle in an indiscriminate mass and now i have

told you my notion of rhetoric which is in relation to the soul what cookery

is to the body i may have been inconsistent in making a long speech when i

would not allow you to discourse at length but i think that i may be excused

because you did not understand me and could make no use of my answer when i

spoke shortly and therefore i had to enter into an explanation and if i show

an equal inability to make use of yours i hope that you will speak at equal

length but if i am able to understand you let me have the benefit of your

brevity as is only fair and now you may do what you please with my answer




polus what do you mean do you think that rhetoric is flattery




socrates nay i said a part of flattery if at your age polus you cannot

remember what will you do byandby when you get older




polus and are the good rhetoricians meanly regarded in states under the idea

that they are flatterers




socrates is that a question or the beginning of a speech




polus i am asking a question




socrates then my answer is that they are not regarded at all




polus how not regarded have they not very great power in states




socrates not if you mean to say that power is a good to the possessor




polus and that is what i do mean to say




socrates then if so i think that they have the least power of all the

citizens




polus what are they not like tyrants they kill and despoil and exile any one

whom they please




socrates by the dog polus i cannot make out at each deliverance of yours

whether you are giving an opinion of your own or asking a question of me




polus i am asking a question of you




socrates yes my friend but you ask two questions at once




polus how two questions




socrates why did you not say just now that the rhetoricians are like tyrants

and that they kill and despoil or exile any one whom they please




polus i did




socrates well then i say to you that here are two questions in one and i

will answer both of them and i tell you polus that rhetoricians and tyrants

have the least possible power in states as i was just now saying for they do

literally nothing which they will but only what they think best




polus and is not that a great power




socrates polus has already said the reverse




polus said the reverse nay that is what i assert




socrates no by the greatwhat do you call himnot you for you

say that power is a good to him who has the power




polus i do




socrates and would you maintain that if a fool does what he thinks best this

is a good and would you call this great power




polus i should not




socrates then you must prove that the rhetorician is not a fool and that

rhetoric is an art and not a flatteryand so you will have refuted me

but if you leave me unrefuted why the rhetoricians who do what they think

best in states and the tyrants will have nothing upon which to congratulate

themselves if as you say power be indeed a good admitting at the same time

that what is done without sense is an evil




polus yes i admit that




socrates how then can the rhetoricians or the tyrants have great power in

states unless polus can refute socrates and prove to him that they do as they

will




polus this fellow




socrates i say that they do not do as they willnow refute me




polus why have you not already said that they do as they think best




socrates and i say so still




polus then surely they do as they will




socrates i deny it




polus but they do what they think best




socrates aye




polus that socrates is monstrous and absurd




socrates good words good polus as i may say in your own peculiar style but

if you have any questions to ask of me either prove that i am in error or give

the answer yourself




polus very well i am willing to answer that i may know what you mean




socrates do men appear to you to will that which they do or to will that

further end for the sake of which they do a thing when they take medicine for

example at the bidding of a physician do they will the drinking of the

medicine which is painful or the health for the sake of which they drink




polus clearly the health




socrates and when men go on a voyage or engage in business they do not will

that which they are doing at the time for who would desire to take the risk of

a voyage or the trouble of businessbut they will to have the wealth

for the sake of which they go on a voyage




polus certainly




socrates and is not this universally true if a man does something for the

sake of something else he wills not that which he does but that for the sake

of which he does it




polus yes




socrates and are not all things either good or evil or intermediate and

indifferent




polus to be sure socrates




socrates wisdom and health and wealth and the like you would call goods and

their opposites evils




polus i should




socrates and the things which are neither good nor evil and which partake

sometimes of the nature of good and at other times of evil or of neither are

such as sitting walking running sailing or again wood stones and the

likethese are the things which you call neither good nor evil




polus exactly so




socrates are these indifferent things done for the sake of the good or the

good for the sake of the indifferent




polus clearly the indifferent for the sake of the good




socrates when we walk we walk for the sake of the good and under the idea

that it is better to walk and when we stand we stand equally for the sake of

the good




polus yes




socrates and when we kill a man we kill him or exile him or despoil him of his

goods because as we think it will conduce to our good




polus certainly




socrates men who do any of these things do them for the sake of the good




polus yes




socrates and did we not admit that in doing something for the sake of

something else we do not will those things which we do but that other thing

for the sake of which we do them




polus most true




socrates then we do not will simply to kill a man or to exile him or to

despoil him of his goods but we will to do that which conduces to our good

and if the act is not conducive to our good we do not will it for we will as

you say that which is our good but that which is neither good nor evil or

simply evil we do not will why are you silent polus am i not right




polus you are right




socrates hence we may infer that if any one whether he be a tyrant or a

rhetorician kills another or exiles another or deprives him of his property

under the idea that the act is for his own interests when really not for his

own interests he may be said to do what seems best to him




polus yes




socrates but does he do what he wills if he does what is evil why do you not

answer




polus well i suppose not




socrates then if great power is a good as you allow will such a one have

great power in a state




polus he will not




socrates then i was right in saying that a man may do what seems good to him

in a state and not have great power and not do what he wills




polus as though you socrates would not like to have the power of doing what

seemed good to you in the state rather than not you would not be jealous when

you saw any one killing or despoiling or imprisoning whom he pleased oh no




socrates justly or unjustly do you mean




polus in either case is he not equally to be envied




socrates forbear polus




polus why forbear




socrates because you ought not to envy wretches who are not to be envied but

only to pity them




polus and are those of whom i spoke wretches




socrates yes certainly they are




polus and so you think that he who slays any one whom he pleases and justly

slays him is pitiable and wretched




socrates no i do not say that of him but neither do i think that he is to be

envied




polus were you not saying just now that he is wretched




socrates yes my friend if he killed another unjustly in which case he is

also to be pitied and he is not to be envied if he killed him justly




polus at any rate you will allow that he who is unjustly put to death is

wretched and to be pitied




socrates not so much polus as he who kills him and not so much as he who is

justly killed




polus how can that be socrates




socrates that may very well be inasmuch as doing injustice is the greatest of

evils




polus but is it the greatest is not suffering injustice a greater evil




socrates certainly not




polus then would you rather suffer than do injustice




socrates i should not like either but if i must choose between them i would

rather suffer than do




polus then you would not wish to be a tyrant




socrates not if you mean by tyranny what i mean




polus i mean as i said before the power of doing whatever seems good to you

in a state killing banishing doing in all things as you like




socrates well then illustrious friend when i have said my say do you reply

to me suppose that i go into a crowded agora and take a dagger under my arm

polus i say to you i have just acquired rare power and become a tyrant for

if i think that any of these men whom you see ought to be put to death the man

whom i have a mind to kill is as good as dead and if i am disposed to break

his head or tear his garment he will have his head broken or his garment torn

in an instant such is my great power in this city and if you do not believe

me and i show you the dagger you would probably reply socrates in that sort

of way any one may have great powerhe may burn any house which he

pleases and the docks and triremes of the athenians and all their other

vessels whether public or privatebut can you believe that this mere

doing as you think best is great power




polus certainly not such doing as this




socrates but can you tell me why you disapprove of such a power




polus i can




socrates why then




polus why because he who did as you say would be certain to be punished




socrates and punishment is an evil




polus certainly




socrates and you would admit once more my good sir that great power is a

benefit to a man if his actions turn out to his advantage and that this is the

meaning of great power and if not then his power is an evil and is no power

but let us look at the matter in another waydo we not acknowledge that

the things of which we were speaking the infliction of death and exile and

the deprivation of property are sometimes a good and sometimes not a good




polus certainly




socrates about that you and i may be supposed to agree




polus yes




socrates tell me then when do you say that they are good and when that they

are evilwhat principle do you lay down




polus i would rather socrates that you should answer as well as ask that

question




socrates well polus since you would rather have the answer from me i say

that they are good when they are just and evil when they are unjust




polus you are hard of refutation socrates but might not a child refute that

statement




socrates then i shall be very grateful to the child and equally grateful to

you if you will refute me and deliver me from my foolishness and i hope that

refute me you will and not weary of doing good to a friend




polus yes socrates and i need not go far or appeal to antiquity events

which happened only a few days ago are enough to refute you and to prove that

many men who do wrong are happy




socrates what events




polus you see i presume that archelaus the son of perdiccas is now the ruler

of macedonia




socrates at any rate i hear that he is




polus and do you think that he is happy or miserable




socrates i cannot say polus for i have never had any acquaintance with him




polus and cannot you tell at once and without having an acquaintance with

him whether a man is happy




socrates most certainly not




polus then clearly socrates you would say that you did not even know whether

the great king was a happy man




socrates and i should speak the truth for i do not know how he stands in the

matter of education and justice




polus what and does all happiness consist in this




socrates yes indeed polus that is my doctrine the men and women who are

gentle and good are also happy as i maintain and the unjust and evil are

miserable




polus then according to your doctrine the said archelaus is miserable




socrates yes my friend if he is wicked




polus that he is wicked i cannot deny for he had no title at all to the

throne which he now occupies he being only the son of a woman who was the

slave of alcetas the brother of perdiccas he himself therefore in strict right

was the slave of alcetas and if he had meant to do rightly he would have

remained his slave and then according to your doctrine he would have been

happy but now he is unspeakably miserable for he has been guilty of the

greatest crimes in the first place he invited his uncle and master alcetas

to come to him under the pretence that he would restore to him the throne

which perdiccas has usurped and after entertaining him and his son alexander

who was his own cousin and nearly of an age with him and making them drunk

he threw them into a waggon and carried them off by night and slew them and

got both of them out of the way and when he had done all this wickedness he

never discovered that he was the most miserable of all men and was very far

from repenting shall i tell you how he showed his remorse he had a younger

brother a child of seven years old who was the legitimate son of perdiccas

and to him of right the kingdom belonged archelaus however had no mind to

bring him up as he ought and restore the kingdom to him that was not his

notion of happiness but not long afterwards he threw him into a well and

drowned him and declared to his mother cleopatra that he had fallen in while

running after a goose and had been killed and now as he is the greatest

criminal of all the macedonians he may be supposed to be the most miserable

and not the happiest of them and i dare say that there are many athenians and

you would be at the head of them who would rather be any other macedonian than

archelaus




socrates i praised you at first polus for being a rhetorician rather than a

reasoner and this as i suppose is the sort of argument with which you fancy

that a child might refute me and by which i stand refuted when i say that the

unjust man is not happy but my good friend where is the refutation i cannot

admit a word which you have been saying




polus that is because you will not for you surely must think as i do




socrates not so my simple friend but because you will refute me after the

manner which rhetoricians practise in courts of law for there the one party

think that they refute the other when they bring forward a number of witnesses

of good repute in proof of their allegations and their adversary has only a

single one or none at all but this kind of proof is of no value where truth is

the aim a man may often be sworn down by a multitude of false witnesses who

have a great air of respectability and in this argument nearly every one

athenian and stranger alike would be on your side if you should bring

witnesses in disproof of my statementyou may if you will summon

nicias the son of niceratus and let his brothers who gave the row of tripods

which stand in the precincts of dionysus come with him or you may summon

aristocrates the son of scellius who is the giver of that famous offering

which is at delphi summon if you will the whole house of pericles or any

other great athenian family whom you choosethey will all agree with

you i only am left alone and cannot agree for you do not convince me

although you produce many false witnesses against me in the hope of depriving

me of my inheritance which is the truth but i consider that nothing worth

speaking of will have been effected by me unless i make you the one witness of

my words nor by you unless you make me the one witness of yours no matter

about the rest of the world for there are two ways of refutation one which is

yours and that of the world in general but mine is of another sortlet

us compare them and see in what they differ for indeed we are at issue

about matters which to know is honourable and not to know disgraceful to know

or not to know happiness and miserythat is the chief of them and what

knowledge can be nobler or what ignorance more disgraceful than this and

therefore i will begin by asking you whether you do not think that a man who is

unjust and doing injustice can be happy seeing that you think archelaus

unjust and yet happy may i assume this to be your opinion




polus certainly




socrates but i say that this is an impossibilityhere is one point about

which we are at issuevery good and do you mean to say also that if he

meets with retribution and punishment he will still be happy




polus certainly not in that case he will be most miserable




socrates on the other hand if the unjust be not punished then according to

you he will be happy




polus yes




socrates but in my opinion polus the unjust or doer of unjust actions is

miserable in any casemore miserable however if he be not punished and

does not meet with retribution and less miserable if he be punished and meets

with retribution at the hands of gods and men




polus you are maintaining a strange doctrine socrates




socrates i shall try to make you agree with me o my friend for as a friend i

regard you then these are the points at issue between usare they not i

was saying that to do is worse than to suffer injustice




polus exactly so




socrates and you said the opposite




polus yes




socrates i said also that the wicked are miserable and you refuted me




polus by zeus i did




socrates in your own opinion polus




polus yes and i rather suspect that i was in the right




socrates you further said that the wrongdoer is happy if he be unpunished




polus certainly




socrates and i affirm that he is most miserable and that those who are

punished are less miserableare you going to refute this proposition

also




polus a proposition which is harder of refutation than the other socrates




socrates say rather polus impossible for who can refute the truth




polus what do you mean if a man is detected in an unjust attempt to make

himself a tyrant and when detected is racked mutilated has his eyes burned

out and after having had all sorts of great injuries inflicted on him and

having seen his wife and children suffer the like is at last impaled or tarred

and burned alive will he be happier than if he escape and become a tyrant and

continue all through life doing what he likes and holding the reins of

government the envy and admiration both of citizens and strangers is that the

paradox which as you say cannot be refuted




socrates there again noble polus you are raising hobgoblins instead of

refuting me just now you were calling witnesses against me but please to

refresh my memory a little did you sayin an unjust attempt to

make himself a tyrant




polus yes i did




socrates then i say that neither of them will be happier than the

otherneither he who unjustly acquires a tyranny nor he who suffers in

the attempt for of two miserables one cannot be the happier but that he who

escapes and becomes a tyrant is the more miserable of the two do you laugh

polus well this is a new kind of refutationwhen any one says

anything instead of refuting him to laugh at him




polus but do you not think socrates that you have been sufficiently refuted

when you say that which no human being will allow ask the company




socrates o polus i am not a public man and only last year when my tribe

were serving as prytanes and it became my duty as their president to take the

votes there was a laugh at me because i was unable to take them and as i

failed then you must not ask me to count the suffrages of the company now but

if as i was saying you have no better argument than numbers let me have a

turn and do you make trial of the sort of proof which as i think is

required for i shall produce one witness only of the truth of my words and he

is the person with whom i am arguing his suffrage i know how to take but with

the many i have nothing to do and do not even address myself to them may i

ask then whether you will answer in turn and have your words put to the proof

for i certainly think that i and you and every man do really believe that to

do is a greater evil than to suffer injustice and not to be punished than to

be punished




polus and i should say neither i nor any man would you yourself for

example suffer rather than do injustice




socrates yes and you too i or any man would




polus quite the reverse neither you nor i nor any man




socrates but will you answer




polus to be sure i will for i am curious to hear what you can have to say




socrates tell me then and you will know and let us suppose that i am

beginning at the beginning which of the two polus in your opinion is the

worstto do injustice or to suffer




polus i should say that suffering was worst




socrates and which is the greater disgraceanswer




polus to do




socrates and the greater disgrace is the greater evil




polus certainly not




socrates i understand you to say if i am not mistaken that the honourable is

not the same as the good or the disgraceful as the evil




polus certainly not




socrates let me ask a question of you when you speak of beautiful things

such as bodies colours figures sounds institutions do you not call them

beautiful in reference to some standard bodies for example are beautiful in

proportion as they are useful or as the sight of them gives pleasure to the

spectators can you give any other account of personal beauty




polus i cannot




socrates and you would say of figures or colours generally that they were

beautiful either by reason of the pleasure which they give or of their use

or of both




polus yes i should




socrates and you would call sounds and music beautiful for the same reason




polus i should




socrates laws and institutions also have no beauty in them except in so far as

they are useful or pleasant or both




polus i think not




socrates and may not the same be said of the beauty of knowledge




polus to be sure socrates and i very much approve of your measuring beauty

by the standard of pleasure and utility




socrates and deformity or disgrace may be equally measured by the opposite

standard of pain and evil




polus certainly




socrates then when of two beautiful things one exceeds in beauty the measure

of the excess is to be taken in one or both of these that is to say in

pleasure or utility or both




polus very true




socrates and of two deformed things that which exceeds in deformity or

disgrace exceeds either in pain or evilmust it not be so




polus yes




socrates but then again what was the observation which you just now made

about doing and suffering wrong did you not say that suffering wrong was more

evil and doing wrong more disgraceful




polus i did




socrates then if doing wrong is more disgraceful than suffering the more

disgraceful must be more painful and must exceed in pain or in evil or both

does not that also follow




polus of course




socrates first then let us consider whether the doing of injustice exceeds

the suffering in the consequent pain do the injurers suffer more than the

injured




polus no socrates certainly not




socrates then they do not exceed in pain




polus no




socrates but if not in pain then not in both




polus certainly not




socrates then they can only exceed in the other




polus yes




socrates that is to say in evil




polus true




socrates then doing injustice will have an excess of evil and will therefore

be a greater evil than suffering injustice




polus clearly




socrates but have not you and the world already agreed that to do injustice is

more disgraceful than to suffer




polus yes




socrates and that is now discovered to be more evil




polus true




socrates and would you prefer a greater evil or a greater dishonour to a less

one answer polus and fear not for you will come to no harm if you nobly

resign yourself into the healing hand of the argument as to a physician without

shrinking and either say yes or no to me




polus i should say no




socrates would any other man prefer a greater to a less evil




polus no not according to this way of putting the case socrates




socrates then i said truly polus that neither you nor i nor any man would

rather do than suffer injustice for to do injustice is the greater evil of the

two




polus that is the conclusion




socrates you see polus when you compare the two kinds of refutations how

unlike they are all men with the exception of myself are of your way of

thinking but your single assent and witness are enough for mei have no

need of any other i take your suffrage and am regardless of the rest enough

of this and now let us proceed to the next question which is whether the

greatest of evils to a guilty man is to suffer punishment as you supposed or

whether to escape punishment is not a greater evil as i supposed

consideryou would say that to suffer punishment is another name for

being justly corrected when you do wrong




polus i should




socrates and would you not allow that all just things are honourable in so far

as they are just please to reflect and tell me your opinion




polus yes socrates i think that they are




socrates consider againwhere there is an agent must there not also be

a patient




polus i should say so




socrates and will not the patient suffer that which the agent does and will

not the suffering have the quality of the action i mean for example that if

a man strikes there must be something which is stricken




polus yes




socrates and if the striker strikes violently or quickly that which is struck

will be struck violently or quickly




polus true




socrates and the suffering to him who is stricken is of the same nature as the

act of him who strikes




polus yes




socrates and if a man burns there is something which is burned




polus certainly




socrates and if he burns in excess or so as to cause pain the thing burned

will be burned in the same way




polus truly




socrates and if he cuts the same argument holdsthere will be something

cut




polus yes




socrates and if the cutting be great or deep or such as will cause pain the

cut will be of the same nature




polus that is evident




socrates then you would agree generally to the universal proposition which i

was just now asserting that the affection of the patient answers to the

affection of the agent




polus i agree




socrates then as this is admitted let me ask whether being punished is

suffering or acting




polus suffering socrates there can be no doubt of that




socrates and suffering implies an agent




polus certainly socrates and he is the punisher




socrates and he who punishes rightly punishes justly




polus yes




socrates and therefore he acts justly




polus justly




socrates then he who is punished and suffers retribution suffers justly




polus that is evident




socrates and that which is just has been admitted to be honourable




polus certainly




socrates then the punisher does what is honourable and the punished suffers

what is honourable




polus true




socrates and if what is honourable then what is good for the honourable is

either pleasant or useful




polus certainly




socrates then he who is punished suffers what is good




polus that is true




socrates then he is benefited




polus yes




socrates do i understand you to mean what i mean by the term

benefited i mean that if he be justly punished his soul is

improved




polus surely




socrates then he who is punished is delivered from the evil of his soul




polus yes




socrates and is he not then delivered from the greatest evil look at the

matter in this wayin respect of a mans estate do you see any

greater evil than poverty




polus there is no greater evil




socrates again in a mans bodily frame you would say that the evil is

weakness and disease and deformity




polus i should




socrates and do you not imagine that the soul likewise has some evil of her

own




polus of course




socrates and this you would call injustice and ignorance and cowardice and

the like




polus certainly




socrates so then in mind body and estate which are three you have pointed

out three corresponding evilsinjustice disease poverty




polus true




socrates and which of the evils is the most disgracefulis not the most

disgraceful of them injustice and in general the evil of the soul




polus by far the most




socrates and if the most disgraceful then also the worst




polus what do you mean socrates




socrates i mean to say that is most disgraceful has been already admitted to

be most painful or hurtful or both




polus certainly




socrates and now injustice and all evil in the soul has been admitted by us to

be most disgraceful




polus it has been admitted




socrates and most disgraceful either because most painful and causing

excessive pain or most hurtful or both




polus certainly




socrates and therefore to be unjust and intemperate and cowardly and

ignorant is more painful than to be poor and sick




polus nay socrates the painfulness does not appear to me to follow from your

premises




socrates then if as you would argue not more painful the evil of the soul

is of all evils the most disgraceful and the excess of disgrace must be caused

by some preternatural greatness or extraordinary hurtfulness of the evil




polus clearly




socrates and that which exceeds most in hurtfulness will be the greatest of

evils




polus yes




socrates then injustice and intemperance and in general the depravity of the

soul are the greatest of evils




polus that is evident




socrates now what art is there which delivers us from poverty does not the

art of making money




polus yes




socrates and what art frees us from disease does not the art of medicine




polus very true




socrates and what from vice and injustice if you are not able to answer at

once ask yourself whither we go with the sick and to whom we take them




polus to the physicians socrates




socrates and to whom do we go with the unjust and intemperate




polus to the judges you mean




socrates who are to punish them




polus yes




socrates and do not those who rightly punish others punish them in accordance

with a certain rule of justice




polus clearly




socrates then the art of moneymaking frees a man from poverty medicine from

disease and justice from intemperance and injustice




polus that is evident




socrates which then is the best of these three




polus will you enumerate them




socrates moneymaking medicine and justice




polus justice socrates far excels the two others




socrates and justice if the best gives the greatest pleasure or advantage or

both




polus yes




socrates but is the being healed a pleasant thing and are those who are being

healed pleased




polus i think not




socrates a useful thing then




polus yes




socrates yes because the patient is delivered from a great evil and this is

the advantage of enduring the painthat you get well




polus certainly




socrates and would he be the happier man in his bodily condition who is

healed or who never was out of health




polus clearly he who was never out of health




socrates yes for happiness surely does not consist in being delivered from

evils but in never having had them




polus true




socrates and suppose the case of two persons who have some evil in their

bodies and that one of them is healed and delivered from evil and another is

not healed but retains the evilwhich of them is the most miserable




polus clearly he who is not healed




socrates and was not punishment said by us to be a deliverance from the

greatest of evils which is vice




polus true




socrates and justice punishes us and makes us more just and is the medicine

of our vice




polus true




socrates he then has the first place in the scale of happiness who has never

had vice in his soul for this has been shown to be the greatest of evils




polus clearly




socrates and he has the second place who is delivered from vice




polus true




socrates that is to say he who receives admonition and rebuke and punishment




polus yes




socrates then he lives worst who having been unjust has no deliverance from

injustice




polus certainly




socrates that is he lives worst who commits the greatest crimes and who

being the most unjust of men succeeds in escaping rebuke or correction or

punishment and this as you say has been accomplished by archelaus and other

tyrants and rhetoricians and potentates compare republic




polus true




socrates may not their way of proceeding my friend be compared to the

conduct of a person who is afflicted with the worst of diseases and yet

contrives not to pay the penalty to the physician for his sins against his

constitution and will not be cured because like a child he is afraid of the

pain of being burned or cutis not that a parallel case




polus yes truly




socrates he would seem as if he did not know the nature of health and bodily

vigour and if we are right polus in our previous conclusions they are in a

like case who strive to evade justice which they see to be painful but are

blind to the advantage which ensues from it not knowing how far more miserable

a companion a diseased soul is than a diseased body a soul i say which is

corrupt and unrighteous and unholy and hence they do all that they can to

avoid punishment and to avoid being released from the greatest of evils they

provide themselves with money and friends and cultivate to the utmost their

powers of persuasion but if we polus are right do you see what follows or

shall we draw out the consequences in form




polus if you please




socrates is it not a fact that injustice and the doing of injustice is the

greatest of evils




polus that is quite clear




socrates and further that to suffer punishment is the way to be released from

this evil




polus true




socrates and not to suffer is to perpetuate the evil




polus yes




socrates to do wrong then is second only in the scale of evils but to do

wrong and not to be punished is first and greatest of all




polus that is true




socrates well and was not this the point in dispute my friend you deemed

archelaus happy because he was a very great criminal and unpunished i on the

other hand maintained that he or any other who like him has done wrong and has

not been punished is and ought to be the most miserable of all men and that

the doer of injustice is more miserable than the sufferer and he who escapes

punishment more miserable than he who sufferswas not that what i said




polus yes




socrates and it has been proved to be true




polus certainly




socrates well polus but if this is true where is the great use of rhetoric

if we admit what has been just now said every man ought in every way to guard

himself against doing wrong for he will thereby suffer great evil




polus true




socrates and if he or any one about whom he cares does wrong he ought of

his own accord to go where he will be immediately punished he will run to the

judge as he would to the physician in order that the disease of injustice may

not be rendered chronic and become the incurable cancer of the soul must we

not allow this consequence polus if our former admissions are to

standis any other inference consistent with them




polus to that socrates there can be but one answer




socrates then rhetoric is of no use to us polus in helping a man to excuse

his own injustice that of his parents or friends or children or country but

may be of use to any one who holds that instead of excusing he ought to

accusehimself above all and in the next degree his family or any of his

friends who may be doing wrong he should bring to light the iniquity and not

conceal it that so the wrongdoer may suffer and be made whole and he should

even force himself and others not to shrink but with closed eyes like brave

men to let the physician operate with knife or searing iron not regarding the

pain in the hope of attaining the good and the honourable let him who has

done things worthy of stripes allow himself to be scourged if of bonds to be

bound if of a fine to be fined if of exile to be exiled if of death to

die himself being the first to accuse himself and his own relations and using

rhetoric to this end that his and their unjust actions may be made manifest

and that they themselves may be delivered from injustice which is the greatest

evil then polus rhetoric would indeed be useful do you say

yes or no to that




polus to me socrates what you are saying appears very strange though

probably in agreement with your premises




socrates is not this the conclusion if the premises are not disproven




polus yes it certainly is




socrates and from the opposite point of view if indeed it be our duty to harm

another whether an enemy or noti except the case of

selfdefencethen i have to be upon my guardbut if my enemy

injures a third person then in every sort of way by word as well as deed i

should try to prevent his being punished or appearing before the judge and if

he appears i should contrive that he should escape and not suffer punishment

if he has stolen a sum of money let him keep what he has stolen and spend it

on him and his regardless of religion and justice and if he have done things

worthy of death let him not die but rather be immortal in his wickedness or

if this is not possible let him at any rate be allowed to live as long as he

can for such purposes polus rhetoric may be useful but is of small if of

any use to him who is not intending to commit injustice at least there was no

such use discovered by us in the previous discussion




callicles tell me chaerephon is socrates in earnest or is he joking




chaerephon i should say callicles that he is in most profound earnest but

you may well ask him




callicles by the gods and i will tell me socrates are you in earnest or

only in jest for if you are in earnest and what you say is true is not the

whole of human life turned upside down and are we not doing as would appear

in everything the opposite of what we ought to be doing




socrates o callicles if there were not some community of feelings among

mankind however varying in different personsi mean to say if every

mans feelings were peculiar to himself and were not shared by the rest

of his speciesi do not see how we could ever communicate our impressions

to one another i make this remark because i perceive that you and i have a

common feeling for we are lovers both and both of us have two loves

apiecei am the lover of alcibiades the son of cleinias and of

philosophy and you of the athenian demus and of demus the son of pyrilampes

now i observe that you with all your cleverness do not venture to contradict

your favourite in any word or opinion of his but as he changes you change

backwards and forwards when the athenian demus denies anything that you are

saying in the assembly you go over to his opinion and you do the same with

demus the fair young son of pyrilampes for you have not the power to resist

the words and ideas of your loves and if a person were to express surprise at

the strangeness of what you say from time to time when under their influence

you would probably reply to him if you were honest that you cannot help

saying what your loves say unless they are prevented and that you can only be

silent when they are now you must understand that my words are an echo too

and therefore you need not wonder at me but if you want to silence me silence

philosophy who is my love for she is always telling me what i am now telling

you my friend neither is she capricious like my other love for the son of

cleinias says one thing today and another thing tomorrow but philosophy is

always true she is the teacher at whose words you are now wondering and you

have heard her yourself her you must refute and either show as i was saying

that to do injustice and to escape punishment is not the worst of all evils

or if you leave her word unrefuted by the dog the god of egypt i declare o

callicles that callicles will never be at one with himself but that his whole

life will be a discord and yet my friend i would rather that my lyre should

be inharmonious and that there should be no music in the chorus which i

provided aye or that the whole world should be at odds with me and oppose

me rather than that i myself should be at odds with myself and contradict

myself




callicles o socrates you are a regular declaimer and seem to be running riot

in the argument and now you are declaiming in this way because polus has

fallen into the same error himself of which he accused gorgiasfor he

said that when gorgias was asked by you whether if some one came to him who

wanted to learn rhetoric and did not know justice he would teach him justice

gorgias in his modesty replied that he would because he thought that mankind

in general would be displeased if he answered no and then in

consequence of this admission gorgias was compelled to contradict himself

that being just the sort of thing in which you delight whereupon polus laughed

at you deservedly as i think but now he has himself fallen into the same

trap i cannot say very much for his wit when he conceded to you that to do is

more dishonourable than to suffer injustice for this was the admission which

led to his being entangled by you and because he was too modest to say what he

thought he had his mouth stopped for the truth is socrates that you who

pretend to be engaged in the pursuit of truth are appealing now to the popular

and vulgar notions of right which are not natural but only conventional

convention and nature are generally at variance with one another and hence if

a person is too modest to say what he thinks he is compelled to contradict

himself and you in your ingenuity perceiving the advantage to be thereby

gained slyly ask of him who is arguing conventionally a question which is to

be determined by the rule of nature and if he is talking of the rule of

nature you slip away to custom as for instance you did in this very

discussion about doing and suffering injustice when polus was speaking of the

conventionally dishonourable you assailed him from the point of view of

nature for by the rule of nature to suffer injustice is the greater disgrace

because the greater evil but conventionally to do evil is the more

disgraceful for the suffering of injustice is not the part of a man but of a

slave who indeed had better die than live since when he is wronged and

trampled upon he is unable to help himself or any other about whom he cares

the reason as i conceive is that the makers of laws are the majority who are

weak and they make laws and distribute praises and censures with a view to

themselves and to their own interests and they terrify the stronger sort of

men and those who are able to get the better of them in order that they may

not get the better of them and they say that dishonesty is shameful and

unjust meaning by the word injustice the desire of a man to have more than

his neighbours for knowing their own inferiority i suspect that they are too

glad of equality and therefore the endeavour to have more than the many is

conventionally said to be shameful and unjust and is called injustice compare

republic whereas nature herself intimates that it is just for the better to

have more than the worse the more powerful than the weaker and in many ways

she shows among men as well as among animals and indeed among whole cities

and races that justice consists in the superior ruling over and having more

than the inferior for on what principle of justice did xerxes invade hellas

or his father the scythians not to speak of numberless other examples nay

but these are the men who act according to nature yes by heaven and

according to the law of nature not perhaps according to that artificial law

which we invent and impose upon our fellows of whom we take the best and

strongest from their youth upwards and tame them like young

lionscharming them with the sound of the voice and saying to them

that with equality they must be content and that the equal is the honourable

and the just but if there were a man who had sufficient force he would shake

off and break through and escape from all this he would trample under foot

all our formulas and spells and charms and all our laws which are against

nature the slave would rise in rebellion and be lord over us and the light of

natural justice would shine forth and this i take to be the sentiment of

pindar when he says in his poem that




law is the king of all of mortals as well as of immortals




this as he says




makes might to be right doing violence with highest hand as i infer

from the deeds of heracles for without buying them fragm

incert  bockh i do not remember the exact words but the meaning

is that without buying them and without their being given to him he carried

off the oxen of geryon according to the law of natural right and that the

oxen and other possessions of the weaker and inferior properly belong to the

stronger and superior and this is true as you may ascertain if you will

leave philosophy and go on to higher things for philosophy socrates if

pursued in moderation and at the proper age is an elegant accomplishment but

too much philosophy is the ruin of human life even if a man has good parts

still if he carries philosophy into later life he is necessarily ignorant of

all those things which a gentleman and a person of honour ought to know he is

inexperienced in the laws of the state and in the language which ought to be

used in the dealings of man with man whether private or public and utterly

ignorant of the pleasures and desires of mankind and of human character in

general and people of this sort when they betake themselves to politics or

business are as ridiculous as i imagine the politicians to be when they make

their appearance in the arena of philosophy for as euripides says




every man shines in that and pursues that and devotes the greatest

portion of the day to that in which he most excels antiope fragm 

dindorf




but anything in which he is inferior he avoids and depreciates and praises

the opposite from partiality to himself and because he thinks that he will

thus praise himself the true principle is to unite them philosophy as a part

of education is an excellent thing and there is no disgrace to a man while he

is young in pursuing such a study but when he is more advanced in years the

thing becomes ridiculous and i feel towards philosophers as i do towards those

who lisp and imitate children for i love to see a little child who is not of

an age to speak plainly lisping at his play there is an appearance of grace

and freedom in his utterance which is natural to his childish years but when

i hear some small creature carefully articulating its words i am offended the

sound is disagreeable and has to my ears the twang of slavery so when i hear

a man lisping or see him playing like a child his behaviour appears to me

ridiculous and unmanly and worthy of stripes and i have the same feeling about

students of philosophy when i see a youth thus engagedthe study

appears to me to be in character and becoming a man of liberal education and

him who neglects philosophy i regard as an inferior man who will never aspire

to anything great or noble but if i see him continuing the study in later

life and not leaving off i should like to beat him socrates for as i was

saying such a one even though he have good natural parts becomes effeminate

he flies from the busy centre and the marketplace in which as the poet says

men become distinguished he creeps into a corner for the rest of his life and

talks in a whisper with three or four admiring youths but never speaks out

like a freeman in a satisfactory manner now i socrates am very well inclined

towards you and my feeling may be compared with that of zethus towards

amphion in the play of euripides whom i was mentioning just now for i am

disposed to say to you much what zethus said to his brother that you

socrates are careless about the things of which you ought to be careful and

that you




who have a soul so noble are remarkable for a puerile exterior neither

in a court of justice could you state a case or give any reason or proof or

offer valiant counsel on anothers behalf




and you must not be offended my dear socrates for i am speaking out of

goodwill towards you if i ask whether you are not ashamed of being thus

defenceless which i affirm to be the condition not of you only but of all

those who will carry the study of philosophy too far for suppose that some one

were to take you or any one of your sort off to prison declaring that you

had done wrong when you had done no wrong you must allow that you would not

know what to dothere you would stand giddy and gaping and not having a

word to say and when you went up before the court even if the accuser were a

poor creature and not good for much you would die if he were disposed to claim

the penalty of death and yet socrates what is the value of




an art which converts a man of sense into a fool




who is helpless and has no power to save either himself or others when he is

in the greatest danger and is going to be despoiled by his enemies of all his

goods and has to live simply deprived of his rights of citizenshiphe

being a man who if i may use the expression may be boxed on the ears with

impunity then my good friend take my advice and refute no more




learn the philosophy of business and acquire the reputation of wisdom

but leave to others these niceties




whether they are to be described as follies or absurdities




for they will only give you poverty for the inmate of your

dwelling




cease then emulating these paltry splitters of words and emulate only the

man of substance and honour who is well to do




socrates if my soul callicles were made of gold should i not rejoice to

discover one of those stones with which they test gold and the very best

possible one to which i might bring my soul and if the stone and i agreed in

approving of her training then i should know that i was in a satisfactory

state and that no other test was needed by me




callicles what is your meaning socrates




socrates i will tell you i think that i have found in you the desired

touchstone




callicles why




socrates because i am sure that if you agree with me in any of the opinions

which my soul forms i have at last found the truth indeed for i consider that

if a man is to make a complete trial of the good or evil of the soul he ought

to have three qualitiesknowledge goodwill outspokenness which are

all possessed by you many whom i meet are unable to make trial of me because

they are not wise as you are others are wise but they will not tell me the

truth because they have not the same interest in me which you have and these

two strangers gorgias and polus are undoubtedly wise men and my very good

friends but they are not outspoken enough and they are too modest why their

modesty is so great that they are driven to contradict themselves first one

and then the other of them in the face of a large company on matters of the

highest moment but you have all the qualities in which these others are

deficient having received an excellent education to this many athenians can

testify and you are my friend shall i tell you why i think so i know that

you callicles and tisander of aphidnae and andron the son of androtion and

nausicydes of the deme of cholarges studied together there were four of you

and i once heard you advising with one another as to the extent to which the

pursuit of philosophy should be carried and as i know you came to the

conclusion that the study should not be pushed too much into detail you were

cautioning one another not to be overwise you were afraid that too much wisdom

might unconsciously to yourselves be the ruin of you and now when i hear you

giving the same advice to me which you then gave to your most intimate friends

i have a sufficient evidence of your real goodwill to me and of the frankness

of your nature and freedom from modesty i am assured by yourself and the

assurance is confirmed by your last speech well then the inference in the

present case clearly is that if you agree with me in an argument about any

point that point will have been sufficiently tested by us and will not

require to be submitted to any further test for you could not have agreed with

me either from lack of knowledge or from superfluity of modesty nor yet from

a desire to deceive me for you are my friend as you tell me yourself and

therefore when you and i are agreed the result will be the attainment of

perfect truth now there is no nobler enquiry callicles than that which you

censure me for makingwhat ought the character of a man to be and what

his pursuits and how far is he to go both in maturer years and in youth for

be assured that if i err in my own conduct i do not err intentionally but from

ignorance do not then desist from advising me now that you have begun until

i have learned clearly what this is which i am to practise and how i may

acquire it and if you find me assenting to your words and hereafter not doing

that to which i assented call me dolt and deem me unworthy of

receiving further instruction once more then tell me what you and pindar

mean by natural justice do you not mean that the superior should take the

property of the inferior by force that the better should rule the worse the

noble have more than the mean am i not right in my recollection




callicles yes that is what i was saying and so i still aver




socrates and do you mean by the better the same as the superior for i could

not make out what you were saying at the timewhether you meant by the

superior the stronger and that the weaker must obey the stronger as you

seemed to imply when you said that great cities attack small ones in accordance

with natural right because they are superior and stronger as though the

superior and stronger and better were the same or whether the better may be

also the inferior and weaker and the superior the worse or whether better is

to be defined in the same way as superiorthis is the point which i want

to have cleared up are the superior and better and stronger the same or

different




callicles i say unequivocally that they are the same




socrates then the many are by nature superior to the one against whom as you

were saying they make the laws




callicles certainly




socrates then the laws of the many are the laws of the superior




callicles very true




socrates then they are the laws of the better for the superior class are far

better as you were saying




callicles yes




socrates and since they are superior the laws which are made by them are by

nature good




callicles yes




socrates and are not the many of opinion as you were lately saying that

justice is equality and that to do is more disgraceful than to suffer

injusticeis that so or not answer callicles and let no modesty be

found to come in the way do the many think or do they not think thusi

must beg of you to answer in order that if you agree with me i may fortify

myself by the assent of so competent an authority




callicles yes the opinion of the many is what you say




socrates then not only custom but nature also affirms that to do is more

disgraceful than to suffer injustice and that justice is equality so that you

seem to have been wrong in your former assertion when accusing me you said

that nature and custom are opposed and that i knowing this was dishonestly

playing between them appealing to custom when the argument is about nature

and to nature when the argument is about custom




callicles this man will never cease talking nonsense at your age socrates

are you not ashamed to be catching at words and chuckling over some verbal

slip do you not seehave i not told you already that by superior i mean

better do you imagine me to say that if a rabble of slaves and nondescripts

who are of no use except perhaps for their physical strength get together

their ipsissima verba are laws




socrates ho my philosopher is that your line




callicles certainly




socrates i was thinking callicles that something of the kind must have been

in your mind and that is why i repeated the questionwhat is the

superior i wanted to know clearly what you meant for you surely do not think

that two men are better than one or that your slaves are better than you

because they are stronger then please to begin again and tell me who the

better are if they are not the stronger and i will ask you great sir to be

a little milder in your instructions or i shall have to run away from you




callicles you are ironical




socrates no by the hero zethus callicles by whose aid you were just now

saying many ironical things against me i am nottell me then whom you

mean by the better




callicles i mean the more excellent




socrates do you not see that you are yourself using words which have no

meaning and that you are explaining nothingwill you tell me whether you

mean by the better and superior the wiser or if not whom




callicles most assuredly i do mean the wiser




socrates then according to you one wise man may often be superior to ten

thousand fools and he ought to rule them and they ought to be his subjects

and he ought to have more than they should this is what i believe that you

mean and you must not suppose that i am wordcatching if you allow that the

one is superior to the ten thousand




callicles yes that is what i mean and that is what i conceive to be natural

justicethat the better and wiser should rule and have more than the

inferior




socrates stop there and let me ask you what you would say in this case let

us suppose that we are all together as we are now there are several of us and

we have a large common store of meats and drinks and there are all sorts of

persons in our company having various degrees of strength and weakness and one

of us being a physician is wiser in the matter of food than all the rest and

he is probably stronger than some and not so strong as others of uswill

he not being wiser be also better than we are and our superior in this

matter of food




callicles certainly




socrates either then he will have a larger share of the meats and drinks

because he is better or he will have the distribution of all of them by reason

of his authority but he will not expend or make use of a larger share of them

on his own person or if he does he will be punishedhis share will

exceed that of some and be less than that of others and if he be the weakest

of all he being the best of all will have the smallest share of all

calliclesam i not right my friend




callicles you talk about meats and drinks and physicians and other nonsense i

am not speaking of them




socrates well but do you admit that the wiser is the better answer

yes or no




callicles yes




socrates and ought not the better to have a larger share




callicles not of meats and drinks




socrates i understand then perhaps of coatsthe skilfullest weaver

ought to have the largest coat and the greatest number of them and go about

clothed in the best and finest of them




callicles fudge about coats




socrates then the skilfullest and best in making shoes ought to have the

advantage in shoes the shoemaker clearly should walk about in the largest

shoes and have the greatest number of them




callicles fudge about shoes what nonsense are you talking




socrates or if this is not your meaning perhaps you would say that the wise

and good and true husbandman should actually have a larger share of seeds and

have as much seed as possible for his own land




callicles how you go on always talking in the same way socrates




socrates yes callicles and also about the same things




callicles yes by the gods you are literally always talking of cobblers and

fullers and cooks and doctors as if this had to do with our argument




socrates but why will you not tell me in what a man must be superior and wiser

in order to claim a larger share will you neither accept a suggestion nor

offer one




callicles i have already told you in the first place i mean by superiors not

cobblers or cooks but wise politicians who understand the administration of a

state and who are not only wise but also valiant and able to carry out their

designs and not the men to faint from want of soul




socrates see now most excellent callicles how different my charge against

you is from that which you bring against me for you reproach me with always

saying the same but i reproach you with never saying the same about the same

things for at one time you were defining the better and the superior to be the

stronger then again as the wiser and now you bring forward a new notion the

superior and the better are now declared by you to be the more courageous i

wish my good friend that you would tell me once for all whom you affirm to

be the better and superior and in what they are better




callicles i have already told you that i mean those who are wise and

courageous in the administration of a statethey ought to be the rulers

of their states and justice consists in their having more than their subjects




socrates but whether rulers or subjects will they or will they not have more

than themselves my friend




callicles what do you mean




socrates i mean that every man is his own ruler but perhaps you think that

there is no necessity for him to rule himself he is only required to rule

others




callicles what do you mean by his ruling over himself




socrates a simple thing enough just what is commonly said that a man should

be temperate and master of himself and ruler of his own pleasures and

passions




callicles what innocence you mean those foolsthe temperate




socrates certainlyany one may know that to be my meaning




callicles quite so socrates and they are really fools for how can a man be

happy who is the servant of anything on the contrary i plainly assert that

he who would truly live ought to allow his desires to wax to the uttermost and

not to chastise them but when they have grown to their greatest he should have

courage and intelligence to minister to them and to satisfy all his longings

and this i affirm to be natural justice and nobility to this however the many

cannot attain and they blame the strong man because they are ashamed of their

own weakness which they desire to conceal and hence they say that

intemperance is base as i have remarked already they enslave the nobler

natures and being unable to satisfy their pleasures they praise temperance

and justice out of their own cowardice for if a man had been originally the

son of a king or had a nature capable of acquiring an empire or a tyranny or

sovereignty what could be more truly base or evil than temperanceto a

man like him i say who might freely be enjoying every good and has no one to

stand in his way and yet has admitted custom and reason and the opinion of

other men to be lords over himmust not he be in a miserable plight whom

the reputation of justice and temperance hinders from giving more to his

friends than to his enemies even though he be a ruler in his city nay

socrates for you profess to be a votary of the truth and the truth is

thisthat luxury and intemperance and licence if they be provided with

means are virtue and happinessall the rest is a mere bauble agreements

contrary to nature foolish talk of men nothing worth compare republic




socrates there is a noble freedom callicles in your way of approaching the

argument for what you say is what the rest of the world think but do not like

to say and i must beg of you to persevere that the true rule of human life

may become manifest tell me thenyou say do you not that in the

rightlydeveloped man the passions ought not to be controlled but that we

should let them grow to the utmost and somehow or other satisfy them and that

this is virtue




callicles yes i do




socrates then those who want nothing are not truly said to be happy




callicles no indeed for then stones and dead men would be the happiest of

all




socrates but surely life according to your view is an awful thing and indeed

i think that euripides may have been right in saying




who knows if life be not death and death life




and that we are very likely dead i have heard a philosopher say that at this

moment we are actually dead and that the body soma is our tomb sema

compare phaedr and that the part of the soul which is the seat of the

desires is liable to be tossed about by words and blown up and down and some

ingenious person probably a sicilian or an italian playing with the word

invented a tale in which he called the soulbecause of its believing and

makebelieve naturea vessel an untranslatable pundia to

pithanon te kai pistikon onomase pithon and the ignorant he called the

uninitiated or leaky and the place in the souls of the uninitiated in which

the desires are seated being the intemperate and incontinent part he compared

to a vessel full of holes because it can never be satisfied he is not of your

way of thinking callicles for he declares that of all the souls in hades

meaning the invisible world aeides these uninitiated or leaky persons are

the most miserable and that they pour water into a vessel which is full of

holes out of a colander which is similarly perforated the colander as my

informer assures me is the soul and the soul which he compares to a colander

is the soul of the ignorant which is likewise full of holes and therefore

incontinent owing to a bad memory and want of faith these notions are strange

enough but they show the principle which if i can i would fain prove to you

that you should change your mind and instead of the intemperate and insatiate

life choose that which is orderly and sufficient and has a due provision for

daily needs do i make any impression on you and are you coming over to the

opinion that the orderly are happier than the intemperate or do i fail to

persuade you and however many tales i rehearse to you do you continue of the

same opinion still




callicles the latter socrates is more like the truth




socrates well i will tell you another image which comes out of the same

schoollet me request you to consider how far you would accept this as

an account of the two lives of the temperate and intemperate in a

figurethere are two men both of whom have a number of casks the one

man has his casks sound and full one of wine another of honey and a third of

milk besides others filled with other liquids and the streams which fill them

are few and scanty and he can only obtain them with a great deal of toil and

difficulty but when his casks are once filled he has no need to feed them any

more and has no further trouble with them or care about them the other in

like manner can procure streams though not without difficulty but his

vessels are leaky and unsound and night and day he is compelled to be filling

them and if he pauses for a moment he is in an agony of pain such are their

respective livesand now would you say that the life of the intemperate

is happier than that of the temperate do i not convince you that the opposite

is the truth




callicles you do not convince me socrates for the one who has filled himself

has no longer any pleasure left and this as i was just now saying is the

life of a stone he has neither joy nor sorrow after he is once filled but the

pleasure depends on the superabundance of the influx




socrates but the more you pour in the greater the waste and the holes must

be large for the liquid to escape




callicles certainly




socrates the life which you are now depicting is not that of a dead man or of

a stone but of a cormorant you mean that he is to be hungering and eating




callicles yes




socrates and he is to be thirsting and drinking




callicles yes that is what i mean he is to have all his desires about him

and to be able to live happily in the gratification of them




socrates capital excellent go on as you have begun and have no shame i

too must disencumber myself of shame and first will you tell me whether you

include itching and scratching provided you have enough of them and pass your

life in scratching in your notion of happiness




callicles what a strange being you are socrates a regular moborator




socrates that was the reason callicles why i scared polus and gorgias until

they were too modest to say what they thought but you will not be too modest

and will not be scared for you are a brave man and now answer my question




callicles i answer that even the scratcher would live pleasantly




socrates and if pleasantly then also happily




callicles to be sure




socrates but what if the itching is not confined to the head shall i pursue

the question and here callicles i would have you consider how you would

reply if consequences are pressed upon you especially if in the last resort

you are asked whether the life of a catamite is not terrible foul miserable

or would you venture to say that they too are happy if they only get enough

of what they want




callicles are you not ashamed socrates of introducing such topics into the

argument




socrates well my fine friend but am i the introducer of these topics or he

who says without any qualification that all who feel pleasure in whatever

manner are happy and who admits of no distinction between good and bad

pleasures and i would still ask whether you say that pleasure and good are

the same or whether there is some pleasure which is not a good




callicles well then for the sake of consistency i will say that they are

the same




socrates you are breaking the original agreement callicles and will no

longer be a satisfactory companion in the search after truth if you say what

is contrary to your real opinion




callicles why that is what you are doing too socrates




socrates then we are both doing wrong still my dear friend i would ask you

to consider whether pleasure from whatever source derived is the good for

if this be true then the disagreeable consequences which have been darkly

intimated must follow and many others




callicles that socrates is only your opinion




socrates and do you callicles seriously maintain what you are saying




callicles indeed i do




socrates then as you are in earnest shall we proceed with the argument




callicles by all means or i am in profound earnest




socrates well if you are willing to proceed determine this question for

methere is something i presume which you would call knowledge




callicles there is




socrates and were you not saying just now that some courage implied

knowledge




callicles i was




socrates and you were speaking of courage and knowledge as two things

different from one another




callicles certainly i was




socrates and would you say that pleasure and knowledge are the same or not

the same




callicles not the same o man of wisdom




socrates and would you say that courage differed from pleasure




callicles certainly




socrates well then let us remember that callicles the acharnian says that

pleasure and good are the same but that knowledge and courage are not the

same either with one another or with the good




callicles and what does our friend socrates of foxton saydoes he

assent to this or not




socrates he does not assent neither will callicles when he sees himself

truly you will admit i suppose that good and evil fortune are opposed to

each other




callicles yes




socrates and if they are opposed to each other then like health and disease

they exclude one another a man cannot have them both or be without them both

at the same time




callicles what do you mean




socrates take the case of any bodily affectiona man may have the

complaint in his eyes which is called ophthalmia




callicles to be sure




socrates but he surely cannot have the same eyes well and sound at the same

time




callicles certainly not




socrates and when he has got rid of his ophthalmia has he got rid of the

health of his eyes too is the final result that he gets rid of them both

together




callicles certainly not




socrates that would surely be marvellous and absurd




callicles very




socrates i suppose that he is affected by them and gets rid of them in turns




callicles yes




socrates and he may have strength and weakness in the same way by fits




callicles yes




socrates or swiftness and slowness




callicles certainly




socrates and does he have and not have good and happiness and their

opposites evil and misery in a similar alternation compare republic




callicles certainly he has




socrates if then there be anything which a man has and has not at the same

time clearly that cannot be good and evildo we agree please not to

answer without consideration




callicles i entirely agree




socrates go back now to our former admissionsdid you say that to

hunger i mean the mere state of hunger was pleasant or painful




callicles i said painful but that to eat when you are hungry is pleasant




socrates i know but still the actual hunger is painful am i not right




callicles yes




socrates and thirst too is painful




callicles yes very




socrates need i adduce any more instances or would you agree that all wants

or desires are painful




callicles i agree and therefore you need not adduce any more instances




socrates very good and you would admit that to drink when you are thirsty

is pleasant




callicles yes




socrates and in the sentence which you have just uttered the word

thirsty implies pain




callicles yes




socrates and the word drinking is expressive of pleasure and of

the satisfaction of the want




callicles yes




socrates there is pleasure in drinking




callicles certainly




socrates when you are thirsty




socrates and in pain




callicles yes




socrates do you see the inferencethat pleasure and pain are

simultaneous when you say that being thirsty you drink for are they not

simultaneous and do they not affect at the same time the same part whether of

the soul or the bodywhich of them is affected cannot be supposed to be

of any consequence is not this true




callicles it is




socrates you said also that no man could have good and evil fortune at the

same time




callicles yes i did




socrates but you admitted that when in pain a man might also have pleasure




callicles clearly




socrates then pleasure is not the same as good fortune or pain the same as

evil fortune and therefore the good is not the same as the pleasant




callicles i wish i knew socrates what your quibbling means




socrates you know callicles but you affect not to know




callicles well get on and dont keep fooling then you will know what

a wiseacre you are in your admonition of me




socrates does not a man cease from his thirst and from his pleasure in

drinking at the same time




callicles i do not understand what you are saying




gorgias nay callicles answer if only for our sakeswe should like to

hear the argument out




callicles yes gorgias but i must complain of the habitual trifling of

socrates he is always arguing about little and unworthy questions




gorgias what matter your reputation callicles is not at stake let socrates

argue in his own fashion




callicles well then socrates you shall ask these little peddling questions

since gorgias wishes to have them




socrates i envy you callicles for having been initiated into the great

mysteries before you were initiated into the lesser i thought that this was

not allowable but to return to our argumentdoes not a man cease from

thirsting and from the pleasure of drinking at the same moment




callicles true




socrates and if he is hungry or has any other desire does he not cease from

the desire and the pleasure at the same moment




callicles very true




socrates then he ceases from pain and pleasure at the same moment




callicles yes




socrates but he does not cease from good and evil at the same moment as you

have admitted do you still adhere to what you said




callicles yes i do but what is the inference




socrates why my friend the inference is that the good is not the same as the

pleasant or the evil the same as the painful there is a cessation of pleasure

and pain at the same moment but not of good and evil for they are different

how then can pleasure be the same as good or pain as evil and i would have

you look at the matter in another light which could hardly i think have been

considered by you when you identified them are not the good good because they

have good present with them as the beautiful are those who have beauty present

with them




callicles yes




socrates and do you call the fools and cowards good men for you were saying

just now that the courageous and the wise are the goodwould you not say

so




callicles certainly




socrates and did you never see a foolish child rejoicing




callicles yes i have




socrates and a foolish man too




callicles yes certainly but what is your drift




socrates nothing particular if you will only answer




callicles yes i have




socrates and did you ever see a sensible man rejoicing or sorrowing




callicles yes




socrates which rejoice and sorrow mostthe wise or the foolish




callicles they are much upon a par i think in that respect




socrates enough and did you ever see a coward in battle




callicles to be sure




socrates and which rejoiced most at the departure of the enemy the coward or

the brave




callicles i should say most of both or at any rate they

rejoiced about equally




socrates no matter then the cowards and not only the brave rejoice




callicles greatly




socrates and the foolish so it would seem




callicles yes




socrates and are only the cowards pained at the approach of their enemies or

are the brave also pained




callicles both are pained




socrates and are they equally pained




callicles i should imagine that the cowards are more pained




socrates and are they not better pleased at the enemys departure




callicles i dare say




socrates then are the foolish and the wise and the cowards and the brave all

pleased and pained as you were saying in nearly equal degree but are the

cowards more pleased and pained than the brave




callicles yes




socrates but surely the wise and brave are the good and the foolish and the

cowardly are the bad




callicles yes




socrates then the good and the bad are pleased and pained in a nearly equal

degree




callicles yes




socrates then are the good and bad good and bad in a nearly equal degree or

have the bad the advantage both in good and evil ie in having more pleasure

and more pain




callicles i really do not know what you mean




socrates why do you not remember saying that the good were good because good

was present with them and the evil because evil and that pleasures were goods

and pains evils




callicles yes i remember




socrates and are not these pleasures or goods present to those who

rejoiceif they do rejoice




callicles certainly




socrates then those who rejoice are good when goods are present with them




callicles yes




socrates and those who are in pain have evil or sorrow present with them




callicles yes




socrates and would you still say that the evil are evil by reason of the

presence of evil




callicles i should




socrates then those who rejoice are good and those who are in pain evil




callicles yes




socrates the degrees of good and evil vary with the degrees of pleasure and of

pain




callicles yes




socrates have the wise man and the fool the brave and the coward joy and

pain in nearly equal degrees or would you say that the coward has more




callicles i should say that he has




socrates help me then to draw out the conclusion which follows from our

admissions for it is good to repeat and review what is good twice and thrice

over as they say both the wise man and the brave man we allow to be good




callicles yes




socrates and the foolish man and the coward to be evil




callicles certainly




socrates and he who has joy is good




callicles yes




socrates and he who is in pain is evil




callicles certainly




socrates the good and evil both have joy and pain but perhaps the evil has

more of them




callicles yes




socrates then must we not infer that the bad man is as good and bad as the

good or perhaps even betteris not this a further inference which

follows equally with the preceding from the assertion that the good and the

pleasant are the samecan this be denied callicles




callicles i have been listening and making admissions to you socrates and i

remark that if a person grants you anything in play you like a child want to

keep hold and will not give it back but do you really suppose that i or any

other human being denies that some pleasures are good and others bad




socrates alas callicles how unfair you are you certainly treat me as if i

were a child sometimes saying one thing and then another as if you were

meaning to deceive me and yet i thought at first that you were my friend and

would not have deceived me if you could have helped but i see that i was

mistaken and now i suppose that i must make the best of a bad business as

they said of old and take what i can get out of youwell then as i

understand you to say i may assume that some pleasures are good and others

evil




callicles yes




socrates the beneficial are good and the hurtful are evil




callicles to be sure




socrates and the beneficial are those which do some good and the hurtful are

those which do some evil




callicles yes




socrates take for example the bodily pleasures of eating and drinking which

we were just now mentioningyou mean to say that those which promote

health or any other bodily excellence are good and their opposites evil




callicles certainly




socrates and in the same way there are good pains and there are evil pains




callicles to be sure




socrates and ought we not to choose and use the good pleasures and pains




callicles certainly




socrates but not the evil




callicles clearly




socrates because if you remember polus and i have agreed that all our

actions are to be done for the sake of the goodand will you agree with

us in saying that the good is the end of all our actions and that all our

actions are to be done for the sake of the good and not the good for the sake

of themwill you add a third vote to our two




callicles i will




socrates then pleasure like everything else is to be sought for the sake of

that which is good and not that which is good for the sake of pleasure




callicles to be sure




socrates but can every man choose what pleasures are good and what are evil

or must he have art or knowledge of them in detail




callicles he must have art




socrates let me now remind you of what i was saying to gorgias and polus i

was saying as you will not have forgotten that there were some processes

which aim only at pleasure and know nothing of a better and worse and there

are other processes which know good and evil and i considered that cookery

which i do not call an art but only an experience was of the former class

which is concerned with pleasure and that the art of medicine was of the class

which is concerned with the good and now by the god of friendship i must beg

you callicles not to jest or to imagine that i am jesting with you do not

answer at random and contrary to your real opinionfor you will observe

that we are arguing about the way of human life and to a man who has any sense

at all what question can be more serious than thiswhether he should

follow after that way of life to which you exhort me and act what you call the

manly part of speaking in the assembly and cultivating rhetoric and engaging

in public affairs according to the principles now in vogue or whether he

should pursue the life of philosophyand in what the latter way differs

from the former but perhaps we had better first try to distinguish them as i

did before and when we have come to an agreement that they are distinct we

may proceed to consider in what they differ from one another and which of them

we should choose perhaps however you do not even now understand what i mean




callicles no i do not




socrates then i will explain myself more clearly seeing that you and i have

agreed that there is such a thing as good and that there is such a thing as

pleasure and that pleasure is not the same as good and that the pursuit and

process of acquisition of the one that is pleasure is different from the

pursuit and process of acquisition of the other which is goodi wish

that you would tell me whether you agree with me thus far or notdo you

agree




callicles i do




socrates then i will proceed and ask whether you also agree with me and

whether you think that i spoke the truth when i further said to gorgias and

polus that cookery in my opinion is only an experience and not an art at all

and that whereas medicine is an art and attends to the nature and constitution

of the patient and has principles of action and reason in each case cookery

in attending upon pleasure never regards either the nature or reason of that

pleasure to which she devotes herself but goes straight to her end nor ever

considers or calculates anything but works by experience and routine and just

preserves the recollection of what she has usually done when producing

pleasure and first i would have you consider whether i have proved what i was

saying and then whether there are not other similar processes which have to do

with the soulsome of them processes of art making a provision for the

souls highest interestothers despising the interest and as in

the previous case considering only the pleasure of the soul and how this may

be acquired but not considering what pleasures are good or bad and having no

other aim but to afford gratification whether good or bad in my opinion

callicles there are such processes and this is the sort of thing which i term

flattery whether concerned with the body or the soul or whenever employed

with a view to pleasure and without any consideration of good and evil and now

i wish that you would tell me whether you agree with us in this notion or

whether you differ




callicles i do not differ on the contrary i agree for in that way i shall

soonest bring the argument to an end and shall oblige my friend gorgias




socrates and is this notion true of one soul or of two or more




callicles equally true of two or more




socrates then a man may delight a whole assembly and yet have no regard for

their true interests




callicles yes




socrates can you tell me the pursuits which delight mankindor rather

if you would prefer let me ask and do you answer which of them belong to the

pleasurable class and which of them not in the first place what say you of

fluteplaying does not that appear to be an art which seeks only pleasure

callicles and thinks of nothing else




callicles i assent




socrates and is not the same true of all similar arts as for example the

art of playing the lyre at festivals




callicles yes




socrates and what do you say of the choral art and of dithyrambic

poetryare not they of the same nature do you imagine that cinesias the

son of meles cares about what will tend to the moral improvement of his

hearers or about what will give pleasure to the multitude




callicles there can be no mistake about cinesias socrates




socrates and what do you say of his father meles the harpplayer did he

perform with any view to the good of his hearers could he be said to regard

even their pleasure for his singing was an infliction to his audience and of

harpplaying and dithyrambic poetry in general what would you say have they

not been invented wholly for the sake of pleasure




callicles that is my notion of them




socrates and as for the muse of tragedy that solemn and august

personagewhat are her aspirations is all her aim and desire only to

give pleasure to the spectators or does she fight against them and refuse to

speak of their pleasant vices and willingly proclaim in word and song truths

welcome and unwelcomewhich in your judgment is her character




callicles there can be no doubt socrates that tragedy has her face turned

towards pleasure and the gratification of the audience




socrates and is not that the sort of thing callicles which we were just now

describing as flattery




callicles quite true




socrates well now suppose that we strip all poetry of song and rhythm and

metre there will remain speech compare republic




callicles to be sure




socrates and this speech is addressed to a crowd of people




callicles yes




socrates then poetry is a sort of rhetoric




callicles true




socrates and do not the poets in the theatres seem to you to be rhetoricians




callicles yes




socrates then now we have discovered a sort of rhetoric which is addressed to

a crowd of men women and children freemen and slaves and this is not much

to our taste for we have described it as having the nature of flattery




callicles quite true




socrates very good and what do you say of that other rhetoric which addresses

the athenian assembly and the assemblies of freemen in other states do the

rhetoricians appear to you always to aim at what is best and do they seek to

improve the citizens by their speeches or are they too like the rest of

mankind bent upon giving them pleasure forgetting the public good in the

thought of their own interest playing with the people as with children and

trying to amuse them but never considering whether they are better or worse

for this




callicles i must distinguish there are some who have a real care of the

public in what they say while others are such as you describe




socrates i am contented with the admission that rhetoric is of two sorts one

which is mere flattery and disgraceful declamation the other which is noble

and aims at the training and improvement of the souls of the citizens and

strives to say what is best whether welcome or unwelcome to the audience but

have you ever known such a rhetoric or if you have and can point out any

rhetorician who is of this stamp who is he




callicles but indeed i am afraid that i cannot tell you of any such among

the orators who are at present living




socrates well then can you mention any one of a former generation who may

be said to have improved the athenians who found them worse and made them

better from the day that he began to make speeches for indeed i do not know

of such a man




callicles what did you never hear that themistocles was a good man and cimon

and miltiades and pericles who is just lately dead and whom you heard

yourself




socrates yes callicles they were good men if as you said at first true

virtue consists only in the satisfaction of our own desires and those of

others but if not and if as we were afterwards compelled to acknowledge the

satisfaction of some desires makes us better and of others worse and we

ought to gratify the one and not the other and there is an art in

distinguishing themcan you tell me of any of these statesmen who did

distinguish them




callicles no indeed i cannot




socrates yet surely callicles if you look you will find such a one suppose

that we just calmly consider whether any of these was such as i have described

will not the good man who says whatever he says with a view to the best speak

with a reference to some standard and not at random just as all other artists

whether the painter the builder the shipwright or any other look all of them

to their own work and do not select and apply at random what they apply but

strive to give a definite form to it the artist disposes all things in order

and compels the one part to harmonize and accord with the other part until he

has constructed a regular and systematic whole and this is true of all

artists and in the same way the trainers and physicians of whom we spoke

before give order and regularity to the body do you deny this




callicles no i am ready to admit it




socrates then the house in which order and regularity prevail is good that in

which there is disorder evil




callicles yes




socrates and the same is true of a ship




callicles yes




socrates and the same may be said of the human body




callicles yes




socrates and what would you say of the soul will the good soul be that in

which disorder is prevalent or that in which there is harmony and order




callicles the latter follows from our previous admissions




socrates what is the name which is given to the effect of harmony and order in

the body




callicles i suppose that you mean health and strength




socrates yes i do and what is the name which you would give to the effect of

harmony and order in the soul try and discover a name for this as well as for

the other




callicles why not give the name yourself socrates




socrates well if you had rather that i should i will and you shall say

whether you agree with me and if not you shall refute and answer me

healthy as i conceive is the name which is given to the regular

order of the body whence comes health and every other bodily excellence is

that true or not




callicles true




socrates and lawful and law are the names which

are given to the regular order and action of the soul and these make men

lawful and orderlyand so we have temperance and justice have we not




callicles granted




socrates and will not the true rhetorician who is honest and understands his

art have his eye fixed upon these in all the words which he addresses to the

souls of men and in all his actions both in what he gives and in what he

takes away will not his aim be to implant justice in the souls of his citizens

and take away injustice to implant temperance and take away intemperance to

implant every virtue and take away every vice do you not agree




callicles i agree




socrates for what use is there callicles in giving to the body of a sick man

who is in a bad state of health a quantity of the most delightful food or drink

or any other pleasant thing which may be really as bad for him as if you gave

him nothing or even worse if rightly estimated is not that true




callicles i will not say no to it




socrates for in my opinion there is no profit in a mans life if his

body is in an evil plightin that case his life also is evil am i not

right




callicles yes




socrates when a man is in health the physicians will generally allow him to

eat when he is hungry and drink when he is thirsty and to satisfy his desires

as he likes but when he is sick they hardly suffer him to satisfy his desires

at all even you will admit that




callicles yes




socrates and does not the same argument hold of the soul my good sir while

she is in a bad state and is senseless and intemperate and unjust and unholy

her desires ought to be controlled and she ought to be prevented from doing

anything which does not tend to her own improvement




callicles yes




socrates such treatment will be better for the soul herself




callicles to be sure




socrates and to restrain her from her appetites is to chastise her




callicles yes




socrates then restraint or chastisement is better for the soul than

intemperance or the absence of control which you were just now preferring




callicles i do not understand you socrates and i wish that you would ask

some one who does




socrates here is a gentleman who cannot endure to be improved or to subject

himself to that very chastisement of which the argument speaks




callicles i do not heed a word of what you are saying and have only answered

hitherto out of civility to gorgias




socrates what are we to do then shall we break off in the middle




callicles you shall judge for yourself




socrates well but people say that a tale should have a head and not

break off in the middle and i should not like to have the argument

going about without a head compare laws please then to go on a little

longer and put the head on




callicles how tyrannical you are socrates i wish that you and your argument

would rest or that you would get some one else to argue with you




socrates but who else is willingi want to finish the argument




callicles cannot you finish without my help either talking straight on or

questioning and answering yourself




socrates must i then say with epicharmus two men spoke before but now

one shall be enough i suppose that there is absolutely no help and if

i am to carry on the enquiry by myself i will first of all remark that not

only i but all of us should have an ambition to know what is true and what is

false in this matter for the discovery of the truth is a common good and now

i will proceed to argue according to my own notion but if any of you think

that i arrive at conclusions which are untrue you must interpose and refute me

for i do not speak from any knowledge of what i am saying i am an enquirer

like yourselves and therefore if my opponent says anything which is of force

i shall be the first to agree with him i am speaking on the supposition that

the argument ought to be completed but if you think otherwise let us leave off

and go our ways




gorgias i think socrates that we should not go our ways until you have

completed the argument and this appears to me to be the wish of the rest of

the company i myself should very much like to hear what more you have to say




socrates i too gorgias should have liked to continue the argument with

callicles and then i might have given him an amphion in return

for his zethus but since you callicles are unwilling to

continue i hope that you will listen and interrupt me if i seem to you to be

in error and if you refute me i shall not be angry with you as you are with

me but i shall inscribe you as the greatest of benefactors on the tablets of

my soul




callicles my good fellow never mind me but get on




socrates listen to me then while i recapitulate the argumentis the

pleasant the same as the good not the same callicles and i are agreed about

that and is the pleasant to be pursued for the sake of the good or the good

for the sake of the pleasant the pleasant is to be pursued for the sake of the

good and that is pleasant at the presence of which we are pleased and that is

good at the presence of which we are good to be sure and we are good and all

good things whatever are good when some virtue is present in us or them that

callicles is my conviction but the virtue of each thing whether body or

soul instrument or creature when given to them in the best way comes to them

not by chance but as the result of the order and truth and art which are

imparted to them am i not right i maintain that i am and is not the virtue

of each thing dependent on order or arrangement yes i say and that which

makes a thing good is the proper order inhering in each thing such is my view

and is not the soul which has an order of her own better than that which has no

order certainly and the soul which has order is orderly of course and that

which is orderly is temperate assuredly and the temperate soul is good no

other answer can i give callicles dear have you any




callicles go on my good fellow




socrates then i shall proceed to add that if the temperate soul is the good

soul the soul which is in the opposite condition that is the foolish and

intemperate is the bad soul very true




and will not the temperate man do what is proper both in relation to the gods

and to menfor he would not be temperate if he did not certainly he

will do what is proper in his relation to other men he will do what is just

and in his relation to the gods he will do what is holy and he who does what

is just and holy must be just and holy very true and must he not be

courageous for the duty of a temperate man is not to follow or to avoid what

he ought not but what he ought whether things or men or pleasures or pains

and patiently to endure when he ought and therefore callicles the temperate

man being as we have described also just and courageous and holy cannot be

other than a perfectly good man nor can the good man do otherwise than well

and perfectly whatever he does and he who does well must of necessity be happy

and blessed and the evil man who does evil miserable now this latter is he

whom you were applaudingthe intemperate who is the opposite of the

temperate such is my position and these things i affirm to be true and if

they are true then i further affirm that he who desires to be happy must

pursue and practise temperance and run away from intemperance as fast as his

legs will carry him he had better order his life so as not to need punishment

but if either he or any of his friends whether private individual or city are

in need of punishment then justice must be done and he must suffer punishment

if he would be happy this appears to me to be the aim which a man ought to

have and towards which he ought to direct all the energies both of himself and

of the state acting so that he may have temperance and justice present with

him and be happy not suffering his lusts to be unrestrained and in the

neverending desire satisfy them leading a robbers life such a one is

the friend neither of god nor man for he is incapable of communion and he who

is incapable of communion is also incapable of friendship and philosophers

tell us callicles that communion and friendship and orderliness and

temperance and justice bind together heaven and earth and gods and men and

that this universe is therefore called cosmos or order not disorder or

misrule my friend but although you are a philosopher you seem to me never to

have observed that geometrical equality is mighty both among gods and men you

think that you ought to cultivate inequality or excess and do not care about

geometrywell then either the principle that the happy are made happy

by the possession of justice and temperance and the miserable miserable by the

possession of vice must be refuted or if it is granted what will be the

consequences all the consequences which i drew before callicles and about

which you asked me whether i was in earnest when i said that a man ought to

accuse himself and his son and his friend if he did anything wrong and that to

this end he should use his rhetoricall those consequences are true and

that which you thought that polus was led to admit out of modesty is true

viz that to do injustice if more disgraceful than to suffer is in that

degree worse and the other position which according to polus gorgias

admitted out of modesty that he who would truly be a rhetorician ought to be

just and have a knowledge of justice has also turned out to be true




and now these things being as we have said let us proceed in the next place

to consider whether you are right in throwing in my teeth that i am unable to

help myself or any of my friends or kinsmen or to save them in the extremity

of danger and that i am in the power of another like an outlaw to whom any one

may do what he likeshe may box my ears which was a brave saying of

yours or take away my goods or banish me or even do his worst and kill me a

condition which as you say is the height of disgrace my answer to you is one

which has been already often repeated but may as well be repeated once more i

tell you callicles that to be boxed on the ears wrongfully is not the worst

evil which can befall a man nor to have my purse or my body cut open but that

to smite and slay me and mine wrongfully is far more disgraceful and more evil

aye and to despoil and enslave and pillage or in any way at all to wrong me

and mine is far more disgraceful and evil to the doer of the wrong than to me

who am the sufferer these truths which have been already set forth as i state

them in the previous discussion would seem now to have been fixed and riveted

by us if i may use an expression which is certainly bold in words which are

like bonds of iron and adamant and unless you or some other still more

enterprising hero shall break them there is no possibility of denying what i

say for my position has always been that i myself am ignorant how these

things are but that i have never met any one who could say otherwise any more

than you can and not appear ridiculous this is my position still and if what

i am saying is true and injustice is the greatest of evils to the doer of

injustice and yet there is if possible a greater than this greatest of evils

compare republic in an unjust man not suffering retribution what is that

defence of which the want will make a man truly ridiculous must not the

defence be one which will avert the greatest of human evils and will not the

worst of all defences be that with which a man is unable to defend himself or

his family or his friendsand next will come that which is unable to

avert the next greatest evil thirdly that which is unable to avert the third

greatest evil and so of other evils as is the greatness of evil so is the

honour of being able to avert them in their several degrees and the disgrace

of not being able to avert them am i not right callicles




callicles yes quite right




socrates seeing then that there are these two evils the doing injustice and

the suffering injusticeand we affirm that to do injustice is a greater

and to suffer injustice a lesser evilby what devices can a man succeed

in obtaining the two advantages the one of not doing and the other of not

suffering injustice must he have the power or only the will to obtain them i

mean to ask whether a man will escape injustice if he has only the will to

escape or must he have provided himself with the power




callicles he must have provided himself with the power that is clear




socrates and what do you say of doing injustice is the will only sufficient

and will that prevent him from doing injustice or must he have provided

himself with power and art and if he have not studied and practised will he

be unjust still surely you might say callicles whether you think that polus

and i were right in admitting the conclusion that no one does wrong

voluntarily but that all do wrong against their will




callicles granted socrates if you will only have done




socrates then as would appear power and art have to be provided in order

that we may do no injustice




callicles certainly




socrates and what art will protect us from suffering injustice if not wholly

yet as far as possible i want to know whether you agree with me for i think

that such an art is the art of one who is either a ruler or even tyrant

himself or the equal and companion of the ruling power




callicles well said socrates and please to observe how ready i am to praise

you when you talk sense




socrates think and tell me whether you would approve of another view of mine

to me every man appears to be most the friend of him who is most like to

himlike to like as ancient sages say would you not agree to this




callicles i should




socrates but when the tyrant is rude and uneducated he may be expected to

fear any one who is his superior in virtue and will never be able to be

perfectly friendly with him




callicles that is true




socrates neither will he be the friend of any one who is greatly his inferior

for the tyrant will despise him and will never seriously regard him as a

friend




callicles that again is true




socrates then the only friend worth mentioning whom the tyrant can have will

be one who is of the same character and has the same likes and dislikes and

is at the same time willing to be subject and subservient to him he is the man

who will have power in the state and no one will injure him with

impunityis not that so




callicles yes




socrates and if a young man begins to ask how he may become great and

formidable this would seem to be the wayhe will accustom himself from

his youth upward to feel sorrow and joy on the same occasions as his master

and will contrive to be as like him as possible




callicles yes




socrates and in this way he will have accomplished as you and your friends

would say the end of becoming a great man and not suffering injury




callicles very true




socrates but will he also escape from doing injury must not the very opposite

be trueif he is to be like the tyrant in his injustice and to have

influence with him will he not rather contrive to do as much wrong as

possible and not be punished




callicles true




socrates and by the imitation of his master and by the power which he thus

acquires will not his soul become bad and corrupted and will not this be the

greatest evil to him




callicles you always contrive somehow or other socrates to invert

everything do you not know that he who imitates the tyrant will if he has a

mind kill him who does not imitate him and take away his goods




socrates excellent callicles i am not deaf and i have heard that a great

many times from you and from polus and from nearly every man in the city but i

wish that you would hear me too i dare say that he will kill him if he has a

mindthe bad man will kill the good and true




callicles and is not that just the provoking thing




socrates nay not to a man of sense as the argument shows do you think that

all our cares should be directed to prolonging life to the uttermost and to

the study of those arts which secure us from danger always like that art of

rhetoric which saves men in courts of law and which you advise me to

cultivate




callicles yes truly and very good advice too




socrates well my friend but what do you think of swimming is that an art of

any great pretensions




callicles no indeed




socrates and yet surely swimming saves a man from death and there are

occasions on which he must know how to swim and if you despise the swimmers i

will tell you of another and greater art the art of the pilot who not only

saves the souls of men but also their bodies and properties from the extremity

of danger just like rhetoric yet his art is modest and unpresuming it has no

airs or pretences of doing anything extraordinary and in return for the same

salvation which is given by the pleader demands only two obols if he brings

us from aegina to athens or for the longer voyage from pontus or egypt at the

utmost two drachmae when he has saved as i was just now saying the passenger

and his wife and children and goods and safely disembarked them at the

piraeusthis is the payment which he asks in return for so great a boon

and he who is the master of the art and has done all this gets out and walks

about on the seashore by his ship in an unassuming way for he is able to

reflect and is aware that he cannot tell which of his fellowpassengers he has

benefited and which of them he has injured in not allowing them to be drowned

he knows that they are just the same when he has disembarked them as when they

embarked and not a whit better either in their bodies or in their souls and

he considers that if a man who is afflicted by great and incurable bodily

diseases is only to be pitied for having escaped and is in no way benefited by

him in having been saved from drowning much less he who has great and

incurable diseases not of the body but of the soul which is the more

valuable part of him neither is life worth having nor of any profit to the bad

man whether he be delivered from the sea or the lawcourts or any other

devourerand so he reflects that such a one had better not live for he

cannot live well compare republic




and this is the reason why the pilot although he is our saviour is not

usually conceited any more than the engineer who is not at all behind either

the general or the pilot or any one else in his saving power for he

sometimes saves whole cities is there any comparison between him and the

pleader and if he were to talk callicles in your grandiose style he would

bury you under a mountain of words declaring and insisting that we ought all

of us to be enginemakers and that no other profession is worth thinking

about he would have plenty to say nevertheless you despise him and his art

and sneeringly call him an enginemaker and you will not allow your daughters

to marry his son or marry your son to his daughters and yet on your

principle what justice or reason is there in your refusal what right have you

to despise the enginemaker and the others whom i was just now mentioning i

know that you will say i am better and better born but if the

better is not what i say and virtue consists only in a man saving himself and

his whatever may be his character then your censure of the enginemaker and

of the physician and of the other arts of salvation is ridiculous o my

friend i want you to see that the noble and the good may possibly be something

different from saving and being savedmay not he who is truly a man

cease to care about living a certain timehe knows as women say that

no man can escape fate and therefore he is not fond of life he leaves all

that with god and considers in what way he can best spend his appointed

termwhether by assimilating himself to the constitution under which he

lives as you at this moment have to consider how you may become as like as

possible to the athenian people if you mean to be in their good graces and to

have power in the state whereas i want you to think and see whether this is

for the interest of either of usi would not have us risk that which is

dearest on the acquisition of this power like the thessalian enchantresses

who as they say bring down the moon from heaven at the risk of their own

perdition but if you suppose that any man will show you the art of becoming

great in the city and yet not conforming yourself to the ways of the city

whether for better or worse then i can only say that you are mistaken

callides for he who would deserve to be the true natural friend of the

athenian demus aye or of pyrilampes darling who is called after them

must be by nature like them and not an imitator only he then who will make

you most like them will make you as you desire a statesman and orator for

every man is pleased when he is spoken to in his own language and spirit and

dislikes any other but perhaps you sweet callicles may be of another mind

what do you say




callicles somehow or other your words socrates always appear to me to be

good words and yet like the rest of the world i am not quite convinced by

them compare symp  alcib




socrates the reason is callicles that the love of demus which abides in your

soul is an adversary to me but i dare say that if we recur to these same

matters and consider them more thoroughly you may be convinced for all that

please then to remember that there are two processes of training all things

including body and soul in the one as we said we treat them with a view to

pleasure and in the other with a view to the highest good and then we do not

indulge but resist them was not that the distinction which we drew




callicles very true




socrates and the one which had pleasure in view was just a vulgar

flatterywas not that another of our conclusions




callicles be it so if you will have it




socrates and the other had in view the greatest improvement of that which was

ministered to whether body or soul




callicles quite true




socrates and must we not have the same end in view in the treatment of our

city and citizens must we not try and make them as good as possible for we

have already discovered that there is no use in imparting to them any other

good unless the mind of those who are to have the good whether money or

office or any other sort of power be gentle and good shall we say that




callicles yes certainly if you like




socrates well then if you and i callicles were intending to set about some

public business and were advising one another to undertake buildings such as

walls docks or temples of the largest size ought we not to examine ourselves

first as to whether we know or do not know the art of building and who taught

uswould not that be necessary callicles




callicles true




socrates in the second place we should have to consider whether we had ever

constructed any private house either of our own or for our friends and

whether this building of ours was a success or not and if upon consideration

we found that we had had good and eminent masters and had been successful in

constructing many fine buildings not only with their assistance but without

them by our own unaided skillin that case prudence would not dissuade

us from proceeding to the construction of public works but if we had no master

to show and only a number of worthless buildings or none at all then surely

it would be ridiculous in us to attempt public works or to advise one another

to undertake them is not this true




callicles certainly




socrates and does not the same hold in all other cases if you and i were

physicians and were advising one another that we were competent to practise as

statephysicians should i not ask about you and would you not ask about me

well but how about socrates himself has he good health and was any one else

ever known to be cured by him whether slave or freeman and i should make the

same enquiries about you and if we arrived at the conclusion that no one

whether citizen or stranger man or woman had ever been any the better for the

medical skill of either of us then by heaven callicles what an absurdity to

think that we or any human being should be so silly as to set up as

statephysicians and advise others like ourselves to do the same without

having first practised in private whether successfully or not and acquired

experience of the art is not this as they say to begin with the big jar when

you are learning the potters art which is a foolish thing




callicles true




socrates and now my friend as you are already beginning to be a public

character and are admonishing and reproaching me for not being one suppose

that we ask a few questions of one another tell me then callicles how about

making any of the citizens better was there ever a man who was once vicious

or unjust or intemperate or foolish and became by the help of callicles good

and noble was there ever such a man whether citizen or stranger slave or

freeman tell me callicles if a person were to ask these questions of you

what would you answer whom would you say that you had improved by your

conversation there may have been good deeds of this sort which were done by

you as a private person before you came forward in public why will you not

answer




callicles you are contentious socrates




socrates nay i ask you not from a love of contention but because i really

want to know in what way you think that affairs should be administered among

uswhether when you come to the administration of them you have any

other aim but the improvement of the citizens have we not already admitted

many times over that such is the duty of a public man nay we have surely said

so for if you will not answer for yourself i must answer for you but if this

is what the good man ought to effect for the benefit of his own state allow me

to recall to you the names of those whom you were just now mentioning

pericles and cimon and miltiades and themistocles and ask whether you still

think that they were good citizens




callicles i do




socrates but if they were good then clearly each of them must have made the

citizens better instead of worse




callicles yes




socrates and therefore when pericles first began to speak in the assembly

the athenians were not so good as when he spoke last




callicles very likely




socrates nay my friend likely is not the word for if he was a

good citizen the inference is certain




callicles and what difference does that make




socrates none only i should like further to know whether the athenians are

supposed to have been made better by pericles or on the contrary to have

been corrupted by him for i hear that he was the first who gave the people

pay and made them idle and cowardly and encouraged them in the love of talk

and money




callicles you heard that socrates from the laconising set who bruise their

ears




socrates but what i am going to tell you now is not mere hearsay but well

known both to you and me that at first pericles was glorious and his

character unimpeached by any verdict of the atheniansthis was during the

time when they were not so goodyet afterwards when they had been made

good and gentle by him at the very end of his life they convicted him of

theft and almost put him to death clearly under the notion that he was a

malefactor




callicles well but how does that prove pericles badness




socrates why surely you would say that he was a bad manager of asses or

horses or oxen who had received them originally neither kicking nor butting

nor biting him and implanted in them all these savage tricks would he not be

a bad manager of any animals who received them gentle and made them fiercer

than they were when he received them what do you say




callicles i will do you the favour of saying yes




socrates and will you also do me the favour of saying whether man is an

animal




callicles certainly he is




socrates and was not pericles a shepherd of men




callicles yes




socrates and if he was a good political shepherd ought not the animals who

were his subjects as we were just now acknowledging to have become more just

and not more unjust




callicles quite true




socrates and are not just men gentle as homer saysor are you of

another mind




callicles i agree




socrates and yet he really did make them more savage than he received them

and their savageness was shown towards himself which he must have been very

far from desiring




callicles do you want me to agree with you




socrates yes if i seem to you to speak the truth




callicles granted then




socrates and if they were more savage must they not have been more unjust and

inferior




callicles granted again




socrates then upon this view pericles was not a good statesman




callicles that is upon your view




socrates nay the view is yours after what you have admitted take the case

of cimon again did not the very persons whom he was serving ostracize him in

order that they might not hear his voice for ten years and they did just the

same to themistocles adding the penalty of exile and they voted that

miltiades the hero of marathon should be thrown into the pit of death and he

was only saved by the prytanis and yet if they had been really good men as

you say these things would never have happened to them for the good

charioteers are not those who at first keep their place and then when they

have brokenin their horses and themselves become better charioteers are

thrown outthat is not the way either in charioteering or in any

professionwhat do you think




callicles i should think not




socrates well but if so the truth is as i have said already that in the

athenian state no one has ever shown himself to be a good statesmanyou

admitted that this was true of our present statesmen but not true of former

ones and you preferred them to the others yet they have turned out to be no

better than our present ones and therefore if they were rhetoricians they

did not use the true art of rhetoric or of flattery or they would not have

fallen out of favour




callicles but surely socrates no living man ever came near any one of them

in his performances




socrates o my dear friend i say nothing against them regarded as the

servingmen of the state and i do think that they were certainly more

serviceable than those who are living now and better able to gratify the

wishes of the state but as to transforming those desires and not allowing them

to have their way and using the powers which they had whether of persuasion

or of force in the improvement of their fellow citizens which is the prime

object of the truly good citizen i do not see that in these respects they were

a whit superior to our present statesmen although i do admit that they were

more clever at providing ships and walls and docks and all that you and i

have a ridiculous way for during the whole time that we are arguing we are

always going round and round to the same point and constantly misunderstanding

one another if i am not mistaken you have admitted and acknowledged more than

once that there are two kinds of operations which have to do with the body

and two which have to do with the soul one of the two is ministerial and if

our bodies are hungry provides food for them and if they are thirsty gives

them drink or if they are cold supplies them with garments blankets shoes

and all that they crave i use the same images as before intentionally in

order that you may understand me the better the purveyor of the articles may

provide them either wholesale or retail or he may be the maker of any of

themthe baker or the cook or the weaver or the shoemaker or the

currier and in so doing being such as he is he is naturally supposed by

himself and every one to minister to the body for none of them know that there

is another artan art of gymnastic and medicine which is the true

minister of the body and ought to be the mistress of all the rest and to use

their results according to the knowledge which she has and they have not of

the real good or bad effects of meats and drinks on the body all other arts

which have to do with the body are servile and menial and illiberal and

gymnastic and medicine are as they ought to be their mistresses now when i

say that all this is equally true of the soul you seem at first to know and

understand and assent to my words and then a little while afterwards you come

repeating has not the state had good and noble citizens and when i ask you

who they are you reply seemingly quite in earnest as if i had asked who are

or have been good trainersand you had replied thearion the baker

mithoecus who wrote the sicilian cookerybook sarambus the vintner these

are ministers of the body firstrate in their art for the first makes

admirable loaves the second excellent dishes and the third capital

wineto me these appear to be the exact parallel of the statesmen whom

you mention now you would not be altogether pleased if i said to you my

friend you know nothing of gymnastics those of whom you are speaking to me

are only the ministers and purveyors of luxury who have no good or noble

notions of their art and may very likely be filling and fattening mens

bodies and gaining their approval although the result is that they lose their

original flesh in the long run and become thinner than they were before and

yet they in their simplicity will not attribute their diseases and loss of

flesh to their entertainers but when in after years the unhealthy surfeit

brings the attendant penalty of disease he who happens to be near them at the

time and offers them advice is accused and blamed by them and if they could

they would do him some harm while they proceed to eulogize the men who have

been the real authors of the mischief and that callicles is just what you

are now doing you praise the men who feasted the citizens and satisfied their

desires and people say that they have made the city great not seeing that the

swollen and ulcerated condition of the state is to be attributed to these elder

statesmen for they have filled the city full of harbours and docks and walls

and revenues and all that and have left no room for justice and temperance

and when the crisis of the disorder comes the people will blame the advisers

of the hour and applaud themistocles and cimon and pericles who are the real

authors of their calamities and if you are not careful they may assail you and

my friend alcibiades when they are losing not only their new acquisitions but

also their original possessions not that you are the authors of these

misfortunes of theirs although you may perhaps be accessories to them a great

piece of work is always being made as i see and am told now as of old about

our statesmen when the state treats any of them as malefactors i observe that

there is a great uproar and indignation at the supposed wrong which is done to

them after all their many services to the state that they should

unjustly perishso the tale runs but the cry is all a lie for

no statesman ever could be unjustly put to death by the city of which he is the

head the case of the professed statesman is i believe very much like that of

the professed sophist for the sophists although they are wise men are

nevertheless guilty of a strange piece of folly professing to be teachers of

virtue they will often accuse their disciples of wronging them and defrauding

them of their pay and showing no gratitude for their services yet what can be

more absurd than that men who have become just and good and whose injustice

has been taken away from them and who have had justice implanted in them by

their teachers should act unjustly by reason of the injustice which is not in

them can anything be more irrational my friends than this you callicles

compel me to be a moborator because you will not answer




callicles and you are the man who cannot speak unless there is some one to

answer




socrates i suppose that i can just now at any rate the speeches which i am

making are long enough because you refuse to answer me but i adjure you by the

god of friendship my good sir do tell me whether there does not appear to you

to be a great inconsistency in saying that you have made a man good and then

blaming him for being bad




callicles yes it appears so to me




socrates do you never hear our professors of education speaking in this

inconsistent manner




callicles yes but why talk of men who are good for nothing




socrates i would rather say why talk of men who profess to be rulers and

declare that they are devoted to the improvement of the city and nevertheless

upon occasion declaim against the utter vileness of the citydo you

think that there is any difference between one and the other my good friend

the sophist and the rhetorician as i was saying to polus are the same or

nearly the same but you ignorantly fancy that rhetoric is a perfect thing and

sophistry a thing to be despised whereas the truth is that sophistry is as

much superior to rhetoric as legislation is to the practice of law or

gymnastic to medicine the orators and sophists as i am inclined to think are

the only class who cannot complain of the mischief ensuing to themselves from

that which they teach others without in the same breath accusing themselves of

having done no good to those whom they profess to benefit is not this a fact




callicles certainly it is




socrates if they were right in saying that they make men better then they are

the only class who can afford to leave their remuneration to those who have

been benefited by them whereas if a man has been benefited in any other way

if for example he has been taught to run by a trainer he might possibly

defraud him of his pay if the trainer left the matter to him and made no

agreement with him that he should receive money as soon as he had given him the

utmost speed for not because of any deficiency of speed do men act unjustly

but by reason of injustice




callicles very true




socrates and he who removes injustice can be in no danger of being treated

unjustly he alone can safely leave the honorarium to his pupils if he be

really able to make them goodam i not right compare protag




callicles yes




socrates then we have found the reason why there is no dishonour in a man

receiving pay who is called in to advise about building or any other art




callicles yes we have found the reason




socrates but when the point is how a man may become best himself and best

govern his family and state then to say that you will give no advice gratis is

held to be dishonourable




callicles true




socrates and why because only such benefits call forth a desire to requite

them and there is evidence that a benefit has been conferred when the

benefactor receives a return otherwise not is this true




callicles it is




socrates then to which service of the state do you invite me determine for

me am i to be the physician of the state who will strive and struggle to make

the athenians as good as possible or am i to be the servant and flatterer of

the state speak out my good friend freely and fairly as you did at first and

ought to do again and tell me your entire mind




callicles i say then that you should be the servant of the state




socrates the flatterer well sir that is a noble invitation




callicles the mysian socrates or what you please for if you refuse the

consequences will be




socrates do not repeat the old storythat he who likes will kill me and

get my money for then i shall have to repeat the old answer that he will be a

bad man and will kill the good and that the money will be of no use to him

but that he will wrongly use that which he wrongly took and if wrongly

basely and if basely hurtfully




callicles how confident you are socrates that you will never come to harm

you seem to think that you are living in another country and can never be

brought into a court of justice as you very likely may be brought by some

miserable and mean person




socrates then i must indeed be a fool callicles if i do not know that in the

athenian state any man may suffer anything and if i am brought to trial and

incur the dangers of which you speak he will be a villain who brings me to

trialof that i am very sure for no good man would accuse the innocent

nor shall i be surprised if i am put to death shall i tell you why i

anticipate this




callicles by all means




socrates i think that i am the only or almost the only athenian living who

practises the true art of politics i am the only politician of my time now

seeing that when i speak my words are not uttered with any view of gaining

favour and that i look to what is best and not to what is most pleasant

having no mind to use those arts and graces which you recommend i shall have

nothing to say in the justice court and you might argue with me as i was

arguing with polusi shall be tried just as a physician would be tried

in a court of little boys at the indictment of the cook what would he reply

under such circumstances if some one were to accuse him saying o my

boys many evil things has this man done to you he is the death of you

especially of the younger ones among you cutting and burning and starving and

suffocating you until you know not what to do he gives you the bitterest

potions and compels you to hunger and thirst how unlike the variety of meats

and sweets on which i feasted you what do you suppose that the

physician would be able to reply when he found himself in such a predicament

if he told the truth he could only say all these evil things my boys

i did for your health and then would there not just be a clamour among

a jury like that how they would cry out




callicles i dare say




socrates would he not be utterly at a loss for a reply




callicles he certainly would




socrates and i too shall be treated in the same way as i well know if i am

brought before the court for i shall not be able to rehearse to the people the

pleasures which i have procured for them and which although i am not disposed

to envy either the procurers or enjoyers of them are deemed by them to be

benefits and advantages and if any one says that i corrupt young men and

perplex their minds or that i speak evil of old men and use bitter words

towards them whether in private or public it is useless for me to reply as i

truly mightall this i do for the sake of justice and with a

view to your interest my judges and to nothing else and therefore

there is no saying what may happen to me




callicles and do you think socrates that a man who is thus defenceless is in

a good position




socrates yes callicles if he have that defence which as you have often

acknowledged he should haveif he be his own defence and have never said

or done anything wrong either in respect of gods or men and this has been

repeatedly acknowledged by us to be the best sort of defence and if any one

could convict me of inability to defend myself or others after this sort i

should blush for shame whether i was convicted before many or before a few

or by myself alone and if i died from want of ability to do so that would

indeed grieve me but if i died because i have no powers of flattery or

rhetoric i am very sure that you would not find me repining at death for no

man who is not an utter fool and coward is afraid of death itself but he is

afraid of doing wrong for to go to the world below having ones soul

full of injustice is the last and worst of all evils and in proof of what i

say if you have no objection i should like to tell you a story




callicles very well proceed and then we shall have done




socrates listen then as storytellers say to a very pretty tale which i

dare say that you may be disposed to regard as a fable only but which as i

believe is a true tale for i mean to speak the truth homer tells us il

how zeus and poseidon and pluto divided the empire which they inherited from

their father now in the days of cronos there existed a law respecting the

destiny of man which has always been and still continues to be in

heaventhat he who has lived all his life in justice and holiness shall

go when he is dead to the islands of the blessed and dwell there in perfect

happiness out of the reach of evil but that he who has lived unjustly and

impiously shall go to the house of vengeance and punishment which is called

tartarus and in the time of cronos and even quite lately in the reign of

zeus the judgment was given on the very day on which the men were to die the

judges were alive and the men were alive and the consequence was that the

judgments were not well given then pluto and the authorities from the islands

of the blessed came to zeus and said that the souls found their way to the

wrong places zeus said i shall put a stop to this the judgments are

not well given because the persons who are judged have their clothes on for

they are alive and there are many who having evil souls are apparelled in

fair bodies or encased in wealth or rank and when the day of judgment

arrives numerous witnesses come forward and testify on their behalf that they

have lived righteously the judges are awed by them and they themselves too

have their clothes on when judging their eyes and ears and their whole bodies

are interposed as a veil before their own souls all this is a hindrance to

them there are the clothes of the judges and the clothes of the

judgedwhat is to be done i will tell youin the first place i

will deprive men of the foreknowledge of death which they possess at present

this power which they have prometheus has already received my orders to take

from them in the second place they shall be entirely stripped before they are

judged for they shall be judged when they are dead and the judge too shall be

naked that is to say deadhe with his naked soul shall pierce into the

other naked souls and they shall die suddenly and be deprived of all their

kindred and leave their brave attire strewn upon the earthconducted in

this manner the judgment will be just i knew all about the matter before any

of you and therefore i have made my sons judges two from asia minos and

rhadamanthus and one from europe aeacus and these when they are dead shall

give judgment in the meadow at the parting of the ways whence the two roads

lead one to the islands of the blessed and the other to tartarus

rhadamanthus shall judge those who come from asia and aeacus those who come

from europe and to minos i shall give the primacy and he shall hold a court

of appeal in case either of the two others are in any doubtthen the

judgment respecting the last journey of men will be as just as possible




from this tale callicles which i have heard and believe i draw the following

inferencesdeath if i am right is in the first place the separation

from one another of two things soul and body nothing else and after they are

separated they retain their several natures as in life the body keeps the

same habit and the results of treatment or accident are distinctly visible in

it for example he who by nature or training or both was a tall man while he

was alive will remain as he was after he is dead and the fat man will remain

fat and so on and the dead man who in life had a fancy to have flowing hair

will have flowing hair and if he was marked with the whip and had the prints

of the scourge or of wounds in him when he was alive you might see the same

in the dead body and if his limbs were broken or misshapen when he was alive

the same appearance would be visible in the dead and in a word whatever was

the habit of the body during life would be distinguishable after death either

perfectly or in a great measure and for a certain time and i should imagine

that this is equally true of the soul callicles when a man is stripped of the

body all the natural or acquired affections of the soul are laid open to

viewand when they come to the judge as those from asia come to

rhadamanthus he places them near him and inspects them quite impartially not

knowing whose the soul is perhaps he may lay hands on the soul of the great

king or of some other king or potentate who has no soundness in him but his

soul is marked with the whip and is full of the prints and scars of perjuries

and crimes with which each action has stained him and he is all crooked with

falsehood and imposture and has no straightness because he has lived without

truth him rhadamanthus beholds full of all deformity and disproportion which

is caused by licence and luxury and insolence and incontinence and despatches

him ignominiously to his prison and there he undergoes the punishment which he

deserves




now the proper office of punishment is twofold he who is rightly punished

ought either to become better and profit by it or he ought to be made an

example to his fellows that they may see what he suffers and fear and become

better those who are improved when they are punished by gods and men are

those whose sins are curable and they are improved as in this world so also

in another by pain and suffering for there is no other way in which they can

be delivered from their evil but they who have been guilty of the worst

crimes and are incurable by reason of their crimes are made examples for as

they are incurable the time has passed at which they can receive any benefit

they get no good themselves but others get good when they behold them enduring

for ever the most terrible and painful and fearful sufferings as the penalty of

their sinsthere they are hanging up as examples in the prisonhouse of

the world below a spectacle and a warning to all unrighteous men who come

thither and among them as i confidently affirm will be found archelaus if

polus truly reports of him and any other tyrant who is like him of these

fearful examples most as i believe are taken from the class of tyrants and

kings and potentates and public men for they are the authors of the greatest

and most impious crimes because they have the power and homer witnesses to

the truth of this for they are always kings and potentates whom he has

described as suffering everlasting punishment in the world below such were

tantalus and sisyphus and tityus but no one ever described thersites or any

private person who was a villain as suffering everlasting punishment or as

incurable for to commit the worst crimes as i am inclined to think was not

in his power and he was happier than those who had the power no callicles

the very bad men come from the class of those who have power compare

republic and yet in that very class there may arise good men and worthy of

all admiration they are for where there is great power to do wrong to live

and to die justly is a hard thing and greatly to be praised and few there are

who attain to this such good and true men however there have been and will

be again at athens and in other states who have fulfilled their trust

righteously and there is one who is quite famous all over hellas aristeides

the son of lysimachus but in general great men are also bad my friend




as i was saying rhadamanthus when he gets a soul of the bad kind knows

nothing about him neither who he is nor who his parents are he knows only

that he has got hold of a villain and seeing this he stamps him as curable or

incurable and sends him away to tartarus whither he goes and receives his

proper recompense or again he looks with admiration on the soul of some just

one who has lived in holiness and truth he may have been a private man or not

and i should say callicles that he is most likely to have been a philosopher

who has done his own work and not troubled himself with the doings of other

men in his lifetime him rhadamanthus sends to the islands of the blessed

aeacus does the same and they both have sceptres and judge but minos alone

has a golden sceptre and is seated looking on as odysseus in homer declares

that he saw him




holding a sceptre of gold and giving laws to the dead




now i callicles am persuaded of the truth of these things and i consider how

i shall present my soul whole and undefiled before the judge in that day

renouncing the honours at which the world aims i desire only to know the

truth and to live as well as i can and when i die to die as well as i can

and to the utmost of my power i exhort all other men to do the same and in

return for your exhortation of me i exhort you also to take part in the great

combat which is the combat of life and greater than every other earthly

conflict and i retort your reproach of me and say that you will not be able

to help yourself when the day of trial and judgment of which i was speaking

comes upon you you will go before the judge the son of aegina and when he

has got you in his grip and is carrying you off you will gape and your head

will swim round just as mine would in the courts of this world and very

likely some one will shamefully box you on the ears and put upon you any sort

of insult




perhaps this may appear to you to be only an old wifes tale which you

will contemn and there might be reason in your contemning such tales if by

searching we could find out anything better or truer but now you see that you

and polus and gorgias who are the three wisest of the greeks of our day are

not able to show that we ought to live any life which does not profit in

another world as well as in this and of all that has been said nothing

remains unshaken but the saying that to do injustice is more to be avoided

than to suffer injustice and that the reality and not the appearance of virtue

is to be followed above all things as well in public as in private life and

that when any one has been wrong in anything he is to be chastised and that

the next best thing to a man being just is that he should become just and be

chastised and punished also that he should avoid all flattery of himself as

well as of others of the few or of the many and rhetoric and any other art

should be used by him and all his actions should be done always with a view

to justice




follow me then and i will lead you where you will be happy in life and after

death as the argument shows and never mind if some one despises you as a

fool and insults you if he has a mind let him strike you by zeus and do

you be of good cheer and do not mind the insulting blow for you will never

come to any harm in the practice of virtue if you are a really good and true

man when we have practised virtue together we will apply ourselves to

politics if that seems desirable or we will advise about whatever else may

      introduction and analysis

    


      of all the writings of plato the timaeus is the most obscure and repulsive

      to the modern reader and has nevertheless had the greatest influence over

      the ancient and mediaeval world the obscurity arises in the infancy of

      physical science out of the confusion of theological mathematical and

      physiological notions out of the desire to conceive the whole of nature

      without any adequate knowledge of the parts and from a greater perception

      of similarities which lie on the surface than of differences which are

      hidden from view to bring sense under the control of reason to find some

      way through the mist or labyrinth of appearances either the highway of

      mathematics or more devious paths suggested by the analogy of man with

      the world and of the world with man to see that all things have a cause

      and are tending towards an endthis is the spirit of the ancient

      physical philosopher he has no notion of trying an experiment and is

      hardly capable of observing the curiosities of nature which are tumbling

      out at his feet or of interpreting even the most obvious of them he is

      driven back from the nearer to the more distant from particulars to

      generalities from the earth to the stars he lifts up his eyes to the

      heavens and seeks to guide by their motions his erring footsteps but we

      neither appreciate the conditions of knowledge to which he was subjected

      nor have the ideas which fastened upon his imagination the same hold upon

      us for he is hanging between matter and mind he is under the dominion at

      the same time both of sense and of abstractions his impressions are taken

      almost at random from the outside of nature he sees the light but not

      the objects which are revealed by the light and he brings into

      juxtaposition things which to us appear wide as the poles asunder because

      he finds nothing between them he passes abruptly from persons to ideas

      and numbers and from ideas and numbers to personsfrom the heavens

      to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not

      distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming

      of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense he contrasts the perfect

      movements of the heavenly bodies with the imperfect representation of them

      rep and he does not always require strict accuracy even in

      applications of number and figure rep his mind lingers around the

      forms of mythology which he uses as symbols or translates into figures of

      speech he has no implements of observation such as the telescope or

      microscope the great science of chemistry is a blank to him it is only

      by an effort that the modern thinker can breathe the atmosphere of the

      ancient philosopher or understand how under such unequal conditions he

      seems in many instances by a sort of inspiration to have anticipated the

      truth

    


      the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly

      to a misunderstanding in the supposed depths of this dialogue the

      neoplatonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and

      christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at

      variance with the spirit of plato believing that he was inspired by the

      holy ghost or had received his wisdom from moses they seemed to find in

      his writings the christian trinity the word the church the creation of

      the world in a jewish sense as they really found the personality of god

      or of mind and the immortality of the soul all religions and

      philosophies met and mingled in the schools of alexandria and the

      neoplatonists had a method of interpretation which could elicit any

      meaning out of any words they were really incapable of distinguishing

      between the opinions of one philosopher and another between

      aristotle and plato or between the serious thoughts of plato and his

      passing fancies they were absorbed in his theology and were under the

      dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly

      characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was

      not understood by them at all yet the genius of plato and greek

      philosophy reacted upon the east and a greek element of thought and

      language overlaid and partly reduced to order the chaos of orientalism

      and kindred spirits like st augustine even though they were acquainted

      with his writings only through the medium of a latin translation were

      profoundly affected by them seeming to find god and his word everywhere

      insinuated in them august confess

    


      there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into

      the absurdities of the neoplatonists in the present day we are well

      aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by

      the contemporary history of thought we know that mysticism is not

      criticism the fancies of the neoplatonists are only interesting to us

      because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in

      the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our

      own day but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and

      in spirit they are opposed to him they are the feeble expression of an

      age which has lost the power not only of creating great works but of

      understanding them they are the spurious birth of a marriage between

      philosophy and tradition between hellas and the eastgreek

      rep whereas the socalled mysticism of plato is purely greek arising

      out of his imperfect knowledge and high aspirations and is the growth of

      an age in which philosophy is not wholly separated from poetry and

      mythology

    


      a greater danger with modern interpreters of plato is the tendency to

      regard the timaeus as the centre of his system we do not know how plato

      would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging

      any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected

      was ever present to his mind but if he had arranged them there are many

      indications that this is not the place which he would have assigned to the

      timaeus we observe first of all that the dialogue is put into the mouth

      of a pythagorean philosopher and not of socrates and this is required by

      dramatic propriety for the investigation of nature was expressly

      renounced by socrates in the phaedo nor does plato himself attribute any

      importance to his guesses at science he is not at all absorbed by them

      as he is by the idea of good he is modest and hesitating and confesses

      that his words partake of the uncertainty of the subject tim the

      dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under

      this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals

      but we can hardly suppose that plato would have preferred the study of

      nature to man or that he would have deemed the formation of the world and

      the human frame to have the same interest which he ascribes to the mystery

      of being and notbeing or to the great political problems which he

      discusses in the republic and the laws there are no speculations on

      physics in the other dialogues of plato and he himself regards the

      consideration of them as a rational pastime only he is beginning to feel

      the need of further divisions of knowledge and is becoming aware that

      besides dialectic mathematics and the arts there is another field which

      has been hitherto unexplored by him but he has not as yet defined this

      intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and

      mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in

      ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing

      the body before the soul

    


      it is true however that the timaeus is by no means confined to

      speculations on physics the deeper foundations of the platonic

      philosophy such as the nature of god the distinction of the sensible and

      intellectual the great original conceptions of time and space also

      appear in it they are found principally in the first half of the

      dialogue the construction of the heavens is for the most part ideal the

      cyclic year serves as the connection between the world of absolute being

      and of generation just as the number of population in the republic is the

      expression or symbol of the transition from the ideal to the actual state

      in some passages we are uncertain whether we are reading a description of

      astronomical facts or contemplating processes of the human mind or of

      that divine mind phil which in plato is hardly separable from it the

      characteristics of man are transferred to the worldanimal as for example

      when intelligence and knowledge are said to be perfected by the circle of

      the same and true opinion by the circle of the other and conversely the

      motions of the worldanimal reappear in man its amorphous state continues

      in the child and in both disorder and chaos are gradually succeeded by

      stability and order it is not however to passages like these that plato

      is referring when he speaks of the uncertainty of his subject but rather

      to the composition of bodies to the relations of colours the nature of

      diseases and the like about which he truly feels the lamentable

      ignorance prevailing in his own age

    


      we are led by plato himself to regard the timaeus not as the centre or

      inmost shrine of the edifice but as a detached building in a different

      style framed not after the socratic but after some pythagorean model

      as in the cratylus and parmenides we are uncertain whether plato is

      expressing his own opinions or appropriating and perhaps improving the

      philosophical speculations of others in all three dialogues he is

      exerting his dramatic and imitative power in the cratylus mingling a

      satirical and humorous purpose with true principles of language in the

      parmenides overthrowing megarianism by a sort of ultramegarianism which

      discovers contradictions in the one as great as those which have been

      previously shown to exist in the ideas there is a similar uncertainty

      about the timaeus in the first part he scales the heights of

      transcendentalism in the latter part he treats in a bald and superficial

      manner of the functions and diseases of the human frame he uses the

      thoughts and almost the words of parmenides when he discourses of being

      and of essence adopting from old religion into philosophy the conception

      of god and from the megarians the idea of good he agrees with empedocles

      and the atomists in attributing the greater differences of kinds to the

      figures of the elements and their movements into and out of one another

      with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he

      asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of

      necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he

      supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number many if not

      all the elements of the presocratic philosophy are included in the

      timaeus it is a composite or eclectic work of imagination in which

      plato without naming them gathers up into a kind of system the various

      elements of philosophy which preceded him

    


      if we allow for the difference of subject and for some growth in platos

      own mind the discrepancy between the timaeus and the other dialogues will

      not appear to be great it is probable that the relation of the ideas to

      god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different

      times of his life in all his later dialogues we observe a tendency in him

      to personify mind or god and he therefore naturally inclines to view

      creation as the work of design the creator is like a human artist who

      frames in his mind a plan which he executes by the help of his servants

      thus the language of philosophy which speaks of first and second causes is

      crossed by another sort of phraseology god made the world because he was

      good and the demons ministered to him the timaeus is cast in a more

      theological and less philosophical mould than the other dialogues but the

      same general spirit is apparent there is the same dualism or opposition

      between the ideal and actualthe soul is prior to the body the

      intelligible and unseen to the visible and corporeal there is the same

      distinction between knowledge and opinion which occurs in the theaetetus

      and republic the same enmity to the poets the same combination of music

      and gymnastics the doctrine of transmigration is still held by him as in

      the phaedrus and republic and the soul has a view of the heavens in a

      prior state of being the ideas also remain but they have become types in

      nature forms of men animals birds fishes and the attribution of evil

      to physical causes accords with the doctrine which he maintains in the

      laws respecting the involuntariness of vice

    


      the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of

      the platonic dialogues the language is weighty abrupt and in some

      passages sublime but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument

      which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium nothing can exceed the

      beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his

      accustomed manner but in the rest of the work the power of language seems

      to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up he could write in

      one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been

      fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena the

      early physiologists had generally written in verse the prose writers

      like democritus and anaxagoras as far as we can judge from their

      fragments never attained to a periodic style and hence we find the same

      sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the

      philosophical poem of lucretius there is a want of flow and often a

      defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater

      use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in platos earlier

      writings the sentences are less closely connected and also more involved

      the antecedents of demonstrative and relative pronouns are in some cases

      remote and perplexing the greater frequency of participles and of

      absolute constructions gives the effect of heaviness the descriptive

      portion of the timaeus retains traces of the first greek prose

      composition for the great master of language was speaking on a theme with

      which he was imperfectly acquainted and had no words in which to express

      his meaning the rugged grandeur of the opening discourse of timaeus may

      be compared with the more harmonious beauty of a similar passage in the

      phaedrus

    


      to the same cause we may attribute the want of plan plato had not the

      command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect

      work of art hence there are several new beginnings and resumptions and

      formal or artificial connections we miss the callida junctura of the

      earlier dialogues his speculations about the eternal his theories of

      creation his mathematical anticipations are supplemented by desultory

      remarks on the one immortal and the two mortal souls of man on the

      functions of the bodily organs in health and disease on sight hearing

      smell taste and touch he soars into the heavens and then as if his

      wings were suddenly clipped he walks ungracefully and with difficulty

      upon the earth the greatest things in the world and the least things in

      man are brought within the compass of a short treatise but the

      intermediate links are missing and we cannot be surprised that there

      should be a want of unity in a work which embraces astronomy theology

      physiology and natural philosophy in a few pages

    


      it is not easy to determine how platos cosmos may be presented to the

      reader in a clearer and shorter form or how we may supply a thread of

      connexion to his ideas without giving greater consistency to them than

      they possessed in his mind or adding on consequences which would never

      have occurred to him for he has glimpses of the truth but no

      comprehensive or perfect vision there are isolated expressions about the

      nature of god which have a wonderful depth and power but we are not

      justified in assuming that these had any greater significance to the mind

      of plato than language of a neutral and impersonal character with a

      view to the illustration of the timaeus i propose to divide this

      introduction into sections of which the first will contain an outline of

      the dialogue  i shall consider the aspects of nature which presented

      themselves to plato and his age and the elements of philosophy which

      entered into the conception of them  the theology and physics of the

      timaeus including the soul of the world the conception of time and

      space and the composition of the elements  in the fourth section i

      shall consider the platonic astronomy and the position of the earth

      there will remain  the psychology  the physiology of plato and

       his analysis of the senses to be briefly commented upon  lastly

      we may examine in what points plato approaches or anticipates the

      discoveries of modern science

    


 






      section 

    


      socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic he lightly

      touches upon a few pointsthe division of labour and distribution

      of the citizens into classes the double nature and training of the

      guardians the community of property and of women and children but he

      makes no mention of the second education or of the government of

      philosophers

    


      and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to

      know how she behaved in some great struggle but he is unable to invent

      such a narrative himself and he is afraid that the poets are equally

      incapable for although he pretends to have nothing to say against them

      he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators who can only describe what

      they have seen and he fears that the sophists who are plentifully

      supplied with graces of speech in their erratic way of life having never

      had a city or house of their own may through want of experience err in

      their conception of philosophers and statesmen and therefore to you i

      turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a

      statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly

      accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and

      education to share in our discourse

    


      hermocrates we will do our best and have been already preparing for on

      our way home critias told us of an ancient tradition which i wish

      critias that you would repeat to socrates i will if timaeus

      approves i approve listen then socrates to a tale of solons who

      being the friend of dropidas my greatgrandfather told it to my

      grandfather critias and he told me the narrative related to ancient

      famous actions of the athenian people and to one especially which i will

      rehearse in honour of you and of the goddess critias when he told this

      tale of the olden time was ninety years old i being not more than ten

      the occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the apaturia called the

      registration of youth at which our parents gave prizes for recitation

      some poems of solon were recited by the boys they had not at that time

      gone out of fashion and the recital of them led some one to say perhaps

      in compliment to critias that solon was not only the wisest of men but

      also the best of poets the old man brightened up at hearing this and

      said had solon only had the leisure which was required to complete the

      famous legend which he brought with him from egypt he would have been as

      distinguished as homer and hesiod and what was the subject of the poem

      said the person who made the remark the subject was a very noble one he

      described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever

      engaged but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the

      lapse of time and the extinction of the actors tell us said the other

      the whole story and where solon heard the story he repliedthere

      is at the head of the egyptian delta where the river nile divides a city

      and district called sais the city was the birthplace of king amasis and

      is under the protection of the goddess neith or athene the citizens have

      a friendly feeling towards the athenians believing themselves to be

      related to them hither came solon and was received with honour and here

      he first learnt by conversing with the egyptian priests how ignorant he

      and his countrymen were of antiquity perceiving this and with the view

      of eliciting information from them he told them the tales of phoroneus

      and niobe and also of deucalion and pyrrha and he endeavoured to count

      the generations which had since passed thereupon an aged priest said to

      him o solon solon you hellenes are ever young and there is no old man

      who is a hellene what do you mean he asked in mind replied the

      priest i mean to say that you are children there is no opinion or

      tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age and i will tell

      you why like the rest of mankind you have suffered from convulsions of

      nature which are chiefly brought about by the two great agencies of fire

      and water the former is symbolized in the hellenic tale of young phaethon

      who drove his fathers horses the wrong way and having burnt up the earth

      was himself burnt up by a thunderbolt for there occurs at long intervals

      a derangement of the heavenly bodies and then the earth is destroyed by

      fire at such times and when fire is the agent those who dwell by rivers

      or on the seashore are safer than those who dwell upon high and dry

      places who in their turn are safer when the danger is from water now the

      nile is our saviour from fire and as there is little rain in egypt we

      are not harmed by water whereas in other countries when a deluge comes

      the inhabitants are swept by the rivers into the sea the memorials which

      your own and other nations have once had of the famous actions of mankind

      perish in the waters at certain periods and the rude survivors in the

      mountains begin again knowing nothing of the world before the flood but

      in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered

      for ever in our temples the genealogies which you have recited to us out

      of your own annals solon are a mere childrens story for in the first

      place you remember one deluge only and there were many of them and you

      know nothing of that fairest and noblest race of which you are a seed or

      remnant the memory of them was lost because there was no written voice

      among you for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest

      and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution

      of any under the face of heaven solon marvelled and desired to be

      informed of the particulars you are welcome to hear them said the

      priest both for your own sake and for that of the city and above all

      for the sake of the goddess who is the common foundress of both our

      cities nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and

      eight thousand since she founded ours as our annals record many laws

      exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the

      olden time i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the

      account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers in the first

      place there was a caste of priests among the ancient athenians and

      another of artisans also castes of shepherds hunters and husbandmen

      and lastly of warriors who like the warriors of egypt were separated

      from the rest and carried shields and spears a custom which the goddess

      first taught you and then the asiatics and we among asiatics first

      received from her observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of

      wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to

      the use of man the spot of earth which the goddess chose had the best of

      climates and produced the wisest men in no other was she herself the

      philosopher and warrior goddess so likely to have votaries and there you

      dwelt as became the children of the gods excelling all men in virtue and

      many famous actions are recorded of you the most famous of them all was

      the overthrow of the island of atlantis this great island lay over

      against the pillars of heracles in extent greater than libya and asia put

      together and was the passage to other islands and to a great ocean of

      which the mediterranean sea was only the harbour and within the pillars

      the empire of atlantis reached in europe to tyrrhenia and in libya to

      egypt this mighty power was arrayed against egypt and hellas and all the

      countries bordering on the mediterranean then your city did bravely and

      won renown over the whole earth for at the peril of her own existence

      and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader

      and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars

      a little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods and

      your warrior race all sank into the earth and the great island of

      atlantis also disappeared in the sea this is the explanation of the

      shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean

    


      such was the tale socrates which critias heard from solon and i noticed

      when listening to you yesterday how close the resemblance was between

      your city and citizens and the ancient athenian state but i would not

      speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory i had heard the

      old man when i was a child and though i could not remember the whole of

      our yesterdays discourse i was able to recall every word of this which

      is branded into my mind and i am prepared socrates to rehearse to you

      the entire narrative the imaginary state which you were describing may be

      identified with the reality of solon and our antediluvian ancestors may

      be your citizens that is excellent critias and very appropriate to a

      panathenaic festival the truth of the story is a great advantage then

      now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus

      who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going

      down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has

      created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce

      them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record

      spoke as the law of solon prescribes we will bring them into court and

      acknowledge their claims to citizenship i see replied socrates that

      i shall be well entertained and do you timaeus offer up a prayer and

      begin

    


      timaeus all men who have any right feeling at the beginning of any

      enterprise call upon the gods and he who is about to speak of the origin

      of the universe has a special need of their aid may my words be

      acceptable to them and may i speak in the manner which will be most

      intelligible to you and will best express my own meaning

    


      first i must distinguish between that which always is and never becomes

      and which is apprehended by reason and reflection and that which always

      becomes and never is and is conceived by opinion with the help of sense

      all that becomes and is created is the work of a cause and that is fair

      which the artificer makes after an eternal pattern but whatever is

      fashioned after a created pattern is not fair is the world created or

      uncreatedthat is the first question created i reply being

      visible and tangible and having a body and therefore sensible and if

      sensible then created and if created made by a cause and the cause is

      the ineffable father of all things who had before him an eternal

      archetype for to imagine that the archetype was created would be

      blasphemy seeing that the world is the noblest of creations and god is

      the best of causes and the world being thus created according to the

      eternal pattern is the copy of something and we may assume that words are

      akin to the matter of which they speak what is spoken of the unchanging

      or intelligible must be certain and true but what is spoken of the

      created image can only be probable being is to becoming what truth is to

      belief and amid the variety of opinions which have arisen about god and

      the nature of the world we must be content to take probability for our

      rule considering that i who am the speaker and you who are the judges

      are only men to probability we may attain but no further

    


      socrates excellent timaeus i like your manner of approaching the

      subjectproceed

    


      timaeus why did the creator make the worldhe was good and therefore

      not jealous and being free from jealousy he desired that all things

      should be like himself wherefore he set in order the visible world which

      he found in disorder now he who is the best could only create the

      fairest and reflecting that of visible things the intelligent is superior

      to the unintelligent he put intelligence in soul and soul in body and

      framed the universe to be the best and fairest work in the order of

      nature and the world became a living soul through the providence of god

    


      in the likeness of what animal was the world madethat is the third

      questionthe form of the perfect animal was a whole and contained all

      intelligible beings and the visible animal made after the pattern of

      this included all visible creatures

    


      are there many worlds or one onlythat is the fourth questionone

      only for if in the original there had been more than one they would have

      been the parts of a third which would have been the true pattern of the

      world and therefore there is and will ever be but one created world

      now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and

      tangiblevisible and therefore made of firetangible and

      therefore solid and made of earth but two terms must be united by a

      third which is a mean between them and had the earth been a surface

      only one mean would have sufficed but two means are required to unite

      solid bodies and as the world was composed of solids between the

      elements of fire and earth god placed two other elements of air and water

      and arranged them in a continuous proportion

    


      fireairairwater and airwaterwaterearth

    


      and so put together a visible and palpable heaven having harmony and

      friendship in the union of the four elements and being at unity with

      itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer each of the

      elements was taken into the universe whole and entire for he considered

      that the animal should be perfect and one leaving no remnants out of

      which another animal could be created and should also be free from old

      age and disease which are produced by the action of external forces and

      as he was to contain all things he was made in the allcontaining form of

      a sphere round as from a lathe and every way equidistant from the centre

      as was natural and suitable to him he was finished and smooth having

      neither eyes nor ears for there was nothing without him which he could

      see or hear and he had no need to carry food to his mouth nor was there

      air for him to breathe and he did not require hands for there was

      nothing of which he could take hold nor feet with which to walk all

      that he did was done rationally in and by himself and he moved in a

      circle turning within himself which is the most intellectual of motions

      but the other six motions were wanting to him wherefore the universe had

      no feet or legs

    


      and so the thought of god made a god in the image of a perfect body

      having intercourse with himself and needing no other but in every part

      harmonious and selfcontained and truly blessed the soul was first made

      by himthe elder to rule the younger not in the order in which our

      wayward fancy has led us to describe them but the soul first and

      afterwards the body god took of the unchangeable and indivisible and also

      of the divisible and corporeal and out of the two he made a third nature

      essence which was in a mean between them and partook of the same and the

      other the intractable nature of the other being compressed into the same

      having made a compound of all the three he proceeded to divide the entire

      mass into portions related to one another in the ratios of     

        and proceeded to fill up the double and triple intervals thus

    


   over     over     over      over 

   over       over     over     over 




      in which double series of numbers are two kinds of means the one exceeds

      and is exceeded by equal parts of the extremes eg    the other

      kind of mean is one which is equidistant from the extremes  

      in this manner there were formed intervals of thirds  of fourths

       and of ninths  and next he filled up the intervals of a fourth

      with ninths leaving a remnant which is in the ratio of  the

      entire compound was divided by him lengthways into two parts which he

      united at the centre like the letter x and bent into an inner and outer

      circle or sphere cutting one another again at a point over against the

      point at which they cross the outer circle or sphere was named the sphere

      of the samethe inner the sphere of the other or diverse and the

      one revolved horizontally to the right the other diagonally to the left

      to the sphere of the same which was undivided he gave dominion but the

      sphere of the other or diverse was distributed into seven unequal orbits

      having intervals in ratios of twos and threes three of either sort and

      he bade the orbits move in opposite directions to one anotherthree

      of them the sun mercury venus with equal swiftness and the remaining

      fourthe moon saturn mars jupiter with unequal swiftness to the

      three and to one another but all in due proportion

    


      when the creator had made the soul he made the body within her and the

      soul interfused everywhere from the centre to the circumference of heaven

      herself turning in herself began a divine life of rational and

      everlasting motion the body of heaven is visible but the soul is

      invisible and partakes of reason and harmony and is the best of

      creations being the work of the best and being composed of the same the

      other and the essence these three and also divided and bound in

      harmonical proportion and revolving within herselfthe soul when

      touching anything which has essence whether divided or undivided is

      stirred to utter the sameness or diversity of that and some other thing

      and to tell how and when and where individuals are affected or related

      whether in the world of change or of essence when reason is in the

      neighbourhood of sense and the circle of the other or diverse is moving

      truly then arise true opinions and beliefs when reason is in the sphere

      of thought and the circle of the same runs smoothly then intelligence is

      perfected

    


      when the father who begat the world saw the image which he had made of the

      eternal gods moving and living he rejoiced and in his joy resolved

      since the archetype was eternal to make the creature eternal as far as

      this was possible wherefore he made an image of eternity which is time

      having an uniform motion according to number parted into months and days

      and years and also having greater divisions of past present and future

      these all apply to becoming in time and have no meaning in relation to

      the eternal nature which ever is and never was or will be for the

      unchangeable is never older or younger and when we say that he was or

      will be we are mistaken for these words are applicable only to

      becoming and not to true being and equally wrong are we in saying that

      what has become is become and that what becomes is becoming and that the

      nonexistent is nonexistentthese are the forms of time which imitate

      eternity and move in a circle measured by number

    


      thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature and it was created

      together with the heavens in order that if they were dissolved it might

      perish with them and god made the sun and moon and five other wanderers

      as they are called seven in all and to each of them he gave a body

      moving in an orbit being one of the seven orbits into which the circle of

      the other was divided he put the moon in the orbit which was nearest to

      the earth the sun in that next the morning star and mercury in the

      orbits which move opposite to the sun but with equal swiftnessthis

      being the reason why they overtake and are overtaken by one another all

      these bodies became living creatures and learnt their appointed tasks

      and began to move the nearer more swiftly the remoter more slowly

      according to the diagonal movement of the other and since this was

      controlled by the movement of the same the seven planets in their courses

      appeared to describe spirals and that appeared fastest which was slowest

      and that which overtook others appeared to be overtaken by them and god

      lighted a fire in the second orbit from the earth which is called the sun

      to give light over the whole heaven and to teach intelligent beings that

      knowledge of number which is derived from the revolution of the same thus

      arose day and night which are the periods of the most intelligent nature

      a month is created by the revolution of the moon a year by that of the

      sun other periods of wonderful length and complexity are not observed by

      men in general there is moreover a cycle or perfect year at the

      completion of which they all meet and coincideto this end the stars

      came into being that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature

    


      thus far the universal animal was made in the divine image but the other

      animals were not as yet included in him and god created them according to

      the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original

      there are four of them one of gods another of birds a third of fishes

      and a fourth of animals the gods were made in the form of a circle which

      is the most perfect figure and the figure of the universe they were

      created chiefly of fire that they might be bright and were made to know

      and follow the best and to be scattered over the heavens of which they

      were to be the glory two kinds of motion were assigned to themfirst

      the revolution in the same and around the same in peaceful unchanging

      thought of the same and to this was added a forward motion which was

      under the control of the same thus then the fixed stars were created

      being divine and eternal animals revolving on the same spot and the

      wandering stars in their courses were created in the manner already

      described the earth which is our nurse clinging around the pole

      extended through the universe he made to be the guardian and artificer of

      night and day first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of

      heaven vain would be the labour of telling all the figures of them

      moving as in dance and their juxtapositions and approximations and when

      and where and behind what other stars they appear to disappearto

      tell of all this without looking at a plan of them would be labour in

      vain

    


      the knowledge of the other gods is beyond us and we can only accept the

      traditions of the ancients who were the children of the gods as they

      said for surely they must have known their own ancestors although they

      give no proof we must believe them as is customary they tell us that

      oceanus and tethys were the children of earth and heaven that phoreys

      cronos and rhea came in the next generation and were followed by zeus

      and here whose brothers and children are known to everybody

    


      when all of them both those who show themselves in the sky and those who

      retire from view had come into being the creator addressed them thusgods

      sons of gods my works if i will are indissoluble that which is bound

      may be dissolved but only an evil being would dissolve that which is

      harmonious and happy and although you are not immortal you shall not die

      for i will hold you together hear me thenthree tribes of mortal

      beings have still to be created but if created by me they would be like

      gods do ye therefore make them i will implant in them the seed of

      immortality and you shall weave together the mortal and immortal and

      provide food for them and receive them again in death thus he spake

      and poured the remains of the elements into the cup in which he had

      mingled the soul of the universe they were no longer pure as before but

      diluted and the mixture he distributed into souls equal in number to the

      stars and assigned each to a starthen having mounted them as in a

      chariot he showed them the nature of the universe and told them of their

      future birth and human lot they were to be sown in the planets and out

      of them was to come forth the most religious of animals which would

      hereafter be called man the souls were to be implanted in bodies which

      were in a perpetual flux whence he said would arise first sensation

      secondly love which is a mixture of pleasure and pain thirdly fear and

      anger and the opposite affections and if they conquered these they

      would live righteously but if they were conquered by them unrighteously

      he who lived well would return to his native star and would there have a

      blessed existence but if he lived ill he would pass into the nature of

      a woman and if he did not then alter his evil ways into the likeness of

      some animal until the reason which was in him reasserted her sway over

      the elements of fire air earth water which had engrossed her and he

      regained his first and better nature having given this law to his

      creatures that he might be guiltless of their future evil he sowed them

      some in the earth some in the moon and some in the other planets and he

      ordered the younger gods to frame human bodies for them and to make the

      necessary additions to them and to avert from them all but selfinflicted

      evil

    


      having given these commands the creator remained in his own nature and

      his children receiving from him the immortal principle borrowed from the

      world portions of earth air fire water hereafter to be returned which

      they fastened together not with the adamantine bonds which bound

      themselves but by little invisible pegs making each separate body out of

      all the elements subject to influx and efflux and containing the courses

      of the soul these swelling and surging as in a river moved irregularly

      and irrationally in all the six possible ways forwards backwards right

      left up and down but violent as were the internal and alimentary fluids

      the tide became still more violent when the body came into contact with

      flaming fire or the solid earth or gliding waters or the stormy wind

      the motions produced by these impulses pass through the body to the soul

      and have the name of sensations uniting with the everflowing current

      they shake the courses of the soul stopping the revolution of the same

      and twisting in all sorts of ways the nature of the other and the

      harmonical ratios of twos and threes and the mean terms which connect

      them until the circles are bent and disordered and their motion becomes

      irregular you may imagine a position of the body in which the head is

      resting upon the ground and the legs are in the air and the top is

      bottom and the left right and something similar happens when the

      disordered motions of the soul come into contact with any external thing

      they say the same or the other in a manner which is the very opposite of

      the truth and they are false and foolish and have no guiding principle

      in them and when external impressions enter in they are really

      conquered though they seem to conquer

    


      by reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence

      but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates and the courses of the

      soul regain their proper motion and apprehend the same and the other

      rightly and become rational the soul of him who has education is whole

      and perfect and escapes the worst disease but if a mans education be

      neglected he walks lamely through life and returns good for nothing to

      the world below this however is an afterstageat present we are

      only concerned with the creation of the body and soul

    


      the two divine courses were encased by the gods in a sphere which is

      called the head and is the god and lord of us and to this they gave the

      body to be a vehicle and the members to be instruments having the power

      of flexion and extension such was the origin of legs and arms in the

      next place the gods gave a forward motion to the human body because the

      front part of man was the more honourable and had authority and they put

      in a face in which they inserted organs to minister in all things to the

      providence of the soul they first contrived the eyes into which they

      conveyed a light akin to the light of day making it flow through the

      pupils when the light of the eye is surrounded by the light of day then

      like falls upon like and they unite and form one body which conveys to

      the soul the motions of visible objects but when the visual ray goes

      forth into the darkness then unlike falls upon unlikethe eye no

      longer sees and we go to sleep the fire or light when kept in by the

      eyelids equalizes the inward motions and there is rest accompanied by

      few dreams only when the greater motions remain they engender in us

      corresponding visions of the night and now we shall be able to understand

      the nature of reflections in mirrors the fires from within and from

      without meet about the smooth and bright surface of the mirror and

      because they meet in a manner contrary to the usual mode the right and

      left sides of the object are transposed in a concave mirror the top and

      bottom are inverted but this is no transposition

    


      these are the second causes which god used as his ministers in fashioning

      the world they are thought by many to be the prime causes but they are

      not so for they are destitute of mind and reason and the lover of mind

      will not allow that there are any prime causes other than the rational and

      invisible onesthese he investigates first and afterwards the

      causes of things which are moved by others and which work by chance and

      without order of the second or concurrent causes of sight i have already

      spoken and i will now speak of the higher purpose of god in giving us

      eyes sight is the source of the greatest benefits to us for if our eyes

      had never seen the sun stars and heavens the words which we have spoken

      would not have been uttered the sight of them and their revolutions has

      given us the knowledge of number and time the power of enquiry and

      philosophy which is the great blessing of human life not to speak of the

      lesser benefits which even the vulgar can appreciate god gave us the

      faculty of sight that we might behold the order of the heavens and create

      a corresponding order in our own erring minds to the like end the gifts

      of speech and hearing were bestowed upon us not for the sake of

      irrational pleasure but in order that we might harmonize the courses of

      the soul by sympathy with the harmony of sound and cure ourselves of our

      irregular and graceless ways

    


      thus far we have spoken of the works of mind and there are other works

      done from necessity which we must now place beside them for the creation

      is made up of both mind persuading necessity as far as possible to work

      out good before the heavens there existed fire air water earth which

      we suppose men to know though no one has explained their nature and we

      erroneously maintain them to be the letters or elements of the whole

      although they cannot reasonably be compared even to syllables or first

      compounds i am not now speaking of the first principles of things

      because i cannot discover them by our present mode of enquiry but as i

      observed the rule of probability at first i will begin anew seeking by

      the grace of god to observe it still

    


      in our former discussion i distinguished two kinds of beingthe

      unchanging or invisible and the visible or changing but now a third kind

      is required which i shall call the receptacle or nurse of generation

      there is a difficulty in arriving at an exact notion of this third kind

      because the four elements themselves are of inexact natures and easily

      pass into one another and are too transient to be detained by any one

      name wherefore we are compelled to speak of water or fire not as

      substances but as qualities they may be compared to images made of gold

      which are continually assuming new forms somebody asks what they are if

      you do not know the safest answer is to reply that they are gold in like

      manner there is a universal nature out of which all things are made and

      which is like none of them but they enter into and pass out of her and

      are made after patterns of the true in a wonderful and inexplicable

      manner the containing principle may be likened to a mother the source or

      spring to a father the intermediate nature to a child and we may also

      remark that the matter which receives every variety of form must be

      formless like the inodorous liquids which are prepared to receive scents

      or the smooth and soft materials on which figures are impressed in the

      same way space or matter is neither earth nor fire nor air nor water but

      an invisible and formless being which receives all things and in an

      incomprehensible manner partakes of the intelligible but we may say

      speaking generally that fire is that part of this nature which is

      inflamed water that which is moistened and the like

    


      let me ask a question in which a great principle is involved is there an

      essence of fire and the other elements or are there only fires visible to

      sense i answer in a word if mind is one thing and true opinion another

      then there are selfexistent essences but if mind is the same with

      opinion then the visible and corporeal is most real but they are not the

      same and they have a different origin and nature the one comes to us by

      instruction the other by persuasion the one is rational the other is

      irrational the one is movable by persuasion the other immovable the one

      is possessed by every man the other by the gods and by very few men and

      we must acknowledge that as there are two kinds of knowledge so there are

      two kinds of being corresponding to them the one uncreated

      indestructible immovable which is seen by intelligence only the other

      created which is always becoming in place and vanishing out of place and

      is apprehended by opinion and sense there is also a third naturethat

      of space which is indestructible and is perceived by a kind of spurious

      reason without the help of sense this is presented to us in a dreamy

      manner and yet is said to be necessary for we say that all things must

      be somewhere in space for they are the images of other things and must

      therefore have a separate existence and exist in something ie in

      space but true reason assures us that while two things ie the idea

      and the image are different they cannot inhere in one another so as to

      be one and two at the same time

    


      to sum up being and generation and space these three existed before the

      heavens and the nurse or vessel of generation moistened by water and

      inflamed by fire and taking the forms of air and earth assumed various

      shapes by the motion of the vessel the elements were divided and like

      grain winnowed by fans the close and heavy particles settled in one

      place the light and airy ones in another at first they were without

      reason and measure and had only certain faint traces of themselves until

      god fashioned them by figure and number in this as in every other part

      of creation i suppose god to have made things as far as was possible

      fair and good out of things not fair and good

    


      and now i will explain to you the generation of the world by a method with

      which your scientific training will have made you familiar fire air

      earth and water are bodies and therefore solids and solids are contained

      in planes and plane rectilinear figures are made up of triangles of

      triangles there are two kinds one having the opposite sides equal

      isosceles the other with unequal sides scalene these we may fairly

      assume to be the original elements of fire and the other bodies what

      principles are prior to these god only knows and he of men whom god

      loves next we must determine what are the four most beautiful figures

      which are unlike one another and yet sometimes capable of resolution into

      one anotherof the two kinds of triangles the equalsided has but one

      form the unequalsided has an infinite variety of forms and there is

      none more beautiful than that which forms the half of an equilateral

      triangle let us then choose two triangles one the isosceles the other

      that form of scalene which has the square of the longer side three times

      as great as the square of the lesser side and affirm that out of these

      fire and the other elements have been constructed

    


      i was wrong in imagining that all the four elements could be generated

      into and out of one another for as they are formed three of them from

      the triangle which has the sides unequal the fourth from the triangle

      which has equal sides three can be resolved into one another but the

      fourth cannot be resolved into them nor they into it so much for their

      passage into one another i must now speak of their construction from the

      triangle of which the hypotenuse is twice the lesser side the three first

      regular solids are formedfirst the equilateral pyramid or

      tetrahedron secondly the octahedron thirdly the icosahedron and from

      the isosceles triangle is formed the cube and there is a fifth figure

      which is made out of twelve pentagons the dodecahedronthis god

      used as a model for the twelvefold division of the zodiac

    


      let us now assign the geometrical forms to their respective elements the

      cube is the most stable of them because resting on a quadrangular plane

      surface and composed of isosceles triangles to the earth then which is

      the most stable of bodies and the most easily modelled of them may be

      assigned the form of a cube and the remaining forms to the other

      elementsto fire the pyramid to air the octahedron and to water

      the icosahedronaccording to their degrees of lightness or

      heaviness or power or want of power of penetration the single particles

      of any of the elements are not seen by reason of their smallness they

      only become visible when collected the ratios of their motions numbers

      and other properties are ordered by the god who harmonized them as far

      as necessity permitted

    


      the probable conclusion is as followsearth when dissolved by the

      more penetrating element of fire whether acting immediately or through

      the medium of air or water is decomposed but not transformed water when

      divided by fire or air becomes one part fire and two parts air a volume

      of air divided becomes two of fire on the other hand when condensed two

      volumes of fire make a volume of air and two and a half parts of air

      condense into one of water any element which is fastened upon by fire is

      cut by the sharpness of the triangles until at length coalescing with

      the fire it is at rest for similars are not affected by similars when

      two kinds of bodies quarrel with one another then the tendency to

      decomposition continues until the smaller either escapes to its kindred

      element or becomes one with its conqueror and this tendency in bodies to

      condense or escape is a source of motionwhere there is motion there

      must be a mover and where there is a mover there must be something to

      move these cannot exist in what is uniform and therefore motion is due

      to want of uniformity but then why when things are divided after their

      kinds do they not cease from motion the answer is that the circular

      motion of all things compresses them and as nature abhors a vacuum the

      finer and more subtle particles of the lighter elements such as fire and

      air are thrust into the interstices of the larger each of them

      penetrating according to their rarity and thus all the elements are on

      their way up and down everywhere and always into their own places hence

      there is a principle of inequality and therefore of motion in all time

    


      in the next place we may observe that there are different kinds of fire

      flame  light that burns not  the red heat of the embers of fire

      and there are varieties of air as for example the pure aether the

      opaque mist and other nameless forms water again is of two kinds

      liquid and fusile the liquid is composed of small and unequal particles

      the fusile of large and uniform particles and is more solid but

      nevertheless melts at the approach of fire and then spreads upon the

      earth when the substance cools the fire passes into the air which is

      displaced and forces together and condenses the liquid mass this process

      is called cooling and congealment of the fusile kinds the fairest and

      heaviest is gold this is hardened by filtration through rock and is of a

      bright yellow colour a shoot of gold which is darker and denser than the

      rest is called adamant another kind is called copper which is harder and

      yet lighter because the interstices are larger than in gold there is

      mingled with it a fine and small portion of earth which comes out in the

      form of rust these are a few of the conjectures which philosophy forms

      when leaving the eternal nature she turns for innocent recreation to

      consider the truths of generation

    


      water which is mingled with fire is called liquid because it rolls upon

      the earth and soft because its bases give way this becomes more equable

      when separated from fire and air and then congeals into hail or ice or

      the looser forms of hoar frost or snow there are other waters which are

      called juices and are distilled through plants of these we may mention

      first wine which warms the soul as well as the body secondly oily

      substances as for example oil or pitch thirdly honey which relaxes

      the contracted parts of the mouth and so produces sweetness fourthly

      vegetable acid which is frothy and has a burning quality and dissolves

      the flesh of the kinds of earth that which is filtered through water

      passes into stone the water is broken up by the earth and escapes in the

      form of airthis in turn presses upon the mass of earth and the

      earth compressed into an indissoluble union with the remaining water

      becomes rock rock when it is made up of equal particles is fair and

      transparent but the reverse when of unequal earth is converted into

      pottery when the watery part is suddenly drawn away or if moisture

      remains the earth when fused by fire becomes on cooling a stone of a

      black colour when the earth is finer and of a briny nature then two

      halfsolid bodies are formed by separating the watersoda and salt

      the strong compounds of earth and water are not soluble by water but only

      by fire earth itself when not consolidated is dissolved by water when

      consolidated by fire only the cohesion of water when strong is

      dissolved by fire only when weak either by air or fire the former

      entering the interstices the latter penetrating even the triangles air

      when strongly condensed is indissoluble by any power which does not reach

      the triangles and even when not strongly condensed is only resolved by

      fire compounds of earth and water are unaffected by water while the water

      occupies the interstices in them but begin to liquefy when fire enters

      into the interstices of the water they are of two kinds some of them

      like glass having more earth others like wax having more water in

      them

    


      having considered objects of sense we now pass on to sensation but we

      cannot explain sensation without explaining the nature of flesh and of the

      mortal soul and as we cannot treat of both together in order that we may

      proceed at once to the sensations we must assume the existence of body and

      soul

    


      what makes fire burn the fineness of the sides the sharpness of the

      angles the smallness of the particles the quickness of the motion

      moreover the pyramid which is the figure of fire is more cutting than

      any other the feeling of cold is produced by the larger particles of

      moisture outside the body trying to eject the smaller ones in the body

      which they compress the struggle which arises between elements thus

      unnaturally brought together causes shivering that is hard to which the

      flesh yields and soft which yields to the flesh and these two terms are

      also relative to one another the yielding matter is that which has the

      slenderest base whereas that which has a rectangular base is compact and

      repellent light and heavy are wrongly explained with reference to a lower

      and higher in place for in the universe which is a sphere there is no

      opposition of above or below and that which is to us above would be below

      to a man standing at the antipodes the greater or less difficulty in

      detaching any element from its like is the real cause of heaviness or of

      lightness if you draw the earth into the dissimilar air the particles of

      earth cling to their native element and you more easily detach a small

      portion than a large there would be the same difficulty in moving any of

      the upper elements towards the lower the smooth and the rough are

      severally produced by the union of evenness with compactness and of

      hardness with inequality

    


      pleasure and pain are the most important of the affections common to the

      whole body according to our general doctrine of sensation parts of the

      body which are easily moved readily transmit the motion to the mind but

      parts which are not easily moved have no effect upon the patient the

      bones and hair are of the latter kind sight and hearing of the former

      ordinary affections are neither pleasant nor painful the impressions of

      sight afford an example of these and are neither violent nor sudden but

      sudden replenishments of the body cause pleasure and sudden disturbances

      as for example cuttings and burnings have the opposite effect

    


      from sensations common to the whole body we proceed to those of

      particular parts the affections of the tongue appear to be caused by

      contraction and dilation but they have more of roughness or smoothness

      than is found in other affections earthy particles entering into the

      small veins of the tongue which reach to the heart when they melt into

      and dry up the little veins are astringent if they are rough or if not so

      rough they are only harsh and if excessively abstergent like potash and

      soda bitter purgatives of a weaker sort are called salt and having no

      bitterness are rather agreeable inflammatory bodies which by their

      lightness are carried up into the head cutting all that comes in their

      way are termed pungent but when these are refined by putrefaction and

      enter the narrow veins of the tongue and meet there particles of earth

      and air two kinds of globules are formedone of earthy and impure

      liquid which boils and ferments the other of pure and transparent water

      which are called bubbles of all these affections the cause is termed

      acid when on the other hand the composition of the deliquescent

      particles is congenial to the tongue and disposes the parts according to

      their nature this remedial power in them is called sweet

    


      smells are not divided into kinds all of them are transitional and arise

      out of the decomposition of one element into another for the simple air

      or water is without smell they are vapours or mists thinner than water

      and thicker than air and hence in drawing in the breath when there is an

      obstruction the air passes but there is no smell they have no names

      but are distinguished as pleasant and unpleasant and their influence

      extends over the whole region from the head to the navel

    


      hearing is the effect of a stroke which is transmitted through the ears by

      means of the air brain and blood to the soul beginning at the head and

      extending to the liver the sound which moves swiftly is acute that which

      moves slowly is grave that which is uniform is smooth and the opposite

      is harsh loudness depends on the quantity of the sound of the harmony of

      sounds i will hereafter speak

    


      colours are flames which emanate from all bodies having particles

      corresponding to the sense of sight some of the particles are less and

      some larger and some are equal to the parts of the sight the equal

      particles appear transparent the larger contract and the lesser dilate

      the sight white is produced by the dilation black by the contraction of

      the particles of sight there is also a swifter motion of another sort of

      fire which forces a way through the passages of the eyes and elicits from

      them a union of fire and water which we call tears the inner fire flashes

      forth and the outer finds a way in and is extinguished in the moisture

      and all sorts of colours are generated by the mixture this affection is

      termed by us dazzling and the object which produces it is called bright

      there is yet another sort of fire which mingles with the moisture of the

      eye without flashing and produces a colour like bloodto this we

      give the name of red a bright element mingling with red and white

      produces a colour which we call auburn the law of proportion however

      according to which compound colours are formed cannot be determined

      scientifically or even probably red when mingled with black and white

      gives a purple hue which becomes umber when the colours are burnt and

      there is a larger admixture of black flamecolour is a mixture of auburn

      and dun dun of white and black yellow of white and auburn white and

      bright meeting and falling upon a full black become dark blue dark blue

      mingling with white becomes a light blue the union of flamecolour and

      black makes leekgreen there is no difficulty in seeing how other colours

      are probably composed but he who should attempt to test the truth of this

      by experiment would forget the difference of the human and divine nature

      god only is able to compound and resolve substances such experiments are

      impossible to man

    


      these are the elements of necessity which the creator received in the

      world of generation when he made the allsufficient and perfect creature

      using the secondary causes as his ministers but himself fashioning the

      good in all things for there are two sorts of causes the one divine the

      other necessary and we should seek to discover the divine above all and

      for their sake the necessary because without them the higher cannot be

      attained by us

    


      having now before us the causes out of which the rest of our discourse is

      to be framed let us go back to the point at which we began and add a

      fair ending to our tale as i said at first all things were originally a

      chaos in which there was no order or proportion the elements of this

      chaos were arranged by the creator and out of them he made the world of

      the divine he himself was the author but he committed to his offspring

      the creation of the mortal from him they received the immortal soul but

      themselves made the body to be its vehicle and constructed within another

      soul which was mortal and subject to terrible affectionspleasure

      the inciter of evil pain which deters from good rashness and fear

      foolish counsellors anger hard to be appeased hope easily led astray

      these they mingled with irrational sense and alldaring love according to

      necessary laws and so framed man and fearing to pollute the divine

      element they gave the mortal soul a separate habitation in the breast

      parted off from the head by a narrow isthmus and as in a house the

      womens apartments are divided from the mens the cavity of the thorax

      was divided into two parts a higher and a lower the higher of the two

      which is the seat of courage and anger lies nearer to the head between

      the midriff and the neck and assists reason in restraining the desires

      the heart is the house of guard in which all the veins meet and through

      them reason sends her commands to the extremity of her kingdom when the

      passions are in revolt or danger approaches from without then the heart

      beats and swells and the creating powers knowing this implanted in the

      body the soft and bloodless substance of the lung having a porous and

      springy nature like a sponge and being kept cool by drink and air which

      enters through the trachea

    


      the part of the soul which desires meat and drink was placed between the

      midriff and navel where they made a sort of manger and here they bound

      it down like a wild animal away from the councilchamber and leaving

      the better principle undisturbed to advise quietly for the good of the

      whole for the creator knew that the belly would not listen to reason and

      was under the power of idols and fancies wherefore he framed the liver to

      connect with the lower nature contriving that it should be compact and

      bright and sweet and also bitter and smooth in order that the power of

      thought which originates in the mind might there be reflected terrifying

      the belly with the elements of bitterness and gall and a suffusion of

      bilious colours when the liver is contracted and causing pain and misery

      by twisting out of its place the lobe and closing up the vessels and

      gates and the converse happens when some gentle inspiration coming from

      intelligence mirrors the opposite fancies giving rest and sweetness and

      freedom and at night moderation and peace accompanied with prophetic

      insight when reason and sense are asleep for the authors of our being

      in obedience to their fathers will and in order to make men as good as

      they could gave to the liver the power of divination which is never

      active when men are awake or in health but when they are under the

      influence of some disorder or enthusiasm then they receive intimations

      which have to be interpreted by others who are called prophets but should

      rather be called interpreters of prophecy after death these intimations

      become unintelligible the spleen which is situated in the neighbourhood

      on the left side keeps the liver bright and clean as a napkin does a

      mirror and the evacuations of the liver are received into it and being a

      hollow tissue it is for a time swollen with these impurities but when the

      body is purged it returns to its natural size

    


      the truth concerning the soul can only be established by the word of god

      still we may venture to assert what is probable both concerning soul and

      body

    


      the creative powers were aware of our tendency to excess and so when they

      made the belly to be a receptacle for food in order that men might not

      perish by insatiable gluttony they formed the convolutions of the

      intestines in this way retarding the passage of food through the body

      lest mankind should be absorbed in eating and drinking and the whole race

      become impervious to divine philosophy

    


      the creation of bones and flesh was on this wise the foundation of these

      is the marrow which binds together body and soul and the marrow is made

      out of such of the primary triangles as are adapted by their perfection to

      produce all the four elements these god took and mingled them in due

      proportion making as many kinds of marrow as there were hereafter to be

      kinds of souls the receptacle of the divine soul he made round and

      called that portion of the marrow brain intending that the vessel

      containing this substance should be the head the remaining part he

      divided into long and round figures and to these as to anchors fastening

      the mortal soul he proceeded to make the rest of the body first forming

      for both parts a covering of bone the bone was formed by sifting pure

      smooth earth and wetting it with marrow it was then thrust alternately

      into fire and water and thus rendered insoluble by either of bone he

      made a globe which he placed around the brain leaving a narrow opening

      and around the marrow of the neck and spine he formed the vertebrae like

      hinges which extended from the head through the whole of the trunk and

      as the bone was brittle and liable to mortify and destroy the marrow by

      too great rigidity and susceptibility to heat and cold he contrived

      sinews and fleshthe first to give flexibility the second to guard

      against heat and cold and to be a protection against falls containing a

      warm moisture which in summer exudes and cools the body and in winter is

      a defence against cold having this in view the creator mingled earth

      with fire and water and mixed with them a ferment of acid and salt so as

      to form pulpy flesh but the sinews he made of a mixture of bone and

      unfermented flesh giving them a mean nature between the two and a yellow

      colour hence they were more glutinous than flesh but softer than bone

      the bones which have most of the living soul within them he covered with

      the thinnest film of flesh those which have least of it he lodged

      deeper at the joints he diminished the flesh in order not to impede the

      flexure of the limbs and also to avoid clogging the perceptions of the

      mind about the thighs and arms which have no sense because there is

      little soul in the marrow and about the inner bones he laid the flesh

      thicker for where the flesh is thicker there is less feeling except in

      certain parts which the creator has made solely of flesh as for example

      the tongue had the combination of solid bone and thick flesh been

      consistent with acute perceptions the creator would have given man a

      sinewy and fleshy head and then he would have lived twice as long but

      our creators were of opinion that a shorter life which was better was

      preferable to a longer which was worse and therefore they covered the

      head with thin bone and placed the sinews at the extremity of the head

      round the neck and fastened the jawbones to them below the face and they

      framed the mouth having teeth and tongue and lips with a view to the

      necessary and the good for food is a necessity and the river of speech

      is the best of rivers still the head could not be left a bare globe of

      bone on account of the extremes of heat and cold nor be allowed to become

      dull and senseless by an overgrowth of flesh wherefore it was covered by

      a peel or skin which met and grew by the help of the cerebral humour the

      diversity of the sutures was caused by the struggle of the food against

      the courses of the soul the skin of the head was pierced by fire and out

      of the punctures came forth a moisture part liquid and part of a skinny

      nature which was hardened by the pressure of the external cold and became

      hair and god gave hair to the head of man to be a light covering so that

      it might not interfere with his perceptions nails were formed by

      combining sinew skin and bone and were made by the creators with a view

      to the future when as they knew women and other animals who would

      require them would be framed out of man

    


      the gods also mingled natures akin to that of man with other forms and

      perceptions thus trees and plants were created which were originally

      wild and have been adapted by cultivation to our use they partake of that

      third kind of life which is seated between the midriff and the navel and

      is altogether passive and incapable of reflection

    


      when the creators had furnished all these natures for our sustenance they

      cut channels through our bodies as in a garden watering them with a

      perennial stream two were cut down the back along the back bone where

      the skin and flesh meet one on the right and the other on the left

      having the marrow of generation between them in the next place they

      divided the veins about the head and interlaced them with each other in

      order that they might form an additional link between the head and the

      body and that the sensations from both sides might be diffused throughout

      the body in the third place they contrived the passage of liquids which

      may be explained in this wayfiner bodies retain coarser but not

      the coarser the finer and the belly is capable of retaining food but not

      fire and air god therefore formed a network of fire and air to irrigate

      the veins having within it two lesser nets and stretched cords reaching

      from both the lesser nets to the extremity of the outer net the inner

      parts of the net were made by him of fire the lesser nets and their

      cavities of air the two latter he made to pass into the mouth the one

      ascending by the airpipes from the lungs the other by the side of the

      airpipes from the belly the entrance to the first he divided into two

      parts both of which he made to meet at the channels of the nose that

      when the mouth was closed the passage connected with it might still be fed

      with air the cavity of the network he spread around the hollows of the

      body making the entire receptacle to flow into and out of the lesser nets

      and the lesser nets into and out of it while the outer net found a way

      into and out of the pores of the body and the internal heat followed the

      air to and fro these as we affirm are the phenomena of respiration and

      all this process takes place in order that the body may be watered and

      cooled and nourished and the meat and drink digested and liquefied and

      carried into the veins

    


      the causes of respiration have now to be considered the exhalation of the

      breath through the mouth and nostrils displaces the external air and at

      the same time leaves a vacuum into which through the pores the air which

      is displaced enters also the vacuum which is made when the air is exhaled

      through the pores is filled up by the inhalation of breath through the

      mouth and nostrils the explanation of this double phenomenon is as

      followselements move towards their natural places now as every

      animal has within him a fountain of fire the air which is inhaled through

      the mouth and nostrils on coming into contact with this is heated and

      when heated in accordance with the law of attraction it escapes by the

      way it entered toward the place of fire on leaving the body it is cooled

      and drives round the air which it displaces through the pores into the

      empty lungs this again is in turn heated by the internal fire and

      escapes as it entered through the pores

    


      the phenomena of medical cuppingglasses of swallowing and of the

      hurling of bodies are to be explained on a similar principle as also

      sounds which are sometimes discordant on account of the inequality of

      them and again harmonious by reason of equality the slower sounds

      reaching the swifter when they begin to pause by degrees assimilate with

      them whence arises a pleasure which even the unwise feel and which to

      the wise becomes a higher sense of delight being an imitation of divine

      harmony in mortal motions streams flow lightnings play amber and the

      magnet attract not by reason of attraction but because nature abhors a

      vacuum and because things when compounded or dissolved move different

      ways each to its own place

    


      i will now return to the phenomena of respiration the fire entering the

      belly minces the food and as it escapes fills the veins by drawing

      after it the divided portions and thus the streams of nutriment are

      diffused through the body the fruits or herbs which are our daily

      sustenance take all sorts of colours when intermixed but the colour of

      red or fire predominates and hence the liquid which we call blood is red

      being the nurturing principle of the body whence all parts are watered

      and empty places filled

    


      the process of repletion and depletion is produced by the attraction of

      like to like after the manner of the universal motion the external

      elements by their attraction are always diminishing the substance of the

      body the particles of blood too formed out of the newly digested food

      are attracted towards kindred elements within the body and so fill up the

      void when more is taken away than flows in then we decay and when less

      we grow and increase

    


      the young of every animal has the triangles new and closely locked

      together and yet the entire frame is soft and delicate being newly made

      of marrow and nurtured on milk these triangles are sharper than those

      which enter the body from without in the shape of food and therefore they

      cut them up but as life advances the triangles wear out and are no

      longer able to assimilate food and at length when the bonds which unite

      the triangles of the marrow become undone they in turn unloose the bonds

      of the soul and if the release be according to nature she then flies

      away with joy for the death which is natural is pleasant but that which

      is caused by violence is painful

    


      every one may understand the origin of diseases they may be occasioned by

      the disarrangement or disproportion of the elements out of which the body

      is framed this is the origin of many of them but the worst of all owe

      their severity to the following causes there is a natural order in the

      human frame according to which the flesh and sinews are made of blood the

      sinews out of the fibres and the flesh out of the congealed substance

      which is formed by separation from the fibres the glutinous matter which

      comes away from the sinews and the flesh not only binds the flesh to the

      bones but nourishes the bones and waters the marrow when these processes

      take place in regular order the body is in health

    


      but when the flesh wastes and returns into the veins there is discoloured

      blood as well as air in the veins having acid and salt qualities from

      which is generated every sort of phlegm and bile all things go the wrong

      way and cease to give nourishment to the body no longer preserving their

      natural courses but at war with themselves and destructive to the

      constitution of the body the oldest part of the flesh which is hard to

      decompose blackens from long burning and from being corroded grows

      bitter and as the bitter element refines away becomes acid when tinged

      with blood the bitter substance has a red colour and this when mixed with

      black takes the hue of grass or again the bitter substance has an auburn

      colour when new flesh is decomposed by the internal flame to all which

      phenomena some physician or philosopher who was able to see the one in

      many has given the name of bile the various kinds of bile have names

      answering to their colours lymph or serum is of two kinds first the

      whey of blood which is gentle secondly the secretion of dark and bitter

      bile which when mingled under the influence of heat with salt is

      malignant and is called acid phlegm there is also white phlegm formed by

      the decomposition of young and tender flesh and covered with little

      bubbles separately invisible but becoming visible when collected the

      water of tears and perspiration and similar substances is also the watery

      part of fresh phlegm all these humours become sources of disease when the

      blood is replenished in irregular ways and not by food or drink the

      danger however is not so great when the foundation remains for then

      there is a possibility of recovery but when the substance which unites

      the flesh and bones is diseased and is no longer renewed from the muscles

      and sinews and instead of being oily and smooth and glutinous becomes

      rough and salt and dry then the fleshy parts fall away and leave the

      sinews bare and full of brine and the flesh gets back again into the

      circulation of the blood and makes the previously mentioned disorders

      still greater there are other and worse diseases which are prior to

      these as when the bone through the density of the flesh does not receive

      sufficient air and becomes stagnant and gangrened and crumbling away

      passes into the food and the food into the flesh and the flesh returns

      again into the blood worst of all and most fatal is the disease of the

      marrow by which the whole course of the body is reversed there is a

      third class of diseases which are produced some by wind and some by

      phlegm and some by bile when the lung which is the steward of the air

      is obstructed by rheums and in one part no air and in another too much

      enters in then the parts which are unrefreshed by air corrode and other

      parts are distorted by the excess of air and in this manner painful

      diseases are produced the most painful are caused by wind generated

      within the body which gets about the great sinews of the shouldersthese

      are termed tetanus the cure of them is difficult and in most cases they

      are relieved only by fever white phlegm which is dangerous if kept in

      by reason of the air bubbles is not equally dangerous if able to escape

      through the pores although it variegates the body generating diverse

      kinds of leprosies if when mingled with black bile it disturbs the

      courses of the head in sleep there is not so much danger but if it

      assails those who are awake then the attack is far more dangerous and is

      called epilepsy or the sacred disease acid and salt phlegm is the source

      of catarrh

    


      inflammations originate in bile which is sometimes relieved by boils and

      swellings but when detained and above all when mingled with pure blood

      generates many inflammatory disorders disturbing the position of the

      fibres which are scattered about in the blood in order to maintain the

      balance of rare and dense which is necessary to its regular circulation

      if the bile which is only stale blood or liquefied flesh comes in

      little by little it is congealed by the fibres and produces internal cold

      and shuddering but when it enters with more of a flood it overcomes the

      fibres by its heat and reaches the spinal marrow and burning up the

      cables of the soul sets her free from the body when on the other hand the

      body though wasted still holds out then the bile is expelled like an

      exile from a factious state causing associating diarrhoeas and

      dysenteries and similar disorders the body which is diseased from the

      effects of fire is in a continual fever when air is the agent the fever

      is quotidian when water the fever intermits a day when earth which is

      the most sluggish element the fever intermits three days and is with

      difficulty shaken off

    


      of mental disorders there are two sorts one madness the other ignorance

      and they may be justly attributed to disease excessive pleasures or pains

      are among the greatest diseases and deprive men of their senses when the

      seed about the spinal marrow is too abundant the body has too great

      pleasures and pains and during a great part of his life he who is the

      subject of them is more or less mad he is often thought bad but this is

      a mistake for the truth is that the intemperance of lust is due to the

      fluidity of the marrow produced by the loose consistency of the bones and

      this is true of vice in general which is commonly regarded as

      disgraceful whereas it is really involuntary and arises from a bad habit

      of the body and evil education in like manner the soul is often made

      vicious by the influence of bodily pain the briny phlegm and other bitter

      and bilious humours wander over the body and find no exit but are

      compressed within and mingle their own vapours with the motions of the

      soul and are carried to the three places of the soul creating infinite

      varieties of trouble and melancholy of rashness and cowardice of

      forgetfulness and stupidity when men are in this evil plight of body and

      evil forms of government and evil discourses are superadded and there is

      no education to save them they are corrupted through two causes but of

      neither of them are they really the authors for the planters are to blame

      rather than the plants the educators and not the educated still we

      should endeavour to attain virtue and avoid vice but this is part of

      another subject

    


      enough of diseasei have now to speak of the means by which the mind

      and body are to be preserved a higher theme than the other the good is

      the beautiful and the beautiful is the symmetrical and there is no

      greater or fairer symmetry than that of body and soul as the contrary is

      the greatest of deformities a leg or an arm too long or too short is at

      once ugly and unserviceable and the same is true if body and soul are

      disproportionate for a strong and impassioned soul may fret the pigmy

      body to decay and so produce convulsions and other evils the violence

      of controversy or the earnestness of enquiry will often generate

      inflammations and rheums which are not understood or assigned to their

      true cause by the professors of medicine and in like manner the body may

      be too much for the soul darkening the reason and quickening the animal

      desires the only security is to preserve the balance of the two and to

      this end the mathematician or philosopher must practise gymnastics and

      the gymnast must cultivate music the parts of the body too must be

      treated in the same waythey should receive their appropriate

      exercise for the body is set in motion when it is heated and cooled by

      the elements which enter in or is dried up and moistened by external

      things and if given up to these processes when at rest it is liable to

      destruction but the natural motion as in the world so also in the human

      frame produces harmony and divides hostile powers the best exercise is

      the spontaneous motion of the body as in gymnastics because most akin to

      the motion of mind not so good is the motion of which the source is in

      another as in sailing or riding least good when the body is at rest and

      the motion is in parts only which is a species of motion imparted by

      physic this should only be resorted to by men of sense in extreme cases

      lesser diseases are not to be irritated by medicine for every disease is

      akin to the living being and has an appointed term just as life has

      which depends on the form of the triangles and cannot be protracted when

      they are worn out and he who instead of accepting his destiny

      endeavours to prolong his life by medicine is likely to multiply and

      magnify his diseases regimen and not medicine is the true cure when a

      man has time at his disposal

    


      enough of the nature of man and of the body and of training and

      education the subject is a great one and cannot be adequately treated as

      an appendage to another to sum up all in a word there are three kinds of

      soul located within us and any one of them if remaining inactive

      becomes very weak if exercised very strong wherefore we should duly

      train and exercise all three kinds

    


      the divine soul god lodged in the head to raise us like plants which are

      not of earthly origin to our kindred for the head is nearest to heaven

      he who is intent upon the gratification of his desires and cherishes the

      mortal soul has all his ideas mortal and is himself mortal in the truest

      sense but he who seeks after knowledge and exercises the divine part of

      himself in godly and immortal thoughts attains to truth and immortality

      as far as is possible to man and also to happiness while he is training

      up within him the divine principle and indwelling power of order there is

      only one way in which one person can benefit another and that is by

      assigning to him his proper nurture and motion to the motions of the soul

      answer the motions of the universe and by the study of these the

      individual is restored to his original nature

    


      thus we have finished the discussion of the universe which according to

      our original intention has now been brought down to the creation of man

      completeness seems to require that something should be briefly said about

      other animals first of women who are probably degenerate and cowardly

      men and when they degenerated the gods implanted in men the desire of

      union with them creating in man one animate substance and in woman

      another in the following mannerthe outlet for liquids they

      connected with the living principle of the spinal marrow which the man

      has the desire to emit into the fruitful womb of the woman this is like a

      fertile field in which the seed is quickened and matured and at last

      brought to light when this desire is unsatisfied the man is overmastered

      by the power of the generative organs and the woman is subjected to

      disorders from the obstruction of the passages of the breath until the

      two meet and pluck the fruit of the tree

    


      the race of birds was created out of innocent lightminded men who

      thought to pursue the study of the heavens by sight these were

      transformed into birds and grew feathers instead of hair the race of

      wild animals were men who had no philosophy and never looked up to heaven

      or used the courses of the head but followed only the influences of

      passion naturally they turned to their kindred earth and put their

      forelegs to the ground and their heads were crushed into strange oblong

      forms some of them have four feet and some of them more than fourthe

      latter who are the more senseless drawing closer to their native

      element the most senseless of all have no limbs and trail their whole

      body on the ground the fourth kind are the inhabitants of the waters

      these are made out of the most senseless and ignorant and impure of men

      whom god placed in the uttermost parts of the world in return for their

      utter ignorance and caused them to respire water instead of the pure

      element of air such are the laws by which animals pass into one another

    


      and so the world received animals mortal and immortal and was fulfilled

      with them and became a visible god comprehending the visible made in

      the image of the intellectual being the one perfect onlybegotten heaven

      nature in the aspect which she presented to a greek philosopher of the

      fourth century before christ is not easily reproduced to modern eyes the

      associations of mythology and poetry have to be added and the unconscious

      influence of science has to be subtracted before we can behold the

      heavens or the earth as they appeared to the greek the philosopher

      himself was a child and also a mana child in the range of his

      attainments but also a great intelligence having an insight into nature

      and often anticipations of the truth he was full of original thoughts

      and yet liable to be imposed upon by the most obvious fallacies he

      occasionally confused numbers with ideas and atoms with numbers his a

      priori notions were out of all proportion to his experience he was ready

      to explain the phenomena of the heavens by the most trivial analogies of

      earth the experiments which nature worked for him he sometimes accepted

      but he never tried experiments for himself which would either prove or

      disprove his theories his knowledge was unequal while in some branches

      such as medicine and astronomy he had made considerable proficiency

      there were others such as chemistry electricity mechanics of which the

      very names were unknown to him he was the natural enemy of mythology and

      yet mythological ideas still retained their hold over him he was

      endeavouring to form a conception of principles but these principles or

      ideas were regarded by him as real powers or entities to which the world

      had been subjected he was always tending to argue from what was near to

      what was remote from what was known to what was unknown from man to the

      universe and back again from the universe to man while he was arranging

      the world he was arranging the forms of thought in his own mind and the

      light from within and the light from without often crossed and helped to

      confuse one another he might be compared to a builder engaged in some

      great design who could only dig with his hands because he was unprovided

      with common tools or to some poet or musician like tynnichus ion

      obliged to accommodate his lyric raptures to the limits of the tetrachord

      or of the flute

    


      the hesiodic and orphic cosmogonies were a phase of thought intermediate

      between mythology and philosophy and had a great influence on the

      beginnings of knowledge there was nothing behind them they were to

      physical science what the poems of homer were to early greek history they

      made men think of the world as a whole they carried the mind back into

      the infinity of past time they suggested the first observation of the

      effects of fire and water on the earths surface to the ancient physics

      they stood much in the same relation which geology does to modern science

      but the greek was not like the enquirer of the last generation confined

      to a period of six thousand years he was able to speculate freely on the

      effects of infinite ages in the production of physical phenomena he could

      imagine cities which had existed time out of mind states laws laws or

      forms of art and music which had lasted not in word only but in very

      truth for ten thousand years laws he was aware that natural phenomena

      like the delta of the nile might have slowly accumulated in long periods

      of time hdt but he seems to have supposed that the course of events

      was recurring rather than progressive to this he was probably led by the

      fixedness of egyptian customs and the general observation that there were

      other civilisations in the world more ancient than that of hellas

    


      the ancient philosophers found in mythology many ideas which if not

      originally derived from nature were easily transferred to hersuch

      for example as love or hate corresponding to attraction or repulsion or

      the conception of necessity allied both to the regularity and irregularity

      of nature or of chance the nameless or unknown cause or of justice

      symbolizing the law of compensation are of the fates and furies

      typifying the fixed order or the extraordinary convulsions of nature

      their own interpretations of homer and the poets were supposed by them to

      be the original meaning musing in themselves on the phenomena of nature

      they were relieved at being able to utter the thoughts of their hearts in

      figures of speech which to them were not figures and were already

      consecrated by tradition hesiod and the orphic poets moved in a region of

      halfpersonification in which the meaning or principle appeared through

      the person in their vaster conceptions of chaos erebus aether night

      and the like the first rude attempts at generalization are dimly seen

      the gods themselves especially the greater gods such as zeus poseidon

      apollo athene are universals as well as individuals they were gradually

      becoming lost in a common conception of mind or god they continued to

      exist for the purposes of ritual or of art but from the sixth century

      onwards or even earlier there arose and gained strength in the minds of

      men the notion of one god greatest among gods and men who was all

      sight all hearing all knowing xenophanes

    


      under the influence of such ideas perhaps also deriving from the

      traditions of their own or of other nations scraps of medicine and

      astronomy men came to the observation of nature the greek philosopher

      looked at the blue circle of the heavens and it flashed upon him that all

      things were one the tumult of sense abated and the mind found repose in

      the thought which former generations had been striving to realize the

      first expression of this was some element rarefied by degrees into a pure

      abstraction and purged from any tincture of sense soon an inner world of

      ideas began to be unfolded more absorbing more overpowering more

      abiding than the brightest of visible objects which to the eye of the

      philosopher looking inward seemed to pale before them retaining only a

      faint and precarious existence at the same time the minds of men parted

      into the two great divisions of those who saw only a principle of motion

      and of those who saw only a principle of rest in nature and in

      themselves there were born heracliteans or eleatics as there have been

      in later ages born aristotelians or platonists like some philosophers in

      modern times who are accused of making a theory first and finding their

      facts afterwards the advocates of either opinion never thought of

      applying either to themselves or to their adversaries the criterion of

      fact they were mastered by their ideas and not masters of them like the

      heraclitean fanatics whom plato has ridiculed in the theaetetus they were

      incapable of giving a reason of the faith that was in them and had all

      the animosities of a religious sect yet doubtless there was some first

      impression derived from external nature which as in mythology so also

      in philosophy worked upon the minds of the first thinkers though

      incapable of induction or generalization in the modern sense they caught

      an inspiration from the external world the most general facts or

      appearances of nature the circle of the universe the nutritive power of

      water the air which is the breath of life the destructive force of fire

      the seeming regularity of the greater part of nature and the irregularity

      of a remnant the recurrence of day and night and of the seasons the

      solid earth and the impalpable aether were always present to them

    


      the great source of error and also the beginning of truth to them was

      reasoning from analogy they could see resemblances but not differences

      and they were incapable of distinguishing illustration from argument

      analogy in modern times only points the way and is immediately verified

      by experiment the dreams and visions which pass through the

      philosophers mind of resemblances between different classes of

      substances or between the animal and vegetable world are put into the

      refiners fire and the dross and other elements which adhere to them are

      purged away but the contemporary of plato and socrates was incapable of

      resisting the power of any analogy which occurred to him and was drawn

      into any consequences which seemed to follow he had no methods of

      difference or of concomitant variations by the use of which he could

      distinguish the accidental from the essential he could not isolate

      phenomena and he was helpless against the influence of any word which had

      an equivocal or double sense

    


      yet without this crude use of analogy the ancient physical philosopher

      would have stood still he could not have made even one guess among many

      without comparison the course of natural phenomena would have passed

      unheeded before his eyes like fair sights or musical sounds before the

      eyes and ears of an animal even the fetichism of the savage is the

      beginning of reasoning the assumption of the most fanciful of causes

      indicates a higher mental state than the absence of all enquiry about

      them the tendency to argue from the higher to the lower from man to the

      world has led to many errors but has also had an elevating influence on

      philosophy the conception of the world as a whole a person an animal

      has been the source of hasty generalizations yet this general grasp of

      nature led also to a spirit of comprehensiveness in early philosophy

      which has not increased but rather diminished as the fields of knowledge

      have become more divided the modern physicist confines himself to one or

      perhaps two branches of science but he comparatively seldom rises above

      his own department and often falls under the narrowing influence which

      any single branch when pursued to the exclusion of every other has over

      the mind language two exercised a spell over the beginnings of physical

      philosophy leading to error and sometimes to truth for many thoughts

      were suggested by the double meanings of words greek and the accidental

      distinctions of words sometimes led the ancient philosopher to make

      corresponding differences in things greek if they are the same why

      have they different names or if they are different why have they the

      same nameis an argument not easily answered in the infancy of

      knowledge the modern philosopher has always been taught the lesson which

      he still imperfectly learns that he must disengage himself from the

      influence of words nor are there wanting in plato who was himself too

      often the victim of them impressive admonitions that we should regard not

      words but things states but upon the whole the ancients though not

      entirely dominated by them were much more subject to the influence of

      words than the moderns they had no clear divisions of colours or

      substances even the four elements were undefined the fields of knowledge

      were not parted off they were bringing order out of disorder having a

      small grain of experience mingled in a confused heap of a priori notions

      and yet probably their first impressions the illusions and mirages of

      their fancy created a greater intellectual activity and made a nearer

      approach to the truth than any patient investigation of isolated facts

      for which the time had not yet come could have accomplished

    


      there was one more illusion to which the ancient philosophers were

      subject and against which plato in his later dialogues seems to be

      strugglingthe tendency to mere abstractions not perceiving that

      pure abstraction is only negation they thought that the greater the

      abstraction the greater the truth behind any pair of ideas a new idea

      which comprehended themthe greek as it was technically termedbegan

      at once to appear two are truer than three one than two the words

      being or unity or essence or good became sacred to them they

      did not see that they had a word only and in one sense the most unmeaning

      of words they did not understand that the content of notions is in

      inverse proportion to their universalitythe element which is the

      most widely diffused is also the thinnest or in the language of the

      common logic the greater the extension the less the comprehension but

      this vacant idea of a whole without parts of a subject without

      predicates a rest without motion has been also the most fruitful of all

      ideas it is the beginning of a priori thought and indeed of thinking at

      all men were led to conceive it not by a love of hasty generalization

      but by a divine instinct a dialectical enthusiasm in which the human

      faculties seemed to yearn for enlargement we know that being is only

      the verb of existence the copula the most general symbol of relation

      the first and most meagre of abstractions but to some of the ancient

      philosophers this little word appeared to attain divine proportions and

      to comprehend all truth being or essence and similar words represented

      to them a supreme or divine being in which they thought that they found

      the containing and continuing principle of the universe in a few years

      the human mind was peopled with abstractions a new world was called into

      existence to give law and order to the old but between them there was

      still a gulf and no one could pass from the one to the other

    


      number and figure were the greatest instruments of thought which were

      possessed by the greek philosopher having the same power over the mind

      which was exerted by abstract ideas they were also capable of practical

      application many curious and to the early thinker mysterious properties

      of them came to light when they were compared with one another they

      admitted of infinite multiplication and construction in pythagorean

      triangles or in proportions of  and  or compounds of them

      the laws of the world seemed to be more than half revealed they were also

      capable of infinite subdivisiona wonder and also a puzzle to the

      ancient thinker rep they were not like being or essence mere vacant

      abstractions but admitted of progress and growth while at the same time

      they confirmed a higher sentiment of the mind that there was order in the

      universe and so there began to be a real sympathy between the world

      within and the world without the numbers and figures which were present

      to the minds eye became visible to the eye of sense the truth of nature

      was mathematics the other properties of objects seemed to reappear only

      in the light of number law and morality also found a natural expression

      in number and figure instruments of such power and elasticity could not

      fail to be a most gracious assistance to the first efforts of human

      intelligence

    


      there was another reason why numbers had so great an influence over the

      minds of early thinkersthey were verified by experience every use

      of them even the most trivial assured men of their truth they were

      everywhere to be found in the least things and the greatest alike one

      two three counted on the fingers was a trivial matter rep a little

      instrument out of which to create a world but from these and by the help

      of these all our knowledge of nature has been developed they were the

      measure of all things and seemed to give law to all things nature was

      rescued from chaos and confusion by their power the notes of music the

      motions of the stars the forms of atoms the evolution and recurrence of

      days months years the military divisions of an army the civil

      divisions of a state seemed to afford a present witness of themwhat

      would have become of man or of the world if deprived of number rep the

      mystery of number and the mystery of music were akin there was a music of

      rhythm and of harmonious motion everywhere and to the real connexion

      which existed between music and number a fanciful or imaginary relation

      was superadded there was a music of the spheres as well as of the notes

      of the lyre if in all things seen there was number and figure why should

      they not also pervade the unseen world with which by their wonderful and

      unchangeable nature they seemed to hold communion

    


      two other points strike us in the use which the ancient philosophers made

      of numbers first they applied to external nature the relations of them

      which they found in their own minds and where nature seemed to be at

      variance with number as for example in the case of fractions they

      protested against her rep arist metaph having long meditated on the

      properties of  or  or of    they discovered in them

      many curious correspondences and were disposed to find in them the secret

      of the universe secondly they applied number and figure equally to those

      parts of physics such as astronomy or mechanics in which the modern

      philosopher expects to find them and to those in which he would never

      think of looking for them such as physiology and psychology for the

      sciences were not yet divided and there was nothing really irrational in

      arguing that the same laws which regulated the heavenly bodies were

      partially applied to the erring limbs or brain of man astrology was the

      form which the lively fancy of ancient thinkers almost necessarily gave to

      astronomy the observation that the lower principle eg mechanics is

      always seen in the higher eg in the phenomena of life further tended

      to perplex them platos doctrine of the same and the other ruling the

      courses of the heavens and of the human body is not a mere vagary but is

      a natural result of the state of knowledge and thought at which he had

      arrived

    


      when in modern times we contemplate the heavens a certain amount of

      scientific truth imperceptibly blends even with the cursory glance of an

      unscientific person he knows that the earth is revolving round the sun

      and not the sun around the earth he does not imagine the earth to be the

      centre of the universe and he has some conception of chemistry and the

      cognate sciences a very different aspect of nature would have been

      present to the mind of the early greek philosopher he would have beheld

      the earth a surface only not mirrored however faintly in the glass of

      science but indissolubly connected with some theory of one two or more

      elements he would have seen the world pervaded by number and figure

      animated by a principle of motion immanent in a principle of rest he

      would have tried to construct the universe on a quantitative principle

      seeming to find in endless combinations of geometrical figures or in the

      infinite variety of their sizes a sufficient account of the multiplicity

      of phenomena to these a priori speculations he would add a rude

      conception of matter and his own immediate experience of health and

      disease his cosmos would necessarily be imperfect and unequal being the

      first attempt to impress form and order on the primaeval chaos of human

      knowledge he would see all things as in a dream

    


      the ancient physical philosophers have been charged by dr whewell and

      others with wasting their fine intelligences in wrong methods of enquiry

      and their progress in moral and political philosophy has been sometimes

      contrasted with their supposed failure in physical investigations they

      had plenty of ideas says dr whewell and plenty of facts but their

      ideas did not accurately represent the facts with which they were

      acquainted this is a very crude and misleading way of describing ancient

      science it is the mistake of an uneducated personuneducated that

      is in the higher sense of the wordwho imagines every one else to

      be like himself and explains every other age by his own no doubt the

      ancients often fell into strange and fanciful errors the time had not yet

      arrived for the slower and surer path of the modern inductive philosophy

      but it remains to be shown that they could have done more in their age and

      country or that the contributions which they made to the sciences with

      which they were acquainted are not as great upon the whole as those made

      by their successors there is no single step in astronomy as great as that

      of the nameless pythagorean who first conceived the world to be a body

      moving round the sun in space there is no truer or more comprehensive

      principle than the application of mathematics alike to the heavenly

      bodies and to the particles of matter the ancients had not the

      instruments which would have enabled them to correct or verify their

      anticipations and their opportunities of observation were limited plato

      probably did more for physical science by asserting the supremacy of

      mathematics than aristotle or his disciples by their collections of facts

      when the thinkers of modern times following bacon undervalue or

      disparage the speculations of ancient philosophers they seem wholly to

      forget the conditions of the world and of the human mind under which they

      carried on their investigations when we accuse them of being under the

      influence of words do we suppose that we are altogether free from this

      illusion when we remark that greek physics soon became stationary or

      extinct may we not observe also that there have been and may be again

      periods in the history of modern philosophy which have been barren and

      unproductive we might as well maintain that greek art was not real or

      great because it had nihil simile aut secundum as say that greek physics

      were a failure because they admire no subsequent progress

    


      the charge of premature generalization which is often urged against

      ancient philosophers is really an anachronism for they can hardly be said

      to have generalized at all they may be said more truly to have cleared up

      and defined by the help of experience ideas which they already possessed

      the beginnings of thought about nature must always have this character a

      true method is the result of many ages of experiment and observation and

      is ever going on and enlarging with the progress of science and knowledge

      at first men personify nature then they form impressions of nature at

      last they conceive measure or laws of nature they pass out of mythology

      into philosophy early science is not a process of discovery in the modern

      sense but rather a process of correcting by observation and to a certain

      extent only the first impressions of nature which mankind when they

      began to think had received from poetry or language or unintelligent

      sense of all scientific truths the greatest and simplest is the

      uniformity of nature this was expressed by the ancients in many ways as

      fate or necessity or measure or limit unexpected events of which the

      cause was unknown to them they attributed to chance thucyd but their

      conception of nature was never that of law interrupted by exceptionsa

      somewhat unfortunate metaphysical invention of modern times which is at

      variance with facts and has failed to satisfy the requirements of thought

    


 






      section 

    


      platos account of the soul is partly mythical or figurative and partly

      literal not that either he or we can draw a line between them or say

      this is poetry this is philosophy for the transition from the one to

      the other is imperceptible neither must we expect to find in him absolute

      consistency he is apt to pass from one level or stage of thought to

      another without always making it apparent that he is changing his ground

      in such passages we have to interpret his meaning by the general spirit of

      his writings to reconcile his inconsistencies would be contrary to the

      first principles of criticism and fatal to any true understanding of him

    


      there is a further difficulty in explaining this part of the timaeusthe

      natural order of thought is inverted we begin with the most abstract and

      proceed from the abstract to the concrete we are searching into things

      which are upon the utmost limit of human intelligence and then of a

      sudden we fall rather heavily to the earth there are no intermediate

      steps which lead from one to the other but the abstract is a vacant form

      to us until brought into relation with man and nature god and the world

      are mere names like the being of the eleatics unless some human

      qualities are added on to them yet the negation has a kind of unknown

      meaning to us the priority of god and of the world which he is imagined

      to have created to all other existences gives a solemn awe to them and

      as in other systems of theology and philosophy that of which we know

      least has the greatest interest to us

    


      there is no use in attempting to define or explain the first god in the

      platonic system who has sometimes been thought to answer to god the

      father or the world in whom the fathers of the church seemed to

      recognize the firstborn of every creature nor need we discuss at length

      how far plato agrees in the later jewish idea of creation according to

      which god made the world out of nothing for his original conception of

      matter as something which has no qualities is really a negation moreover

      in the hebrew scriptures the creation of the world is described even more

      explicitly than in the timaeus not as a single act but as a work or

      process which occupied six days there is a chaos in both and it would be

      untrue to say that the greek any more than the hebrew had any definite

      belief in the eternal existence of matter the beginning of things

      vanished into the distance the real creation began not with matter but

      with ideas according to plato in the timaeus god took of the same and

      the other of the divided and undivided of the finite and infinite and

      made essence and out of the three combined created the soul of the world

      to the soul he added a body formed out of the four elements the general

      meaning of these words is that god imparted determinations of thought or

      as we might say gave law and variety to the material universe the

      elements are moving in a disorderly manner before the work of creation

      begins and there is an eternal pattern of the world which like the

      idea of good is not the creator himself but not separable from him

      the pattern too though eternal is a creation a world of thought prior

      to the world of sense which may be compared to the wisdom of god in the

      book of ecclesiasticus or to the god in the form of a globe of the old

      eleatic philosophers the visible which already exists is fashioned in

      the likeness of this eternal pattern on the other hand there is no truth

      of which plato is more firmly convinced than of the priority of the soul

      to the body both in the universe and in man so inconsistent are the

      forms in which he describes the works which no tongue can utterhis

      language as he himself says partaking of his own uncertainty about the

      things of which he is speaking

    


      we may remark in passing that the platonic compared with the jewish

      description of the process of creation has less of freedom or spontaneity

      the creator in plato is still subject to a remnant of necessity which he

      cannot wholly overcome when his work is accomplished he remains in his

      own nature plato is more sensible than the hebrew prophet of the

      existence of evil which he seeks to put as far as possible out of the way

      of god and he can only suppose this to be accomplished by god retiring

      into himself and committing the lesser works of creation to inferior

      powers compare however laws for another solution of the difficulty

    


      nor can we attach any intelligible meaning to his words when he speaks of

      the visible being in the image of the invisible for how can that which is

      divided be like that which is undivided or that which is changing be the

      copy of that which is unchanging all the old difficulties about the ideas

      come back upon us in an altered form we can imagine two worlds one of

      which is the mere double of the other or one of which is an imperfect

      copy of the other or one of which is the vanishing ideal of the other

      but we cannot imagine an intellectual world which has no qualitiesa

      thing in itselfa point which has no parts or magnitude which is

      nowhere and nothing this cannot be the archetype according to which god

      made the world and is in reality whether in plato or in kant a mere

      negative residuum of human thought

    


      there is another aspect of the same difficulty which appears to have no

      satisfactory solution in what relation does the archetype stand to the

      creator himself for the idea or pattern of the world is not the thought

      of god but a separate selfexistent nature of which creation is the

      copy we can only reply  that to the mind of plato subject and object

      were not yet distinguished  that he supposes the process of creation

      to take place in accordance with his own theory of ideas and as we cannot

      give a consistent account of the one neither can we of the other he

      means  to say that the creation of the world is not a material process

      of working with legs and arms but ideal and intellectual according to

      his own fine expression the thought of god made the god that was to be

      he means  to draw an absolute distinction between the invisible or

      unchangeable which is or is the place of mind or being and the world of

      sense or becoming which is visible and changing he means  that the

      idea of the world is prior to the world just as the other ideas are prior

      to sensible objects and like them may be regarded as eternal and

      selfexistent and also like the idea of good may be viewed apart from

      the divine mind

    


      there are several other questions which we might ask and which can receive

      no answer or at least only an answer of the same kind as the preceding

      how can matter be conceived to exist without form or how can the

      essences or forms of things be distinguished from the eternal ideas or

      essence itself from the soul or how could there have been motion in the

      chaos when as yet time was not or how did chaos come into existence if

      not by the will of the creator or how could there have been a time when

      the world was not if time was not or how could the creator have taken

      portions of an indivisible same or how could space or anything else have

      been eternal when time is only created or how could the surfaces of

      geometrical figures have formed solids we must reply again that we cannot

      follow plato in all his inconsistencies but that the gaps of thought are

      probably more apparent to us than to him he would perhaps have said

      that the first things are known only to god and to him of men whom god

      loves how often have the gaps in theology been concealed from the eye of

      faith and we may say that only by an effort of metaphysical imagination

      can we hope to understand plato from his own point of view we must not

      ask for consistency everywhere we find traces of the platonic theory of

      knowledge expressed in an objective form which by us has to be translated

      into the subjective before we can attach any meaning to it and this

      theory is exhibited in so many different points of view that we cannot

      with any certainty interpret one dialogue by another eg the timaeus by

      the parmenides or phaedrus or philebus

    


      the soul of the world may also be conceived as the personification of the

      numbers and figures in which the heavenly bodies move imagine these as in

      a pythagorean dream stripped of qualitative difference and reduced to

      mathematical abstractions they too conform to the principle of the same

      and may be compared with the modern conception of laws of nature they are

      in space but not in time and they are the makers of time they are

      represented as constantly thinking of the same for thought in the view of

      plato is equivalent to truth or law and need not imply a human

      consciousness a conception which is familiar enough to us but has no

      place hardly even a name in ancient greek philosophy to this principle

      of the same is opposed the principle of the otherthe principle of

      irregularity and disorder of necessity and chance which is only

      partially impressed by mathematical laws and figures we may observe by

      the way that the principle of the other which is the principle of

      plurality and variation in the timaeus has nothing in common with the

      other of the sophist which is the principle of determination the

      element of the same dominates to a certain extent over the otherthe

      fixed stars keep the wanderers of the inner circle in their courses and

      a similar principle of fixedness or order appears to regulate the bodily

      constitution of man but there still remains a rebellious seed of evil

      derived from the original chaos which is the source of disorder in the

      world and of vice and disease in man

    


      but what did plato mean by essence greek which is the intermediate

      nature compounded of the same and the other and out of which together

      with these two the soul of the world is created it is difficult to

      explain a process of thought so strange and unaccustomed to us in which

      modern distinctions run into one another and are lost sight of first let

      us consider once more the meaning of the same and the other the same is

      the unchanging and indivisible the heaven of the fixed stars partaking

      of the divine nature which having law in itself gives law to all

      besides and is the element of order and permanence in man and on the

      earth it is the rational principle mind regarded as a work as creationnot

      as the creator the old tradition of parmenides and of the eleatic being

      the foundation of so much in the philosophy of greece and of the world

      was lingering in platos mind the other is the variable or changing

      element the residuum of disorder or chaos which cannot be reduced to

      order nor altogether banished the source of evil seen in the errors of

      man and also in the wanderings of the planets a necessity which protrudes

      through nature of this too there was a shadow in the eleatic philosophy

      in the realm of opinion which like a mist seemed to darken the purity

      of truth in itselfso far the words of plato may perhaps find an

      intelligible meaning but when he goes on to speak of the essence which is

      compounded out of both the track becomes fainter and we can only follow

      him with hesitating steps but still we find a trace reappearing of the

      teaching of anaxagoras all was confusion and then mind came and

      arranged things we have already remarked that plato was not acquainted

      with the modern distinction of subject and object and therefore he

      sometimes confuses mind and the things of mindgreek and greek

      by greek he clearly means some conception of the intelligible and the

      intelligent it belongs to the class of greek matter being the same

      the eternalfor any of these terms being almost vacant of meaning

      is equally suitable to express indefinite existenceare compared or

      united with the other or diverse and out of the union or comparison is

      elicited the idea of intelligence the one in many brighter than any

      promethean fire phil which coexisting with them and so forming a new

      existence is or becomes the intelligible worldso we may perhaps

      venture to paraphrase or interpret or put into other words the parable in

      which plato has wrapped up his conception of the creation of the world

      the explanation may help to fill up with figures of speech the void of

      knowledge

    


      the entire compound was divided by the creator in certain proportions and

      reunited it was then cut into two strips which were bent into an inner

      circle and an outer both moving with an uniform motion around a centre

      the outer circle containing the fixed the inner the wandering stars the

      soul of the world was diffused everywhere from the centre to the

      circumference to this god gave a body consisting at first of fire and

      earth and afterwards receiving an addition of air and water because

      solid bodies like the world are always connected by two middle terms and

      not by one the world was made in the form of a globe and all the

      material elements were exhausted in the work of creation

    


      the proportions in which the soul of the world as well as the human soul

      is divided answer to a series of numbers        composed of

      the two pythagorean progressions     and     of which the

      number  represents a point  and  lines  and   and  the squares

      and cubes respectively of  and  this series of which the intervals are

      afterwards filled up probably represents  the diatonic scale according

      to the pythagoreans and plato  the order and distances of the heavenly

      bodies and  may possibly contain an allusion to the music of the

      spheres which is referred to in the myth at the end of the republic the

      meaning of the words that solid bodies are always connected by two middle

      terms or mean proportionals has been much disputed the most received

      explanation is that of martin who supposes that plato is only speaking of

      surfaces and solids compounded of prime numbers ie of numbers not made

      up of two factors or in other words only measurable by unity the

      square of any such number represents a surface the cube a solid the

      squares of any two such numbers eg  squared  squared    have

      always a single mean proportional eg  and  have the single mean 

      whereas the cubes of primes eg  cubed and  cubed have always two

      mean proportionals eg  but to this explanation of

      martins it may be objected  that plato nowhere says that his

      proportion is to be limited to prime numbers  that the limitation of

      surfaces to squares is also not to be found in his words nor  is there

      any evidence to show that the distinction of prime from other numbers was

      known to him what plato chiefly intends to express is that a solid

      requires a stronger bond than a surface and that the double bond which is

      given by two means is stronger than the single bond given by one having

      reflected on the singular numerical phenomena of the existence of one mean

      proportional between two square numbers are rather perhaps only between

      the two lowest squares and of two mean proportionals between two cubes

      perhaps again confining his attention to the two lowest cubes he finds in

      the latter symbol an expression of the relation of the elements as in the

      former an image of the combination of two surfaces between fire and

      earth the two extremes he remarks that there are introduced not one

      but two elements air and water which are compared to the two mean

      proportionals between two cube numbers the vagueness of his language does

      not allow us to determine whether anything more than this was intended by

      him

    


      leaving the further explanation of details which the reader will find

      discussed at length in boeckh and martin we may now return to the main

      argument why did god make the world like man he must have a purpose

      and his purpose is the diffusion of that goodness or good which he himself

      is the term goodness is not to be understood in this passage as meaning

      benevolence or love in the christian sense of the term but rather law

      order harmony like the idea of good in the republic the ancient

      mythologers and even the hebrew prophets had spoken of the jealousy of

      god and the greek had imagined that there was a nemesis always attending

      the prosperity of mortals but plato delights to think of god as the

      author of order in his works who like a father lives over again in his

      children and can never have too much of good or friendship among his

      creatures only as there is a certain remnant of evil inherent in matter

      which he cannot get rid of he detaches himself from them and leaves them

      to themselves that he may be guiltless of their faults and sufferings

    


      between the ideal and the sensible plato interposes the two natures of

      time and space time is conceived by him to be only the shadow or image of

      eternity which ever is and never has been or will be but is described in

      a figure only as past or future this is one of the great thoughts of

      early philosophy which are still as difficult to our minds as they were

      to the early thinkers or perhaps more difficult because we more

      distinctly see the consequences which are involved in such an hypothesis

      all the objections which may be urged against kants doctrine of the

      ideality of space and time at once press upon us if time is unreal then

      all which is contained in time is unrealthe succession of human

      thoughts as well as the flux of sensations there is no connecting link

      between greek and greek yet on the other hand we are conscious that

      knowledge is independent of time that truth is not a thing of yesterday

      or tomorrow but an eternal now to the spectator of all time and all

      existence the universe remains at rest the truths of geometry and

      arithmetic in all their combinations are always the same the generations

      of men like the leaves of the forest come and go but the mathematical

      laws by which the world is governed remain and seem as if they could

      never change the everpresent image of space is transferred to timesuccession

      is conceived as extension we remark that plato does away with the above

      and below in space as he has done away with the absolute existence of

      past and future the course of time unless regularly marked by divisions

      of number partakes of the indefiniteness of the heraclitean flux by such

      reflections we may conceive the greek to have attained the metaphysical

      conception of eternity which to the hebrew was gained by meditation on

      the divine being no one saw that this objective was really a subjective

      and involved the subjectivity of all knowledge non in tempore sed cum

      tempore finxit deus mundum says st augustine repeating a thought

      derived from the timaeus but apparently unconscious of the results to

      which his doctrine would have led

    


      the contradictions involved in the conception of time or motion like the

      infinitesimal in space were a source of perplexity to the mind of the

      greek who was driven to find a point of view above or beyond them they

      had sprung up in the decline of the eleatic philosophy and were very

      familiar to plato as we gather from the parmenides the consciousness of

      them had led the great eleatic philosopher to describe the nature of god

      or being under negatives he sings of being unbegotten and imperishable

      unmoved and neverending which never was nor will be but always is one

      and continuous which cannot spring from any other for it cannot be said

      or imagined not to be the idea of eternity was for a great part a

      negation there are regions of speculation in which the negative is hardly

      separable from the positive and even seems to pass into it not only

      buddhism but greek as well as christian philosophy show that it is quite

      possible that the human mind should retain an enthusiasm for mere

      negations in different ages and countries there have been forms of light

      in which nothing could be discerned and which have nevertheless exercised

      a lifegiving and illumining power for the higher intelligence of man

      seems to require not only something above sense but above knowledge

      which can only be described as mind or being or truth or god or the

      unchangeable and eternal element in the expression of which all

      predicates fail and fall short eternity or the eternal is not merely the

      unlimited in time but the truest of all being the most real of all

      realities the most certain of all knowledge which we nevertheless only

      see through a glass darkly the passionate earnestness of parmenides

      contrasts with the vacuity of the thought which he is revolving in his

      mind

    


      space is said by plato to be the containing vessel or nurse of

      generation reflecting on the simplest kinds of external objects which

      to the ancients were the four elements he was led to a more general

      notion of a substance more or less like themselves out of which they

      were fashioned he would not have them too precisely distinguished thus

      seems to have arisen the first dim perception of greek or matter which

      has played so great a part in the metaphysical philosophy of aristotle and

      his followers but besides the material out of which the elements are

      made there is also a space in which they are contained there arises thus

      a second nature which the senses are incapable of discerning and which can

      hardly be referred to the intelligible class for it is and it is not it

      is nowhere when filled it is nothing when empty hence it is said to be

      discerned by a kind of spurious or analogous reason partaking so feebly

      of existence as to be hardly perceivable yet always reappearing as the

      containing mother or nurse of all things it had not that sort of

      consistency to plato which has been given to it in modern times by

      geometry and metaphysics neither of the greek words by which it is

      described are so purely abstract as the english word space or the latin

      spatium neither plato nor any other greek would have spoken of greek

      or greek in the same manner as we speak of time and space

    


      yet space is also of a very permanent or even eternal nature and plato

      seems more willing to admit of the unreality of time than of the unreality

      of space because as he says all things must necessarily exist in space

      we on the other hand are disposed to fancy that even if space were

      annihilated time might still survive he admits indeed that our knowledge

      of space is of a dreamy kind and is given by a spurious reason without

      the help of sense compare the hypotheses and images of rep it is true

      that it does not attain to the clearness of ideas but like them it seems

      to remain even if all the objects contained in it are supposed to have

      vanished away hence it was natural for plato to conceive of it as

      eternal we must remember further that in his attempt to realize either

      space or matter the two abstract ideas of weight and extension which are

      familiar to us had never passed before his mind

    


      thus far god working according to an eternal pattern out of his goodness

      has created the same the other and the essence compare the three

      principles of the philebusthe finite the infinite and the union

      of the two and out of them has formed the outer circle of the fixed

      stars and the inner circle of the planets divided according to certain

      musical intervals he has also created time the moving image of eternity

      and space existing by a sort of necessity and hardly distinguishable from

      matter the matter out of which the world is formed is not absolutely

      void but retains in the chaos certain germs or traces of the elements

      these plato like empedocles supposed to be four in numberfire

      air earth and water they were at first mixed together but already in

      the chaos before god fashioned them by form and number the greater

      masses of the elements had an appointed place into the confusion greek

      which preceded plato does not attempt further to penetrate they are

      called elements but they are so far from being elements greek or

      letters in the higher sense that they are not even syllables or first

      compounds the real elements are two triangles the rectangular isosceles

      which has but one form and the most beautiful of the many forms of

      scalene which is half of an equilateral triangle by the combination of

      these triangles which exist in an infinite variety of sizes the surfaces

      of the four elements are constructed

    


      that there were only five regular solids was already known to the

      ancients and out of the surfaces which he has formed plato proceeds to

      generate the four first of the five he perhaps forgets that he is only

      putting together surfaces and has not provided for their transformation

      into solids the first solid is a regular pyramid of which the base and

      sides are formed by four equilateral or twentyfour scalene triangles

      each of the four solid angles in this figure is a little larger than the

      largest of obtuse angles the second solid is composed of the same

      triangles which unite as eight equilateral triangles and make one solid

      angle out of four plane anglessix of these angles form a regular

      octahedron the third solid is a regular icosahedron having twenty

      triangular equilateral bases and therefore  rectangular scalene

      triangles the fourth regular solid or cube is formed by the combination

      of four isosceles triangles into one square and of six squares into a

      cube the fifth regular solid or dodecahedron cannot be formed by a

      combination of either of these triangles but each of its faces may be

      regarded as composed of thirty triangles of another kind probably plato

      notices this as the only remaining regular polyhedron which from its

      approximation to a globe and possibly because as plutarch remarks it is

      composed of  x    scalene triangles platon quaest

      representing thus the signs and degrees of the zodiac as well as the

      months and days of the year god may be said to have used in the

      delineation of the universe according to plato earth was composed of

      cubes fire of regular pyramids air of regular octahedrons water of

      regular icosahedrons the stability of the last three increases with the

      number of their sides

    


      the elements are supposed to pass into one another but we must remember

      that these transformations are not the transformations of real solids but

      of imaginary geometrical figures in other words we are composing and

      decomposing the faces of substances and not the substances themselvesit

      is a house of cards which we are pulling to pieces and putting together

      again compare however laws yet perhaps plato may regard these sides or

      faces as only the forms which are impressed on preexistent matter it is

      remarkable that he should speak of each of these solids as a possible

      world in itself though upon the whole he inclines to the opinion that

      they form one world and not five to suppose that there is an infinite

      number of worlds as democritus hippolyt ref haer i had said would

      be as he satirically observes the characteristic of a very indefinite

      and ignorant mind

    


      the twenty triangular faces of an icosahedron form the faces or sides of

      two regular octahedrons and of a regular pyramid    x    and

      therefore according to plato a particle of water when decomposed is

      supposed to give two particles of air and one of fire so because an

      octahedron gives the sides of two pyramids    x  a particle of air

      is resolved into two particles of fire

    


      the transformation is effected by the superior power or number of the

      conquering elements the manner of the change is  a separation of

      portions of the elements from the masses in which they are collected 

      a resolution of them into their original triangles and  a reunion of

      them in new forms plato himself proposes the question why does motion

      continue at all when the elements are settled in their places he answers

      that although the force of attraction is continually drawing similar

      elements to the same spot still the revolution of the universe exercises

      a condensing power and thrusts them again out of their natural places

      thus want of uniformity the condition of motion is produced in all such

      disturbances of matter there is an alternative for the weaker element it

      may escape to its kindred or take the form of the strongerbecoming

      denser if it be denser or rarer if rarer this is true of fire air and

      water which being composed of similar triangles are interchangeable

      earth however which has triangles peculiar to itself is capable of

      dissolution but not of change of the interchangeable elements fire the

      rarest can only become a denser and water the densest only a rarer

      but air may become a denser or a rarer no single particle of the elements

      is visible but only the aggregates of them are seen the subordinate

      species depend not upon differences of form in the original triangles

      but upon differences of size the obvious physical phenomena from which

      plato has gathered his views of the relations of the elements seem to be

      the effect of fire upon air water and earth and the effect of water

      upon earth the particles are supposed by him to be in a perpetual process

      of circulation caused by inequality this process of circulation does not

      admit of a vacuum as he tells us in his strange account of respiration

    


      of the phenomena of light and heavy he speaks afterwards when treating of

      sensation but they may be more conveniently considered by us in this

      place they are not he says to be explained by above and below

      which in the universal globe have no existence but by the attraction of

      similars towards the great masses of similar substances fire to fire air

      to air water to water earth to earth platos doctrine of attraction

      implies not only  the attraction of similar elements to one another

      but also  of smaller bodies to larger ones had he confined himself to

      the latter he would have arrived though perhaps without any further

      result or any sense of the greatness of the discovery at the modern

      doctrine of gravitation he does not observe that water has an equal

      tendency towards both water and earth so easily did the most obvious

      facts which were inconsistent with his theories escape him

    


      the general physical doctrines of the timaeus may be summed up as follows

       plato supposes the greater masses of the elements to have been already

      settled in their places at the creation  they are four in number and

      are formed of rectangular triangles variously combined into regular solid

      figures  three of them fire air and water admit of transformation

      into one another the fourth earth cannot be similarly transformed 

      different sizes of the same triangles form the lesser species of each

      element  there is an attraction of like to likesmaller masses

      of the same kind being drawn towards greater  there is no void but

      the particles of matter are ever pushing one another round and round

      greek like the atomists plato attributes the differences between the

      elements to differences in geometrical figures but he does not explain

      the process by which surfaces become solids and he characteristically

      ridicules democritus for not seeing that the worlds are finite and not

      infinite

    


 






      section 

    


      the astronomy of plato is based on the two principles of the same and the

      other which god combined in the creation of the world the soul which is

      compounded of the same the other and the essence is diffused from the

      centre to the circumference of the heavens we speak of a soul of the

      universe but more truly regarded the universe of the timaeus is a soul

      governed by mind and holding in solution a residuum of matter or evil

      which the author of the world is unable to expel and of which plato

      cannot tell us the origin the creation in platos sense is really the

      creation of order and the first step in giving order is the division of

      the heavens into an inner and outer circle of the other and the same of

      the divisible and the indivisible answering to the two spheres of the

      planets and of the world beyond them all together moving around the

      earth which is their centre to us there is a difficulty in apprehending

      how that which is at rest can also be in motion or that which is

      indivisible exist in space but the whole description is so ideal and

      imaginative that we can hardly venture to attribute to many of platos

      words in the timaeus any more meaning than to his mythical account of the

      heavens in the republic and in the phaedrus compare his denial of the

      blasphemous opinion that there are planets or wandering stars all alike

      move in circleslaws the stars are the habitations of the souls of

      men from which they come and to which they return in attributing to the

      fixed stars only the most perfect motionthat which is on the same

      spot or circulating around the samehe might perhaps have said that

      to the spectator of all time and all existence to borrow once more his

      own grand expression or viewed in the language of spinoza sub specie

      aeternitatis they were still at rest but appeared to move in order to

      teach men the periods of time although absolutely in motion they are

      relatively at rest or we may conceive of them as resting while the space

      in which they are contained or the whole anima mundi revolves

    


      the universe revolves around a centre once in twentyfour hours but the

      orbits of the fixed stars take a different direction from those of the

      planets the outer and the inner sphere cross one another and meet again

      at a point opposite to that of their first contact the first moving in a

      circle from left to right along the side of a parallelogram which is

      supposed to be inscribed in it the second also moving in a circle along

      the diagonal of the same parallelogram from right to left or in other

      words the first describing the path of the equator the second the path

      of the ecliptic the motion of the second is controlled by the first and

      hence the oblique line in which the planets are supposed to move becomes a

      spiral the motion of the same is said to be undivided whereas the inner

      motion is split into seven unequal orbitsthe intervals between them

      being in the ratio of two and three three of eitherthe sun

      moving in the opposite direction to mercury and venus but with equal

      swiftness the remaining four moon saturn mars jupiter with unequal

      swiftness to the former three and to one another thus arises the

      following progressionmoon  sun  venus  mercury  mars 

      jupiter  saturn  this series of numbers is the compound of the two

      pythagorean ratios having the same intervals though not in the same

      order as the mixture which was originally divided in forming the soul of

      the world

    


      plato was struck by the phenomenon of mercury venus and the sun

      appearing to overtake and be overtaken by one another the true reason of

      this namely that they lie within the circle of the earths orbit was

      unknown to him and the reason which he givesthat the two former

      move in an opposite direction to the latteris far from explaining

      the appearance of them in the heavens all the planets including the sun

      are carried round in the daily motion of the circle of the fixed stars

      and they have a second or oblique motion which gives the explanation of

      the different lengths of the suns course in different parts of the earth

      the fixed stars have also two movementsa forward movement in their

      orbit which is common to the whole circle and a movement on the same spot

      around an axis which plato calls the movement of thought about the same

      in this latter respect they are more perfect than the wandering stars as

      plato himself terms them in the timaeus although in the laws he condemns

      the appellation as blasphemous

    


      the revolution of the world around earth which is accomplished in a

      single day and night is described as being the most perfect or

      intelligent yet plato also speaks of an annus magnus or cyclical year

      in which periods wonderful for their complexity are found to coincide in a

      perfect number ie a number which equals the sum of its factors as  

           this although not literally contradictory is in spirit

      irreconcilable with the perfect revolution of twentyfour hours the same

      remark may be applied to the complexity of the appearances and

      occultations of the stars which if the outer heaven is supposed to be

      moving around the centre once in twentyfour hours must be confined to

      the effects produced by the seven planets plato seems to confuse the

      actual observation of the heavens with his desire to find in them

      mathematical perfection the same spirit is carried yet further by him in

      the passage already quoted from the laws in which he affirms their

      wanderings to be an appearance only which a little knowledge of

      mathematics would enable men to correct

    


      we have now to consider the much discussed question of the rotation or

      immobility of the earth platos doctrine on this subject is contained in

      the following wordsthe earth which is our nurse compacted or

      revolving around the pole which is extended through the universe he made

      to be the guardian and artificer of night and day first and eldest of

      gods that are in the interior of heaven there is an unfortunate doubt in

      this passage  about the meaning of the word greek which is

      translated either compacted or revolving and is equally capable of

      both explanations a doubt  may also be raised as to whether the words

      artificer of day and night are consistent with the mere passive

      causation of them produced by the immobility of the earth in the midst of

      the circling universe we must admit further  that aristotle

      attributed to plato the doctrine of the rotation of the earth on its axis

      on the other hand it has been urged that if the earth goes round with the

      outer heaven and sun in twentyfour hours there is no way of accounting

      for the alternation of day and night since the equal motion of the earth

      and sun would have the effect of absolute immobility to which it may be

      replied that plato never says that the earth goes round with the outer

      heaven and sun although the whole question depends on the relation of

      earth and sun their movements are nowhere precisely described but if we

      suppose with mr grote that the diurnal rotation of the earth on its

      axis and the revolution of the sun and outer heaven precisely coincide it

      would be difficult to imagine that plato was unaware of the consequence

      for though he was ignorant of many things which are familiar to us and

      often confused in his ideas where we have become clear we have no right

      to attribute to him a childish want of reasoning about very simple facts

      or an inability to understand the necessary and obvious deductions from

      geometrical figures or movements of the causes of day and night the

      presocratic philosophers and especially the pythagoreans gave various

      accounts and therefore the question can hardly be imagined to have

      escaped him on the other hand it may be urged that the further step

      however simple and obvious is just what plato often seems to be ignorant

      of and that as there is no limit to his insight there is also no limit

      to the blindness which sometimes obscures his intelligence compare the

      construction of solids out of surfaces in his account of the creation of

      the world or the attraction of similars to similars further mr grote

      supposes not that greek means revolving or that this is the sense in

      which aristotle understood the word but that the rotation of the earth is

      necessarily implied in its adherence to the cosmical axis but a if as

      mr grote assumes plato did not see that the rotation of the earth on its

      axis and of the sun and outer heavens around the earth in equal times was

      inconsistent with the alternation of day and night neither need we

      suppose that he would have seen the immobility of the earth to be

      inconsistent with the rotation of the axis and b what proof is there

      that the axis of the world revolves at all c the comparison of the two

      passages quoted by mr grote see his pamphlet on the rotation of the

      earth from aristotle de coelo book ii greek clearly shows although

      this is a matter of minor importance that aristotle as proclus and

      simplicius supposed understood greek in the timaeus to mean

      revolving for the second passage in which motion on an axis is

      expressly mentioned refers to the first but this would be unmeaning

      unless greek in the first passage meant rotation on an axis  the

      immobility of the earth is more in accordance with platos other writings

      than the opposite hypothesis for in the phaedo the earth is described as

      the centre of the world and is not said to be in motion in the republic

      the pilgrims appear to be looking out from the earth upon the motions of

      the heavenly bodies in the phaedrus hestia who remains immovable in the

      house of zeus while the other gods go in procession is called the first

      and eldest of the gods and is probably the symbol of the earth the

      silence of plato in these and in some other passages laws in which he

      might be expected to speak of the rotation of the earth is more

      favourable to the doctrine of its immobility than to the opposite if he

      had meant to say that the earth revolves on its axis he would have said

      so in distinct words and have explained the relation of its movements to

      those of the other heavenly bodies  the meaning of the words

      artificer of day and night is literally true according to platos view

      for the alternation of day and night is not produced by the motion of the

      heavens alone or by the immobility of the earth alone but by both

      together and that which has the inherent force or energy to remain at

      rest when all other bodies are moving may be truly said to act equally

      with them  we should not lay too much stress on aristotle or the

      writer de caelo having adopted the other interpretation of the words

      although alexander of aphrodisias thinks that he could not have been

      ignorant either of the doctrine of plato or of the sense which he intended

      to give to the word greek for the citations of plato in aristotle are

      frequently misinterpreted by him and he seems hardly ever to have had in

      his mind the connection in which they occur in this instance the allusion

      is very slight and there is no reason to suppose that the diurnal

      revolution of the heavens was present to his mind hence we need not

      attribute to him the error from which we are defending plato

    


      after weighing one against the other all these complicated probabilities

      the final conclusion at which we arrive is that there is nearly as much to

      be said on the one side of the question as on the other and that we are

      not perfectly certain whether as bockh and the majority of commentators

      ancient as well as modern are inclined to believe plato thought that the

      earth was at rest in the centre of the universe or as aristotle and mr

      grote suppose that it revolved on its axis whether we assume the earth

      to be stationary in the centre of the universe or to revolve with the

      heavens no explanation is given of the variation in the length of days

      and nights at different times of the year the relations of the earth and

      heavens are so indistinct in the timaeus and so figurative in the phaedo

      phaedrus and republic that we must give up the hope of ascertaining how

      they were imagined by plato if he had any fixed or scientific conception

      of them at all

    


 






      section 

    


      the soul of the world is framed on the analogy of the soul of man and

      many traces of anthropomorphism blend with platos highest flights of

      idealism the heavenly bodies are endowed with thought the principles of

      the same and other exist in the universe as well as in the human mind the

      soul of man is made out of the remains of the elements which had been used

      in creating the soul of the world these remains however are diluted to

      the third degree by this plato expresses the measure of the difference

      between the soul human and divine the human soul like the cosmical is

      framed before the body as the mind is before the soul of eitherthis

      is the order of the divine workand the finer parts of the body

      which are more akin to the soul such as the spinal marrow are prior to

      the bones and flesh the brain the containing vessel of the divine part

      of the soul is nearly in the form of a globe which is the image of the

      gods who are the stars and of the universe

    


      there is however an inconsistency in platos manner of conceiving the

      soul of man he cannot get rid of the element of necessity which is

      allowed to enter he does not like kant attempt to vindicate for men a

      freedom out of space and time but he acknowledges him to be subject to

      the influence of external causes and leaves hardly any place for freedom

      of the will the lusts of men are caused by their bodily constitution

      though they may be increased by bad education and bad laws which implies

      that they may be decreased by good education and good laws he appears to

      have an inkling of the truth that to the higher nature of man evil is

      involuntary this is mixed up with the view which while apparently

      agreeing with it is in reality the opposite of it that vice is due to

      physical causes in the timaeus as well as in the laws he also regards

      vices and crimes as simply involuntary they are diseases analogous to the

      diseases of the body and arising out of the same causes if we draw

      together the opposite poles of platos system we find that like spinoza

      he combines idealism with fatalism

    


      the soul of man is divided by him into three parts answering roughly to

      the charioteer and steeds of the phaedrus and to the greek of the

      republic and nicomachean ethics first there is the immortal nature of

      which the brain is the seat and which is akin to the soul of the

      universe this alone thinks and knows and is the ruler of the whole

      secondly there is the higher mortal soul which though liable to

      perturbations of her own takes the side of reason against the lower

      appetites the seat of this is the heart in which courage anger and all

      the nobler affections are supposed to reside there the veins all meet it

      is their centre or house of guard whence they carry the orders of the

      thinking being to the extremities of his kingdom there is also a third or

      appetitive soul which receives the commands of the immortal part not

      immediately but mediately through the liver which reflects on its

      surface the admonitions and threats of the reason

    


      the liver is imagined by plato to be a smooth and bright substance having

      a store of sweetness and also of bitterness which reason freely uses in

      the execution of her mandates in this region as ancient superstition

      told were to be found intimations of the future but plato is careful to

      observe that although such knowledge is given to the inferior parts of

      man it requires to be interpreted by the superior reason and not

      enthusiasm is the true guide of man he is only inspired when he is

      demented by some distemper or possession the ancient saying that only a

      man in his senses can judge of his own actions is approved by modern

      philosophy too the same irony which appears in platos remark that the

      men of old time must surely have known the gods who were their ancestors

      and we should believe them as custom requires is also manifest in his

      account of divination

    


      the appetitive soul is seated in the belly and there imprisoned like a

      wild beast far away from the council chamber as plato graphically calls

      the head in order that the animal passions may not interfere with the

      deliberations of reason though the soul is said by him to be prior to the

      body yet we cannot help seeing that it is constructed on the model of the

      bodythe threefold division into the rational passionate and

      appetitive corresponding to the head heart and belly the human soul

      differs from the soul of the world in this respect that it is enveloped

      and finds its expression in matter whereas the soul of the world is not

      only enveloped or diffused in matter but is the element in which matter

      moves the breath of man is within him but the air or aether of heaven is

      the element which surrounds him and all things

    


      pleasure and pain are attributed in the timaeus to the suddenness of our

      sensationsthe first being a sudden restoration the second a sudden

      violation of nature phileb the sensations become conscious to us when

      they are exceptional sight is not attended either by pleasure or pain

      but hunger and the appeasing of hunger are pleasant and painful because

      they are extraordinary

    


 






      section 

    


      i shall not attempt to connect the physiological speculations of plato

      either with ancient or modern medicine what light i can throw upon them

      will be derived from the comparison of them with his general system

    


      there is no principle so apparent in the physics of the timaeus or in

      ancient physics generally as that of continuity the world is conceived

      of as a whole and the elements are formed into and out of one another

      the varieties of substances and processes are hardly known or noticed and

      in a similar manner the human body is conceived of as a whole and the

      different substances of which to a superficial observer it appears to be

      composedthe blood flesh sinewslike the elements out of

      which they are formed are supposed to pass into one another in regular

      order while the infinite complexity of the human frame remains

      unobserved and diseases arise from the opposite processwhen the

      natural proportions of the four elements are disturbed and the secondary

      substances which are formed out of them namely blood flesh sinews are

      generated in an inverse order

    


      plato found heat and air within the human frame and the blood circulating

      in every part he assumes in language almost unintelligible to us that a

      network of fire and air envelopes the greater part of the body this outer

      net contains two lesser nets one corresponding to the stomach the other

      to the lungs and the entrance to the latter is forked or divided into two

      passages which lead to the nostrils and to the mouth in the process of

      respiration the external net is said to find a way in and out of the pores

      of the skin while the interior of it and the lesser nets move alternately

      into each other the whole description is figurative as plato himself

      implies when he speaks of a fountain of fire which we compare to the

      network of a creel he really means by this what we should describe as a

      state of heat or temperature in the interior of the body the fountain of

      fire or heat is also in a figure the circulation of the blood the

      passage is partly imagination partly fact

    


      he has a singular theory of respiration for which he accounts solely by

      the movement of the air in and out of the body he does not attribute any

      part of the process to the action of the body itself the air has a double

      ingress and a double exit through the mouth or nostrils and through the

      skin when exhaled through the mouth or nostrils it leaves a vacuum which

      is filled up by other air finding a way in through the pores this air

      being thrust out of its place by the exhalation from the mouth and

      nostrils there is also a corresponding process of inhalation through the

      mouth or nostrils and of exhalation through the pores the inhalation

      through the pores appears to take place nearly at the same time as the

      exhalation through the mouth and conversely the internal fire is in

      either case the propelling cause outwardsthe inhaled air when

      heated by it having a natural tendency to move out of the body to the

      place of fire while the impossibility of a vacuum is the propelling cause

      inwards

    


      thus we see that this singular theory is dependent on two principles

      largely employed by plato in explaining the operations of nature the

      impossibility of a vacuum and the attraction of like to like to these

      there has to be added a third principle which is the condition of the

      action of the other twothe interpenetration of particles in

      proportion to their density or rarity it is this which enables fire and

      air to permeate the flesh

    


      platos account of digestion and the circulation of the blood is closely

      connected with his theory of respiration digestion is supposed to be

      effected by the action of the internal fire which in the process of

      respiration moves into the stomach and minces the food as the fire

      returns to its place it takes with it the minced food or blood and in

      this way the veins are replenished plato does not enquire how the blood

      is separated from the faeces

    


      of the anatomy and functions of the body he knew very littleeg

      of the uses of the nerves in conveying motion and sensation which he

      supposed to be communicated by the bones and veins he was also ignorant

      of the distinction between veins and arteriesthe latter term he

      applies to the vessels which conduct air from the mouth to the lungshe

      supposes the lung to be hollow and bloodless the spinal marrow he

      conceives to be the seed of generation he confuses the parts of the body

      with the states of the bodythe network of fire and air is spoken of

      as a bodily organ he has absolutely no idea of the phenomena of

      respiration which he attributes to a law of equalization in nature the

      air which is breathed out displacing other air which finds a way in he is

      wholly unacquainted with the process of digestion except the general

      divisions into the spleen the liver the belly and the lungs and the

      obvious distinctions of flesh bones and the limbs of the body we find

      nothing that reminds us of anatomical facts but we find much which is

      derived from his theory of the universe and transferred to man as there

      is much also in his theory of the universe which is suggested by man the

      microcosm of the human body is the lesser image of the macrocosm the

      courses of the same and the other affect both they are made of the same

      elements and therefore in the same proportions both are intelligent

      natures endued with the power of selfmotion and the same equipoise is

      maintained in both the animal is a sort of world to the particles of

      the blood which circulate in it all the four elements entered into the

      original composition of the human frame the bone was formed out of smooth

      earth liquids of various kinds pass to and fro the network of fire and

      air irrigates the veins infancy and childhood is the chaos or first

      turbid flux of sense prior to the establishment of order the intervals of

      time which may be observed in some intermittent fevers correspond to the

      density of the elements the spinal marrow including the brain is formed

      out of the finest sorts of triangles and is the connecting link between

      body and mind health is only to be preserved by imitating the motions of

      the world in space which is the mother and nurse of generation the work

      of digestion is carried on by the superior sharpness of the triangles

      forming the substances of the human body to those which are introduced

      into it in the shape of food the freshest and acutest forms of triangles

      are those that are found in children but they become more obtuse with

      advancing years and when they finally wear out and fall to pieces old

      age and death supervene

    


      as in the republic plato is still the enemy of the purgative treatment of

      physicians which except in extreme cases no man of sense will ever

      adopt for as he adds with an insight into the truth every disease is

      akin to the nature of the living being and is only irritated by

      stimulants he is of opinion that nature should be left to herself and

      is inclined to think that physicians are in vain lawswhere he says

      that warm baths would be more beneficial to the limbs of the aged rustic

      than the prescriptions of a not overwise doctor if he seems to be

      extreme in his condemnation of medicine and to rely too much on diet and

      exercise he might appeal to nearly all the best physicians of our own age

      in support of his opinions who often speak to their patients of the

      worthlessness of drugs for we ourselves are sceptical about medicine and

      very unwilling to submit to the purgative treatment of physicians may we

      not claim for plato an anticipation of modern ideas as about some

      questions of astronomy and physics so also about medicine as in the

      charmides he tells us that the body cannot be cured without the soul so

      in the timaeus he strongly asserts the sympathy of soul and body any

      defect of either is the occasion of the greatest discord and disproportion

      in the other here too may be a presentiment that in the medicine of the

      future the interdependence of mind and body will be more fully recognized

      and that the influence of the one over the other may be exerted in a

      manner which is not now thought possible

      in platos explanation of sensation we are struck by the fact that he has

      not the same distinct conception of organs of sense which is familiar to

      ourselves the senses are not instruments but rather passages through

      which external objects strike upon the mind the eye is the aperture

      through which the stream of vision passes the ear is the aperture through

      which the vibrations of sound pass but that the complex structure of the

      eye or the ear is in any sense the cause of sight and hearing he seems

      hardly to be aware

    


      the process of sight is the most complicated rep and consists of three

      elementsthe light which is supposed to reside within the eye the

      light of the sun and the light emitted from external objects when the

      light of the eye meets the light of the sun and both together meet the

      light issuing from an external object this is the simple act of sight

      when the particles of light which proceed from the object are exactly

      equal to the particles of the visual ray which meet them from within then

      the body is transparent if they are larger and contract the visual ray a

      black colour is produced if they are smaller and dilate it a white

      other phenomena are produced by the variety and motion of light a sudden

      flash of fire at once elicits light and moisture from the eye and causes

      a bright colour a more subdued light on mingling with the moisture of

      the eye produces a red colour out of these elements all other colours

      are derived all of them are combinations of bright and red with white and

      black plato himself tells us that he does not know in what proportions

      they combine and he is of opinion that such knowledge is granted to the

      gods only to have seen the affinity of them to each other and their

      connection with light is not a bad basis for a theory of colours we must

      remember that they were not distinctly defined to his as they are to our

      eyes he saw them not as they are divided in the prism or artificially

      manufactured for the painters use but as they exist in nature blended

      and confused with one another

    


      we can hardly agree with him when he tells us that smells do not admit of

      kinds he seems to think that no definite qualities can attach to bodies

      which are in a state of transition or evaporation he also makes the

      subtle observation that smells must be denser than air though thinner

      than water because when there is an obstruction to the breathing air can

      penetrate but not smell

    


      the affections peculiar to the tongue are of various kinds and like many

      other affections are caused by contraction and dilation some of them are

      produced by rough others by abstergent others by inflammatory

      substancesthese act upon the testing instruments of the tongue

      and produce a more or less disagreeable sensation while other particles

      congenial to the tongue soften and harmonize them the instruments of

      taste reach from the tongue to the heart plato has a lively sense of the

      manner in which sensation and motion are communicated from one part of the

      body to the other though he confuses the affections with the organs

      hearing is a blow which passes through the ear and ends in the region of

      the liver being transmitted by means of the air the brain and the blood

      to the soul the swifter sound is acute the sound which moves slowly is

      grave a great body of sound is loud the opposite is low discord is

      produced by the swifter and slower motions of two sounds and is converted

      into harmony when the swifter motions begin to pause and are overtaken by

      the slower

    


      the general phenomena of sensation are partly internal but the more

      violent are caused by conflict with external objects proceeding by a

      method of superficial observation plato remarks that the more sensitive

      parts of the human frame are those which are least covered by flesh as is

      the case with the head and the elbows man if his head had been covered

      with a thicker pulp of flesh might have been a longerlived animal than

      he is but could not have had as quick perceptions on the other hand the

      tongue is one of the most sensitive of organs but then this is made not

      to be a covering to the bones which contain the marrow or source of life

      but with an express purpose and in a separate mass

    


 






      section 

    


      we have now to consider how far in any of these speculations plato

      approximated to the discoveries of modern science the modern physical

      philosopher is apt to dwell exclusively on the absurdities of ancient

      ideas about science on the haphazard fancies and a priori assumptions of

      ancient teachers on their confusion of facts and ideas on their

      inconsistency and blindness to the most obvious phenomena he measures

      them not by what preceded them but by what has followed them he does not

      consider that ancient physical philosophy was not a free enquiry but a

      growth in which the mind was passive rather than active and was

      incapable of resisting the impressions which flowed in upon it he hardly

      allows to the notions of the ancients the merit of being the

      steppingstones by which he has himself risen to a higher knowledge he

      never reflects how great a thing it was to have formed a conception

      however imperfect either of the human frame as a whole or of the world

      as a whole according to the view taken in these volumes the errors of

      ancient physicists were not separable from the intellectual conditions

      under which they lived their genius was their own and they were not the

      rash and hasty generalizers which since the days of bacon we have been

      apt to suppose them the thoughts of men widened to receive experience at

      first they seemed to know all things as in a dream after a while they

      look at them closely and hold them in their hands they begin to arrange

      them in classes and to connect causes with effects general notions are

      necessary to the apprehension of particular facts the metaphysical to the

      physical before men can observe the world they must be able to conceive

      it

    


      to do justice to the subject we should consider the physical philosophy

      of the ancients as a whole we should remember  that the nebular

      theory was the received belief of several of the early physicists 

      that the development of animals out of fishes who came to land and of man

      out of the animals was held by anaximander in the sixth century before

      christ plut symp quaest plac phil  that even by philolaus and

      the early pythagoreans the earth was held to be a body like the other

      stars revolving in space around the sun or a central fire  that the

      beginnings of chemistry are discernible in the similar particles of

      anaxagoras also they knew or thought  that there was a sex in plants

      as well as in animals  they were aware that musical notes depended on

      the relative length or tension of the strings from which they were

      emitted and were measured by ratios of number  that mathematical laws

      pervaded the world and even qualitative differences were supposed to have

      their origin in number and figure  the annihilation of matter was

      denied by several of them and the seeming disappearance of it held to be

      a transformation only for although one of these discoveries might have

      been supposed to be a happy guess taken together they seem to imply a

      great advance and almost maturity of natural knowledge

    


      we should also remember when we attribute to the ancients hasty

      generalizations and delusions of language that physical philosophy and

      metaphysical too have been guilty of similar fallacies in quite recent

      times we by no means distinguish clearly between mind and body between

      ideas and facts have not many discussions arisen about the atomic theory

      in which a point has been confused with a material atom have not the

      natures of things been explained by imaginary entities such as life or

      phlogiston which exist in the mind only has not disease been regarded

      like sin sometimes as a negative and necessary sometimes as a positive

      or malignant principle the idols of bacon are nearly as common now as

      ever they are inherent in the human mind and when they have the most

      complete dominion over us we are least able to perceive them we

      recognize them in the ancients but we fail to see them in ourselves

    


      such reflections although this is not the place in which to dwell upon

      them at length lead us to take a favourable view of the speculations of

      the timaeus we should consider not how much plato actually knew but how

      far he has contributed to the general ideas of physics or supplied the

      notions which whether true or false have stimulated the minds of later

      generations in the path of discovery some of them may seem oldfashioned

      but may nevertheless have had a great influence in promoting system and

      assisting enquiry while in others we hear the latest word of physical or

      metaphysical philosophy there is also an intermediate class in which

      plato falls short of the truths of modern science though he is not wholly

      unacquainted with them  to the first class belongs the teleological

      theory of creation whether all things in the world can be explained as

      the result of natural laws or whether we must not admit of tendencies and

      marks of design also has been a question much disputed of late years

      even if all phenomena are the result of natural forces we must admit that

      there are many things in heaven and earth which are as well expressed

      under the image of mind or design as under any other at any rate the

      language of plato has been the language of natural theology down to our

      own time nor can any description of the world wholly dispense with it

      the notion of first and second or cooperative causes which originally

      appears in the timaeus has likewise survived to our own day and has been

      a great peacemaker between theology and science plato also approaches

      very near to our doctrine of the primary and secondary qualities of

      matter  another popular notion which is found in the timaeus is the

      feebleness of the human intellectgod knows the original qualities

      of things man can only hope to attain to probability we speak in almost

      the same words of human intelligence but not in the same manner of the

      uncertainty of our knowledge of nature the reason is that the latter is

      assured to us by experiment and is not contrasted with the certainty of

      ideal or mathematical knowledge but the ancient philosopher never

      experimented in the timaeus plato seems to have thought that there would

      be impiety in making the attempt he for example who tried experiments

      in colours would forget the difference of the human and divine natures

      their indefiniteness is probably the reason why he singles them out as

      especially incapable of being tested by experiment compare the saying of

      anaxagorassext pyrrhthat since snow is made of water and

      water is black snow ought to be black

    


      the greatest divination of the ancients was the supremacy which they

      assigned to mathematics in all the realms of nature for in all of them

      there is a foundation of mechanics even physiology partakes of figure and

      number and plato is not wrong in attributing them to the human frame but

      in the omission to observe how little could be explained by them thus we

      may remark in passing that the most fanciful of ancient philosophies is

      also the most nearly verified in fact the fortunate guess that the world

      is a sum of numbers and figures has been the most fruitful of

      anticipations the diatonic scale of the pythagoreans and plato

      suggested to kepler that the secret of the distances of the planets from

      one another was to be found in mathematical proportions the doctrine that

      the heavenly bodies all move in a circle is known by us to be erroneous

      but without such an error how could the human mind have comprehended the

      heavens astronomy even in modern times has made far greater progress by

      the high a priori road than could have been attained by any other yet

      strictly speakingand the remark applies to ancient physics

      generallythis high a priori road was based upon a posteriori

      grounds for there were no facts of which the ancients were so well

      assured by experience as facts of number having observed that they held

      good in a few instances they applied them everywhere and in the

      complexity of which they were capable found the explanation of the

      equally complex phenomena of the universe they seemed to see them in the

      least things as well as in the greatest in atoms as well as in suns and

      stars in the human body as well as in external nature and now a

      favourite speculation of modern chemistry is the explanation of

      qualitative difference by quantitative which is at present verified to a

      certain extent and may hereafter be of far more universal application

      what is this but the atoms of democritus and the triangles of plato the

      ancients should not be wholly deprived of the credit of their guesses

      because they were unable to prove them may they not have had like the

      animals an instinct of something more than they knew

    


      besides general notions we seem to find in the timaeus some more precise

      approximations to the discoveries of modern physical science first the

      doctrine of equipoise plato affirms almost in so many words that nature

      abhors a vacuum whenever a particle is displaced the rest push and

      thrust one another until equality is restored we must remember that these

      ideas were not derived from any definite experiment but were the original

      reflections of man fresh from the first observation of nature the latest

      word of modern philosophy is continuity and development but to plato this

      is the beginning and foundation of science there is nothing that he is so

      strongly persuaded of as that the world is one and that all the various

      existences which are contained in it are only the transformations of the

      same soul of the world acting on the same matter he would have readily

      admitted that out of the protoplasm all things were formed by the gradual

      process of creation but he would have insisted that mind and intelligencenot

      meaning by this however a conscious mind or personwere prior to

      them and could alone have created them into the workings of this eternal

      mind or intelligence he does not enter further nor would there have been

      any use in attempting to investigate the things which no eye has seen nor

      any human language can express

    


      lastly there remain two points in which he seems to touch great

      discoveries of modern timesthe law of gravitation and the

      circulation of the blood

    


       the law of gravitation according to plato is a law not only of the

      attraction of lesser bodies to larger ones but of similar bodies to

      similar having a magnetic power as well as a principle of gravitation he

      observed that earth water and air had settled down to their places and

      he imagined fire or the exterior aether to have a place beyond air when

      air seemed to go upwards and fire to pierce through airwhen water

      and earth fell downward they were seeking their native elements he did

      not remark that his own explanation did not suit all phenomena and the

      simpler explanation which assigns to bodies degrees of heaviness and

      lightness proportioned to the mass and distance of the bodies which

      attract them never occurred to him yet the affinities of similar

      substances have some effect upon the composition of the world and of this

      plato may be thought to have had an anticipation he may be described as

      confusing the attraction of gravitation with the attraction of cohesion

      the influence of such affinities and the chemical action of one body upon

      another in long periods of time have become a recognized principle of

      geology

    


       plato is perfectly awareand he could hardly be ignorantthat

      blood is a fluid in constant motion he also knew that blood is partly a

      solid substance consisting of several elements which as he might have

      observed in the use of cuppingglasses decompose and die when no

      longer in motion but the specific discovery that the blood flows out on

      one side of the heart through the arteries and returns through the veins

      on the other which is commonly called the circulation of the blood was

      absolutely unknown to him

    


      a further study of the timaeus suggests some afterthoughts which may be

      conveniently brought together in this place the topics which i propose

      briefly to reconsider are a the relation of the timaeus to the other

      dialogues of plato and to the previous philosophy b the nature of god

      and of creation c the morality of the timaeus

    


      a the timaeus is more imaginative and less scientific than any other of

      the platonic dialogues it is conjectural astronomy conjectural natural

      philosophy conjectural medicine the writer himself is constantly

      repeating that he is speaking what is probable only the dialogue is put

      into the mouth of timaeus a pythagorean philosopher and therefore here

      as in the parmenides we are in doubt how far plato is expressing his own

      sentiments hence the connexion with the other dialogues is comparatively

      slight we may fill up the lacunae of the timaeus by the help of the

      republic or phaedrus we may identify the same and other with the greek

      of the philebus we may find in the laws or in the statesman parallels

      with the account of creation and of the first origin of man it would be

      possible to frame a scheme in which all these various elements might have

      a place but such a mode of proceeding would be unsatisfactory because we

      have no reason to suppose that plato intended his scattered thoughts to be

      collected in a system there is a common spirit in his writings and there

      are certain general principles such as the opposition of the sensible and

      intellectual and the priority of mind which run through all of them but

      he has no definite forms of words in which he consistently expresses

      himself while the determinations of human thought are in process of

      creation he is necessarily tentative and uncertain and there is least of

      definiteness whenever either in describing the beginning or the end of

      the world he has recourse to myths these are not the fixed modes in

      which spiritual truths are revealed to him but the efforts of

      imagination by which at different times and in various manners he seeks

      to embody his conceptions the clouds of mythology are still resting upon

      him and he has not yet pierced to the heaven of the fixed stars which

      is beyond them it is safer then to admit the inconsistencies of the

      timaeus or to endeavour to fill up what is wanting from our own

      imagination inspired by a study of the dialogue than to refer to other

      platonic writingsand still less should we refer to the successors

      of platofor the elucidation of it

    


      more light is thrown upon the timaeus by a comparison of the previous

      philosophies for the physical science of the ancients was traditional

      descending through many generations of ionian and pythagorean

      philosophers plato does not look out upon the heavens and describe what

      he sees in them but he builds upon the foundations of others adding

      something out of the depths of his own selfconsciousness socrates had

      already spoken of god the creator who made all things for the best while

      he ridiculed the superficial explanations of phenomena which were current

      in his age he recognised the marks both of benevolence and of design in

      the frame of man and in the world the apparatus of winds and waters is

      contemptuously rejected by him in the phaedo but he thinks that there is

      a power greater than that of any atlas in the best phaedo arist

      met plato following his master affirms this principle of the best

      but he acknowledges that the best is limited by the conditions of matter

      in the generation before socrates anaxagoras had brought together chaos

      and mind and these are connected by plato in the timaeus but in

      accordance with his own mode of thinking he has interposed between them

      the idea or pattern according to which mind worked the circular impulse

      greek of the one philosopher answers to the circular movement greek of

      the other but unlike anaxagoras plato made the sun and stars living

      beings and not masses of earth or metal the pythagoreans again had framed

      a world out of numbers which they constructed into figures plato adopted

      their speculations and improved upon them by a more exact knowledge of

      geometry the atomists too made the world if not out of geometrical

      figures at least out of different forms of atoms and these atoms

      resembled the triangles of plato in being too small to be visible but

      though the physiology of the timaeus is partly borrowed from them they

      are either ignored by plato or referred to with a secret contempt and

      dislike he looks with more favour on the pythagoreans whose intervals of

      number applied to the distances of the planets reappear in the timaeus it

      is probable that among the pythagoreans living in the fourth century bc

      there were already some who like plato made the earth their centre

      whether he obtained his circles of the same and other from any previous

      thinker is uncertain the four elements are taken from empedocles the

      interstices of the timaeus may also be compared with his greek the

      passage of one element into another is common to heracleitus and several

      of the ionian philosophers so much of a syncretist is plato though not

      after the manner of the neoplatonists for the elements which he borrows

      from others are fused and transformed by his own genius on the other hand

      we find fewer traces in plato of early ionic or eleatic speculation he

      does not imagine the world of sense to be made up of opposites or to be in

      a perpetual flux but to vary within certain limits which are controlled

      by what he calls the principle of the same unlike the eleatics who

      relegated the world to the sphere of notbeing he admits creation to have

      an existence which is real and even eternal although dependent on the

      will of the creator instead of maintaining the doctrine that the void has

      a necessary place in the existence of the world he rather affirms the

      modern thesis that nature abhors a vacuum as in the sophist he also

      denies the reality of notbeing aristot metaph but though in these

      respects he differs from them he is deeply penetrated by the spirit of

      their philosophy he differs from them with reluctance and gladly

      recognizes the generous depth of parmenides theaet

    


      there is a similarity between the timaeus and the fragments of philolaus

      which by some has been thought to be so great as to create a suspicion

      that they are derived from it philolaus is known to us from the phaedo of

      plato as a pythagorean philosopher residing at thebes in the latter half

      of the fifth century bc after the dispersion of the original

      pythagorean society he was the teacher of simmias and cebes who became

      disciples of socrates we have hardly any other information about him the

      story that plato had purchased three books of his writings from a relation

      is not worth repeating it is only a fanciful way in which an ancient

      biographer dresses up the fact that there was supposed to be a resemblance

      between the two writers similar gossiping stories are told about the

      sources of the republic and the phaedo that there really existed in

      antiquity a work passing under the name of philolaus there can be no

      doubt fragments of this work are preserved to us chiefly in stobaeus a

      few in boethius and other writers they remind us of the timaeus as well

      as of the phaedrus and philebus when the writer says stob eclog that

      all things are either finite definite or infinite indefinite or a

      union of the two and that this antithesis and synthesis pervades all art

      and nature we are reminded of the philebus when he calls the centre of

      the world greek we have a parallel to the phaedrus his distinction

      between the world of order to which the sun and moon and the stars

      belong and the world of disorder which lies in the region between the

      moon and the earth approximates to platos sphere of the same and of the

      other like plato tim he denied the above and below in space and said

      that all things were the same in relation to a centre he speaks also of

      the world as one and indestructible for neither from within nor from

      without does it admit of destruction tim he mentions ten heavenly

      bodies including the sun and moon the earth and the counterearth

      greek and in the midst of them all he places the central fire around

      which they are movingthis is hidden from the earth by the

      counterearth of neither is there any trace in plato who makes the earth

      the centre of his system philolaus magnifies the virtues of particular

      numbers especially of the number  stob eclog and descants upon odd

      and even numbers after the manner of the later pythagoreans it is worthy

      of remark that these mystical fancies are nowhere to be found in the

      writings of plato although the importance of number as a form and also an

      instrument of thought is ever present to his mind both philolaus and

      plato agree in making the world move in certain numerical ratios according

      to a musical scale though bockh is of opinion that the two scales of

      philolaus and of the timaeus do not correspondwe appear not to be

      sufficiently acquainted with the early pythagoreans to know how far the

      statements contained in these fragments corresponded with their doctrines

      and we therefore cannot pronounce either in favour of the genuineness of

      the fragments with bockh and zeller or with valentine rose and

      schaarschmidt against them but it is clear that they throw but little

      light upon the timaeus and that their resemblance to it has been

      exaggerated

    


      that there is a degree of confusion and indistinctness in platos account

      both of man and of the universe has been already acknowledged we cannot

      tell nor could plato himself have told where the figure or myth ends and

      the philosophical truth begins we cannot explain nor could plato himself

      have explained to us the relation of the ideas to appearance of which

      one is the copy of the other and yet of all things in the world they are

      the most opposed and unlike this opposition is presented to us in many

      forms as the antithesis of the one and many of the finite and infinite

      of the intelligible and sensible of the unchangeable and the changing of

      the indivisible and the divisible of the fixed stars and the planets of

      the creative mind and the primeval chaos these pairs of opposites are so

      many aspects of the great opposition between ideas and phenomenathey

      easily pass into one another and sometimes the two members of the

      relation differ in kind sometimes only in degree as in aristotles

      matter and form the connexion between them is really inseparable for if

      we attempt to separate them they become devoid of content and therefore

      indistinguishable there is no difference between the idea of which

      nothing can be predicated and the chaos or matter which has no

      perceptible qualitiesbetween being in the abstract and nothing yet

      we are frequently told that the one class of them is the reality and the

      other appearance and one is often spoken of as the double or reflection

      of the other for plato never clearly saw that both elements had an equal

      place in mind and in nature and hence especially when we argue from

      isolated passages in his writings or attempt to draw what appear to us to

      be the natural inferences from them we are full of perplexity there is a

      similar confusion about necessity and freewill and about the state of

      the soul after death also he sometimes supposes that god is immanent in

      the world sometimes that he is transcendent and having no distinction of

      objective and subjective he passes imperceptibly from one to the other

      from intelligence to soul from eternity to time these contradictions may

      be softened or concealed by a judicious use of language but they cannot

      be wholly got rid of that an age of intellectual transition must also be

      one of inconsistency that the creative is opposed to the critical or

      defining habit of mind or time has been often repeated by us but as

      plato would say there is no harm in repeating twice or thrice laws

      what is important for the understanding of a great author

    


      it has not however been observed that the confusion partly arises out

      of the elements of opposing philosophies which are preserved in him he

      holds these in solution he brings them into relation with one another

      but he does not perfectly harmonize them they are part of his own mind

      and he is incapable of placing himself outside of them and criticizing

      them they grow as he grows they are a kind of composition with which his

      own philosophy is overlaid in early life he fancies that he has mastered

      them but he is also mastered by them and in language sophist which may

      be compared with the hesitating tone of the timaeus he confesses in his

      later years that they are full of obscurity to him he attributes new

      meanings to the words of parmenides and heracleitus but at times the old

      eleatic philosophy appears to go beyond him then the world of phenomena

      disappears but the doctrine of ideas is also reduced to nothingness all

      of them are nearer to one another than they themselves supposed and

      nearer to him than he supposed all of them are antagonistic to sense and

      have an affinity to number and measure and a presentiment of ideas even

      in plato they still retain their contentious or controversial character

      which was developed by the growth of dialectic he is never able to

      reconcile the first causes of the presocratic philosophers with the final

      causes of socrates himself there is no intelligible account of the

      relation of numbers to the universal ideas or of universals to the idea

      of good he found them all three in the pythagorean philosophy and in the

      teaching of socrates and of the megarians respectively and because they

      all furnished modes of explaining and arranging phenomena he is unwilling

      to give up any of them though he is unable to unite them in a consistent

      whole

    


      lastly plato though an idealist philosopher is greek and not oriental

      in spirit and feeling he is no mystic or ascetic he is not seeking in

      vain to get rid of matter or to find absorption in the divine nature or

      in the soul of the universe and therefore we are not surprised to find

      that his philosophy in the timaeus returns at last to a worship of the

      heavens and that to him as to other greeks nature though containing a

      remnant of evil is still glorious and divine he takes away or drops the

      veil of mythology and presents her to us in what appears to him to be the

      formfairer and truer farof mathematical figures it is this

      element in the timaeus no less than its affinity to certain pythagorean

      speculations which gives it a character not wholly in accordance with the

      other dialogues of plato

    


      b the timaeus contains an assertion perhaps more distinct than is found

      in any of the other dialogues rep laws of the goodness of god he was

      good himself and he fashioned the good everywhere he was not a jealous

      god and therefore he desired that all other things should be equally

      good he is the idea of good who has now become a person and speaks and

      is spoken of as god yet his personality seems to appear only in the act

      of creation in so far as he works with his eye fixed upon an eternal

      pattern he is like the human artificer in the republic here the theory of

      platonic ideas intrudes upon us god like man is supposed to have an

      ideal of which plato is unable to tell us the origin he may be said in

      the language of modern philosophy to resolve the divine mind into subject

      and object

    


      the first work of creation is perfected the second begins under the

      direction of inferior ministers the supreme god is withdrawn from the

      world and returns to his own accustomed nature tim as in the

      statesman he retires to his place of view so early did the epicurean

      doctrine take possession of the greek mind and so natural is it to the

      heart of man when he has once passed out of the stage of mythology into

      that of rational religion for he sees the marks of design in the world

      but he no longer sees or fancies that he sees god walking in the garden or

      haunting stream or mountain he feels also that he must put god as far as

      possible out of the way of evil and therefore he banishes him from an

      evil world plato is sensible of the difficulty and he often shows that

      he is desirous of justifying the ways of god to man yet on the other

      hand in the tenth book of the laws he passes a censure on those who say

      that the gods have no care of human things

    


      the creation of the world is the impression of order on a previously

      existing chaos the formula of anaxagorasall things were in chaos

      or confusion and then mind came and disposed themis a summary of

      the first part of the timaeus it is true that of a chaos without

      differences no idea could be formed all was not mixed but one and

      therefore it was not difficult for the later platonists to draw inferences

      by which they were enabled to reconcile the narrative of the timaeus with

      the mosaic account of the creation neither when we speak of mind or

      intelligence do we seem to get much further in our conception than

      circular motion which was deemed to be the most perfect plato like

      anaxagoras while commencing his theory of the universe with ideas of mind

      and of the best is compelled in the execution of his design to condescend

      to the crudest physics

    


      c the morality of the timaeus is singular and it is difficult to adjust

      the balance between the two elements of it the difficulty which plato

      feels is that which all of us feel and which is increased in our own day

      by the progress of physical science how the responsibility of man is to

      be reconciled with his dependence on natural causes and sometimes like

      other men he is more impressed by one aspect of human life sometimes by

      the other in the republic he represents man as freely choosing his own

      lot in a state prior to birtha conception which if taken

      literally would still leave him subject to the dominion of necessity in

      his after life in the statesman he supposes the human race to be

      preserved in the world only by a divine interposition while in the

      timaeus the supreme god commissions the inferior deities to avert from him

      all but selfinflicted evilswords which imply that all the evils of

      men are really selfinflicted and here like plato the insertion of a

      note in the text of an ancient writer is a literary curiosity worthy of

      remark we may take occasion to correct an error for we too hastily said

      that plato in the timaeus regarded all vices and crimes as involuntary

      but the fact is that he is inconsistent with himself in one and the same

      passage vice is attributed to the relaxation of the bodily frame and yet

      we are exhorted to avoid it and pursue virtue it is also admitted that

      good and evil conduct are to be attributed respectively to good and evil

      laws and institutions these cannot be given by individuals to themselves

      and therefore human actions in so far as they are dependent upon them

      are regarded by plato as involuntary rather than voluntary like other

      writers on this subject he is unable to escape from some degree of

      selfcontradiction he had learned from socrates that vice is ignorance

      and suddenly the doctrine seems to him to be confirmed by observing how

      much of the good and bad in human character depends on the bodily

      constitution so in modern times the speculative doctrine of necessity has

      often been supported by physical facts

    


      the timaeus also contains an anticipation of the stoical life according to

      nature man contemplating the heavens is to regulate his erring life

      according to them he is to partake of the repose of nature and of the

      order of nature to bring the variable principle in himself into harmony

      with the principle of the same the ethics of the timaeus may be summed up

      in the single idea of law to feel habitually that he is part of the

      order of the universe is one of the highest ethical motives of which man

      is capable something like this is what plato means when he speaks of the

      soul moving about the same in unchanging thought of the same he does

      not explain how man is acted upon by the lesser influences of custom or of

      opinion or how the commands of the soul watching in the citadel are

      conveyed to the bodily organs but this perhaps to use once more

      expressions of his own is part of another subject or may be more

      suitably discussed on some other occasion

    


      there is no difficulty by the help of aristotle and later writers in

      criticizing the timaeus of plato in pointing out the inconsistencies of

      the work in dwelling on the ignorance of anatomy displayed by the author

      in showing the fancifulness or unmeaningness of some of his reasons but

      the timaeus still remains the greatest effort of the human mind to

      conceive the world as a whole which the genius of antiquity has bequeathed

      to us

    



      one more aspect of the timaeus remains to be consideredthe

      mythological or geographical is it not a wonderful thing that a few pages

      of one of platos dialogues have grown into a great legend not confined

      to greece only but spreading far and wide over the nations of europe and

      reaching even to egypt and asia like the tale of troy or the legend of

      the ten tribes ewald hist of isr which perhaps originated in a few

      verses of ii esdras it has become famous because it has coincided with a

      great historical fact like the romance of king arthur which has had so

      great a charm it has found a way over the seas from one country and

      language to another it inspired the navigators of the fifteenth and

      sixteenth centuries it foreshadowed the discovery of america it realized

      the fiction so natural to the human mind because it answered the enquiry

      about the origin of the arts that there had somewhere existed an ancient

      primitive civilization it might find a place wherever men chose to look

      for it in north south east or west in the islands of the blest

      before the entrance of the straits of gibraltar in sweden or in

      palestine it mattered little whether the description in plato agreed with

      the locality assigned to it or not it was a legend so adapted to the

      human mind that it made a habitation for itself in any country it was an

      island in the clouds which might be seen anywhere by the eye of faith it

      was a subject especially congenial to the ponderous industry of certain

      french and swedish writers who delighted in heaping up learning of all

      sorts but were incapable of using it

    


      m martin has written a valuable dissertation on the opinions entertained

      respecting the island of atlantis in ancient and modern times it is a

      curious chapter in the history of the human mind the tale of atlantis is

      the fabric of a vision but it has never ceased to interest mankind it

      was variously regarded by the ancients themselves the stronger heads

      among them like strabo and longinus were as little disposed to believe

      in the truth of it as the modern reader in gulliver or robinson crusoe on

      the other hand there is no kind or degree of absurdity or fancy in which

      the more foolish writers both of antiquity and of modern times have not

      indulged respecting it the neoplatonists loyal to their master like

      some commentators on the christian scriptures sought to give an

      allegorical meaning to what they also believed to be an historical fact

      it was as if some one in our own day were to convert the poems of homer

      into an allegory of the christian religion at the same time maintaining

      them to be an exact and veritable history in the middle ages the legend

      seems to have been halfforgotten until revived by the discovery of

      america it helped to form the utopia of sir thomas more and the new

      atlantis of bacon although probably neither of those great men were at

      all imposed upon by the fiction it was most prolific in the seventeenth

      or in the early part of the eighteenth century when the human mind

      seeking for utopias or inventing them was glad to escape out of the

      dulness of the present into the romance of the past or some ideal of the

      future the later forms of such narratives contained features taken from

      the edda as well as from the old and new testament also from the tales

      of missionaries and the experiences of travellers and of colonists

    


      the various opinions respecting the island of atlantis have no interest

      for us except in so far as they illustrate the extravagances of which men

      are capable but this is a real interest and a serious lesson if we

      remember that now as formerly the human mind is liable to be imposed upon

      by the illusions of the past which are ever assuming some new form

    


      when we have shaken off the rubbish of ages there remain one or two

      questions of which the investigation has a permanent value

    


       did plato derive the legend of atlantis from an egyptian source it may

      be replied that there is no such legend in any writer previous to plato

      neither in homer nor in pindar nor in herodotus is there any mention of

      an island of atlantis nor any reference to it in aristotle nor any

      citation of an earlier writer by a later one in which it is to be found

      nor have any traces been discovered hitherto in egyptian monuments of a

      connexion between greece and egypt older than the eighth or ninth century

      bc it is true that proclus writing in the fifth century after christ

      tells us of stones and columns in egypt on which the history of the island

      of atlantis was engraved the statement may be falsethere are

      similar tales about columns set up by the canaanites whom joshua drove

      out procop but even if true it would only show that the legend 

      years after the time of plato had been transferred to egypt and

      inscribed not like other forgeries in books but on stone probably in

      the alexandrian age when egypt had ceased to have a history and began to

      appropriate the legends of other nations many such monuments were to be

      found of events which had become famous in that or other countries the

      oldest witness to the story is said to be crantor a stoic philosopher who

      lived a generation later than plato and therefore may have borrowed it

      from him the statement is found in proclus but we require better

      assurance than proclus can give us before we accept this or any other

      statement which he makes

    


      secondly passing from the external to the internal evidence we may

      remark that the story is far more likely to have been invented by plato

      than to have been brought by solon from egypt that is another part of his

      legend which plato also seeks to impose upon us the verisimilitude which

      he has given to the tale is a further reason for suspecting it for he

      could easily invent egyptian or any other tales phaedrus are not the

      words the truth of the story is a great advantage if we read between

      the lines an indication of the fiction it is only a legend that solon

      went to egypt and if he did he could not have conversed with egyptian

      priests or have read records in their temples the truth is that the

      introduction is a mosaic work of small touches which partly by their

      minuteness and also by their seeming probability win the confidence of

      the reader who would desire better evidence than that of critias who had

      heard the narrative in youth when the memory is strongest at the age of

      ten from his grandfather critias an old man of ninety who in turn had

      heard it from solon himself is not the famous expressionyou

      hellenes are ever children and there is no knowledge among you hoary with

      age really a compliment to the athenians who are described in these

      words as ever young and is the thought expressed in them to be

      attributed to the learning of the egyptian priest and not rather to the

      genius of plato or when the egyptian sayshereafter at our leisure

      we will take up the written documents and examine in detail the exact

      truth about these thingswhat is this but a literary trick by which

      plato sets off his narrative could any war between athens and the island

      of atlantis have really coincided with the struggle between the greeks and

      persians as is sufficiently hinted though not expressly stated in the

      narrative of plato and whence came the tradition to egypt or in what

      does the story consist except in the war between the two rival powers and

      the submersion of both of them and how was the tale transferred to the

      poem of solon it is not improbable says mr grote that solon did

      leave an unfinished egyptian poem plato but are probabilities for

      which there is not a tittle of evidence and which are without any

      parallel to be deemed worthy of attention by the critic how came the

      poem of solon to disappear in antiquity or why did plato if the whole

      narrative was known to him break off almost at the beginning of it

    


      while therefore admiring the diligence and erudition of m martin we

      cannot for a moment suppose that the tale was told to solon by an egyptian

      priest nor can we believe that solon wrote a poem upon the theme which

      was thus suggested to hima poem which disappeared in antiquity or

      that the island of atlantis or the antediluvian athens ever had any

      existence except in the imagination of plato martin is of opinion that

      plato would have been terrified if he could have foreseen the endless

      fancies to which his island of atlantis has given occasion rather he

      would have been infinitely amused if he could have known that his gift of

      invention would have deceived m martin himself into the belief that the

      tradition was brought from egypt by solon and made the subject of a poem

      by him m martin may also be gently censured for citing without

      sufficient discrimination ancient authors having very different degrees of

      authority and value

    


       it is an interesting and not unimportant question which is touched upon

      by martin whether the atlantis of plato in any degree held out a guiding

      light to the early navigators he is inclined to think that there is no

      real connexion between them but surely the discovery of the new world was

      preceded by a prophetic anticipation of it which like the hope of a

      messiah was entering into the hearts of men and this hope was nursed by

      ancient tradition which had found expression from time to time in the

      celebrated lines of seneca and in many other places this tradition was

      sustained by the great authority of plato and therefore the legend of the

      island of atlantis though not closely connected with the voyages of the

      early navigators may be truly said to have contributed indirectly to the

      great discovery

    


      the timaeus of plato like the protagoras and several portions of the

      phaedrus and republic was translated by cicero into latin about a

      fourth comprehending with lacunae the first portion of the dialogue is

      preserved in several mss these generally agree and therefore may be

      supposed to be derived from a single original the version is very

      faithful and is a remarkable monument of ciceros skill in managing the

      difficult and intractable greek in his treatise de natura deorum he also

      refers to the timaeus which speaking in the person of velleius the

      epicurean he severely criticises

    


      the commentary of proclus on the timaeus is a wonderful monument of the

      silliness and prolixity of the alexandrian age it extends to about thirty

      pages of the book and is thirty times the length of the original it is

      surprising that this voluminous work should have found a translator

      thomas taylor a kindred spirit who was himself a neoplatonist after

      the fashion not of the fifth or sixteenth but of the nineteenth century

      ad the commentary is of little or no value either in a philosophical

      or philological point of view the writer is unable to explain particular

      passages in any precise manner and he is equally incapable of grasping

      the whole he does not take words in their simple meaning or sentences in

      their natural connexion he is thinking not of the context in plato but

      of the contemporary pythagorean philosophers and their wordy strife he

      finds nothing in the text which he does not bring to it he is full of

      porphyry iamblichus and plotinus of misapplied logic of misunderstood

      grammar and of the orphic theology

    


      although such a work can contribute little or nothing to the understanding

      of plato it throws an interesting light on the alexandrian times it

      realizes how a philosophy made up of words only may create a deep and

      widespread enthusiasm how the forms of logic and rhetoric may usurp the

      place of reason and truth how all philosophies grow faded and

      discoloured and are patched and made up again like wornout garments and

      retain only a secondhand existence he who would study this degeneracy of

      philosophy and of the greek mind in the original cannot do better than

      devote a few of his days and nights to the commentary of proclus on the

      timaeus

    


      a very different account must be given of the short work entitled timaeus

      locrus which is a brief but clear analysis of the timaeus of plato

      omitting the introduction or dialogue and making a few small additions it

      does not allude to the original from which it is taken it is quite free

      from mysticism and neoplatonism in length it does not exceed a fifth

      part of the timaeus it is written in the doric dialect and contains

      several words which do not occur in classical greek no other indication

      of its date except this uncertain one of language appears in it in

      several places the writer has simplified the language of plato in a few

      others he has embellished and exaggerated it he generally preserves the

      thought of the original but does not copy the words on the whole this

      little tract faithfully reflects the meaning and spirit of the timaeus

    


      from the garden of the timaeus as from the other dialogues of plato we

      may still gather a few flowers and present them at parting to the reader

      there is nothing in plato grander and simpler than the conversation

      between solon and the egyptian priest in which the youthfulness of hellas

      is contrasted with the antiquity of egypt here are to be found the famous

      words o solon solon you hellenes are ever young and there is not an

      old man among youwhich may be compared to the lively saying of

      hegel that greek history began with the youth achilles and left off with

      the youth alexander the numerous arts of verisimilitude by which plato

      insinuates into the mind of the reader the truth of his narrative have

      been already referred to here occur a sentence or two not wanting in

      platonic irony greeka word to the wise to know or tell the

      origin of the other divinities is beyond us and we must accept the

      traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the

      offspring of the godsthat is what they sayand they must

      surely have known their own ancestors how can we doubt the word of the

      children of the gods although they give no probable or certain proofs

      still as they declare that they are speaking of what took place in their

      own family we must conform to custom and believe them our creators

      well knew that women and other animals would some day be framed out of

      men and they further knew that many animals would require the use of

      nails for many purposes wherefore they fashioned in men at their first

      creation the rudiments of nails or once more let us reflect on two

      serious passages in which the order of the world is supposed to find a

      place in the human soul and to infuse harmony into it the soul when

      touching anything that has essence whether dispersed in parts or

      undivided is stirred through all her powers to declare the sameness or

      difference of that thing and some other and to what individuals are

      related and by what affected and in what way and how and when both in

      the world of generation and in the world of immutable being and when

      reason which works with equal truth whether she be in the circle of the

      diverse or of the samein voiceless silence holding her onward

      course in the sphere of the selfmovedwhen reason i say is

      hovering around the sensible world and when the circle of the diverse

      also moving truly imparts the intimations of sense to the whole soul then

      arise opinions and beliefs sure and certain but when reason is concerned

      with the rational and the circle of the same moving smoothly declares it

      then intelligence and knowledge are necessarily perfected where

      proceeding in a similar path of contemplation he supposes the inward and

      the outer world mutually to imply each other god invented and gave us

      sight to the end that we might behold the courses of intelligence in the

      heaven and apply them to the courses of our own intelligence which are

      akin to them the unperturbed to the perturbed and that we learning them

      and partaking of the natural truth of reason might imitate the absolutely

      unerring courses of god and regulate our own vagaries or let us weigh

      carefully some other profound thoughts such as the following he who

      neglects education walks lame to the end of his life and returns

      imperfect and good for nothing to the world below the father and maker

      of all this universe is past finding out and even if we found him to

      tell of him to all men would be impossible let me tell you then why the

      creator made this world of generation he was good and the good can never

      have jealousy of anything and being free from jealousy he desired that

      all things should be as like himself as they could be this is in the

      truest sense the origin of creation and of the world as we shall do well

      in believing on the testimony of wise men god desired that all things

      should be good and nothing bad so far as this was attainable this is

      the leading thought in the timaeus just as the idea of good is the

      leading thought of the republic the one expression describing the

      personal the other the impersonal good or god differing in form rather

      than in substance and both equally implying to the mind of plato a divine

      reality the slight touch perhaps ironical contained in the words as

      we shall do well in believing on the testimony of wise men is very

      characteristic of plato

    



 






      timaeus

    


      persons of the dialogue socrates critias timaeus hermocrates

    


      socrates one two three but where my dear timaeus is the fourth of

      those who were yesterday my guests and are to be my entertainers today

    


      timaeus he has been taken ill socrates for he would not willingly have

      been absent from this gathering

    


      socrates then if he is not coming you and the two others must supply

      his place

    


      timaeus certainly and we will do all that we can having been handsomely

      entertained by you yesterday those of us who remain should be only too

      glad to return your hospitality

    


      socrates do you remember what were the points of which i required you to

      speak

    


      timaeus we remember some of them and you will be here to remind us of

      anything which we have forgotten or rather if we are not troubling you

      will you briefly recapitulate the whole and then the particulars will be

      more firmly fixed in our memories

    


      socrates to be sure i will the chief theme of my yesterdays discourse

      was the statehow constituted and of what citizens composed it would

      seem likely to be most perfect

    


      timaeus yes socrates and what you said of it was very much to our mind

    


      socrates did we not begin by separating the husbandmen and the artisans

      from the class of defenders of the state

    


      timaeus yes

    


      socrates and when we had given to each one that single employment and

      particular art which was suited to his nature we spoke of those who were

      intended to be our warriors and said that they were to be guardians of

      the city against attacks from within as well as from without and to have

      no other employment they were to be merciful in judging their subjects

      of whom they were by nature friends but fierce to their enemies when

      they came across them in battle

    


      timaeus exactly

    


      socrates we said if i am not mistaken that the guardians should be

      gifted with a temperament in a high degree both passionate and

      philosophical and that then they would be as they ought to be gentle to

      their friends and fierce with their enemies

    


      timaeus certainly

    


      socrates and what did we say of their education were they not to be

      trained in gymnastic and music and all other sorts of knowledge which

      were proper for them

    


      timaeus very true

    


      socrates and being thus trained they were not to consider gold or silver

      or anything else to be their own private property they were to be like

      hired troops receiving pay for keeping guard from those who were

      protected by themthe pay was to be no more than would suffice for

      men of simple life and they were to spend in common and to live together

      in the continual practice of virtue which was to be their sole pursuit

    


      timaeus that was also said

    


      socrates neither did we forget the women of whom we declared that their

      natures should be assimilated and brought into harmony with those of the

      men and that common pursuits should be assigned to them both in time of

      war and in their ordinary life

    


      timaeus that again was as you say

    


      socrates and what about the procreation of children or rather was not

      the proposal too singular to be forgotten for all wives and children were

      to be in common to the intent that no one should ever know his own child

      but they were to imagine that they were all one family those who were

      within a suitable limit of age were to be brothers and sisters those who

      were of an elder generation parents and grandparents and those of a

      younger children and grandchildren

    


      timaeus yes and the proposal is easy to remember as you say

    


      socrates and do you also remember how with a view of securing as far as

      we could the best breed we said that the chief magistrates male and

      female should contrive secretly by the use of certain lots so to

      arrange the nuptial meeting that the bad of either sex and the good of

      either sex might pair with their like and there was to be no quarrelling

      on this account for they would imagine that the union was a mere

      accident and was to be attributed to the lot

    


      timaeus i remember

    


      socrates and you remember how we said that the children of the good

      parents were to be educated and the children of the bad secretly

      dispersed among the inferior citizens and while they were all growing up

      the rulers were to be on the lookout and to bring up from below in their

      turn those who were worthy and those among themselves who were unworthy

      were to take the places of those who came up

    


      timaeus true

    


      socrates then have i now given you all the heads of our yesterdays

      discussion or is there anything more my dear timaeus which has been

      omitted

    


      timaeus nothing socrates it was just as you have said

    


      socrates i should like before proceeding further to tell you how i feel

      about the state which we have described i might compare myself to a

      person who on beholding beautiful animals either created by the painters

      art or better still alive but at rest is seized with a desire of

      seeing them in motion or engaged in some struggle or conflict to which

      their forms appear suited this is my feeling about the state which we

      have been describing there are conflicts which all cities undergo and i

      should like to hear some one tell of our own city carrying on a struggle

      against her neighbours and how she went out to war in a becoming manner

      and when at war showed by the greatness of her actions and the magnanimity

      of her words in dealing with other cities a result worthy of her training

      and education now i critias and hermocrates am conscious that i myself

      should never be able to celebrate the city and her citizens in a befitting

      manner and i am not surprised at my own incapacity to me the wonder is

      rather that the poets present as well as past are no betternot that

      i mean to depreciate them but every one can see that they are a tribe of

      imitators and will imitate best and most easily the life in which they

      have been brought up while that which is beyond the range of a mans

      education he finds hard to carry out in action and still harder

      adequately to represent in language i am aware that the sophists have

      plenty of brave words and fair conceits but i am afraid that being only

      wanderers from one city to another and having never had habitations of

      their own they may fail in their conception of philosophers and

      statesmen and may not know what they do and say in time of war when they

      are fighting or holding parley with their enemies and thus people of your

      class are the only ones remaining who are fitted by nature and education

      to take part at once both in politics and philosophy here is timaeus of

      locris in italy a city which has admirable laws and who is himself in

      wealth and rank the equal of any of his fellowcitizens he has held the

      most important and honourable offices in his own state and as i believe

      has scaled the heights of all philosophy and here is critias whom every

      athenian knows to be no novice in the matters of which we are speaking

      and as to hermocrates i am assured by many witnesses that his genius and

      education qualify him to take part in any speculation of the kind and

      therefore yesterday when i saw that you wanted me to describe the

      formation of the state i readily assented being very well aware that

      if you only would none were better qualified to carry the discussion

      further and that when you had engaged our city in a suitable war you of

      all men living could best exhibit her playing a fitting part when i had

      completed my task i in return imposed this other task upon you you

      conferred together and agreed to entertain me today as i had entertained

      you with a feast of discourse here am i in festive array and no man can

      be more ready for the promised banquet

    


      hermocrates and we too socrates as timaeus says will not be wanting in

      enthusiasm and there is no excuse for not complying with your request as

      soon as we arrived yesterday at the guestchamber of critias with whom we

      are staying or rather on our way thither we talked the matter over and

      he told us an ancient tradition which i wish critias that you would

      repeat to socrates so that he may help us to judge whether it will

      satisfy his requirements or not

    


      critias i will if timaeus who is our other partner approves

    


      timaeus i quite approve

    


      critias then listen socrates to a tale which though strange is

      certainly true having been attested by solon who was the wisest of the

      seven sages he was a relative and a dear friend of my greatgrandfather

      dropides as he himself says in many passages of his poems and he told

      the story to critias my grandfather who remembered and repeated it to

      us there were of old he said great and marvellous actions of the

      athenian city which have passed into oblivion through lapse of time and

      the destruction of mankind and one in particular greater than all the

      rest this we will now rehearse it will be a fitting monument of our

      gratitude to you and a hymn of praise true and worthy of the goddess on

      this her day of festival

    


      socrates very good and what is this ancient famous action of the

      athenians which critias declared on the authority of solon to be not a

      mere legend but an actual fact

    


      critias i will tell an oldworld story which i heard from an aged man

      for critias at the time of telling it was as he said nearly ninety

      years of age and i was about ten now the day was that day of the

      apaturia which is called the registration of youth at which according to

      custom our parents gave prizes for recitations and the poems of several

      poets were recited by us boys and many of us sang the poems of solon

      which at that time had not gone out of fashion one of our tribe either

      because he thought so or to please critias said that in his judgment

      solon was not only the wisest of men but also the noblest of poets the

      old man as i very well remember brightened up at hearing this and said

      smiling yes amynander if solon had only like other poets made poetry

      the business of his life and had completed the tale which he brought with

      him from egypt and had not been compelled by reason of the factions and

      troubles which he found stirring in his own country when he came home to

      attend to other matters in my opinion he would have been as famous as

      homer or hesiod or any poet

    


      and what was the tale about critias said amynander

    


      about the greatest action which the athenians ever did and which ought to

      have been the most famous but through the lapse of time and the

      destruction of the actors it has not come down to us

    


      tell us said the other the whole story and how and from whom solon

      heard this veritable tradition

    


      he repliedin the egyptian delta at the head of which the river

      nile divides there is a certain district which is called the district of

      sais and the great city of the district is also called sais and is the

      city from which king amasis came the citizens have a deity for their

      foundress she is called in the egyptian tongue neith and is asserted by

      them to be the same whom the hellenes call athene they are great lovers

      of the athenians and say that they are in some way related to them to

      this city came solon and was received there with great honour he asked

      the priests who were most skilful in such matters about antiquity and

      made the discovery that neither he nor any other hellene knew anything

      worth mentioning about the times of old on one occasion wishing to draw

      them on to speak of antiquity he began to tell about the most ancient

      things in our part of the worldabout phoroneus who is called the

      first man and about niobe and after the deluge of the survival of

      deucalion and pyrrha and he traced the genealogy of their descendants

      and reckoning up the dates tried to compute how many years ago the events

      of which he was speaking happened thereupon one of the priests who was

      of a very great age said o solon solon you hellenes are never anything

      but children and there is not an old man among you solon in return asked

      him what he meant i mean to say he replied that in mind you are all

      young there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition

      nor any science which is hoary with age and i will tell you why there

      have been and will be again many destructions of mankind arising out of

      many causes the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire

      and water and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes there is a

      story which even you have preserved that once upon a time paethon the

      son of helios having yoked the steeds in his fathers chariot because he

      was not able to drive them in the path of his father burnt up all that

      was upon the earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt now this

      has the form of a myth but really signifies a declination of the bodies

      moving in the heavens around the earth and a great conflagration of

      things upon the earth which recurs after long intervals at such times

      those who live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more

      liable to destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the seashore

      and from this calamity the nile who is our neverfailing saviour

      delivers and preserves us when on the other hand the gods purge the

      earth with a deluge of water the survivors in your country are herdsmen

      and shepherds who dwell on the mountains but those who like you live in

      cities are carried by the rivers into the sea whereas in this land

      neither then nor at any other time does the water come down from above on

      the fields having always a tendency to come up from below for which

      reason the traditions preserved here are the most ancient the fact is

      that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer sun does not

      prevent mankind exist sometimes in greater sometimes in lesser numbers

      and whatever happened either in your country or in ours or in any other

      region of which we are informedif there were any actions noble or

      great or in any other way remarkable they have all been written down by

      us of old and are preserved in our temples whereas just when you and

      other nations are beginning to be provided with letters and the other

      requisites of civilized life after the usual interval the stream from

      heaven like a pestilence comes pouring down and leaves only those of

      you who are destitute of letters and education and so you have to begin

      all over again like children and know nothing of what happened in ancient

      times either among us or among yourselves as for those genealogies of

      yours which you just now recounted to us solon they are no better than

      the tales of children in the first place you remember a single deluge

      only but there were many previous ones in the next place you do not

      know that there formerly dwelt in your land the fairest and noblest race

      of men which ever lived and that you and your whole city are descended

      from a small seed or remnant of them which survived and this was unknown

      to you because for many generations the survivors of that destruction

      died leaving no written word for there was a time solon before the

      great deluge of all when the city which now is athens was first in war

      and in every way the best governed of all cities is said to have

      performed the noblest deeds and to have had the fairest constitution of

      any of which tradition tells under the face of heaven solon marvelled at

      his words and earnestly requested the priests to inform him exactly and

      in order about these former citizens you are welcome to hear about them

      solon said the priest both for your own sake and for that of your city

      and above all for the sake of the goddess who is the common patron and

      parent and educator of both our cities she founded your city a thousand

      years before ours observe that plato gives the same date  years ago

      for the foundation of athens and for the repulse of the invasion from

      atlantis crit receiving from the earth and hephaestus the seed of

      your race and afterwards she founded ours of which the constitution is

      recorded in our sacred registers to be  years old as touching your

      citizens of  years ago i will briefly inform you of their laws and of

      their most famous action the exact particulars of the whole we will

      hereafter go through at our leisure in the sacred registers themselves if

      you compare these very laws with ours you will find that many of ours are

      the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time in the first

      place there is the caste of priests which is separated from all the

      others next there are the artificers who ply their several crafts by

      themselves and do not intermix and also there is the class of shepherds

      and of hunters as well as that of husbandmen and you will observe too

      that the warriors in egypt are distinct from all the other classes and

      are commanded by the law to devote themselves solely to military pursuits

      moreover the weapons which they carry are shields and spears a style of

      equipment which the goddess taught of asiatics first to us as in your

      part of the world first to you then as to wisdom do you observe how our

      law from the very first made a study of the whole order of things

      extending even to prophecy and medicine which gives health out of these

      divine elements deriving what was needful for human life and adding every

      sort of knowledge which was akin to them all this order and arrangement

      the goddess first imparted to you when establishing your city and she

      chose the spot of earth in which you were born because she saw that the

      happy temperament of the seasons in that land would produce the wisest of

      men wherefore the goddess who was a lover both of war and of wisdom

      selected and first of all settled that spot which was the most likely to

      produce men likest herself and there you dwelt having such laws as these

      and still better ones and excelled all mankind in all virtue as became

      the children and disciples of the gods

    


      many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your state in our

      histories but one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valour

      for these histories tell of a mighty power which unprovoked made an

      expedition against the whole of europe and asia and to which your city

      put an end this power came forth out of the atlantic ocean for in those

      days the atlantic was navigable and there was an island situated in front

      of the straits which are by you called the pillars of heracles the island

      was larger than libya and asia put together and was the way to other

      islands and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite

      continent which surrounded the true ocean for this sea which is within

      the straits of heracles is only a harbour having a narrow entrance but

      that other is a real sea and the surrounding land may be most truly

      called a boundless continent now in this island of atlantis there was a

      great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and

      several others and over parts of the continent and furthermore the men

      of atlantis had subjected the parts of libya within the columns of

      heracles as far as egypt and of europe as far as tyrrhenia this vast

      power gathered into one endeavoured to subdue at a blow our country and

      yours and the whole of the region within the straits and then solon

      your country shone forth in the excellence of her virtue and strength

      among all mankind she was preeminent in courage and military skill and

      was the leader of the hellenes and when the rest fell off from her being

      compelled to stand alone after having undergone the very extremity of

      danger she defeated and triumphed over the invaders and preserved from

      slavery those who were not yet subjugated and generously liberated all

      the rest of us who dwell within the pillars but afterwards there occurred

      violent earthquakes and floods and in a single day and night of

      misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth and the

      island of atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea

      for which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable

      because there is a shoal of mud in the way and this was caused by the

      subsidence of the island

    


      i have told you briefly socrates what the aged critias heard from solon

      and related to us and when you were speaking yesterday about your city

      and citizens the tale which i have just been repeating to you came into

      my mind and i remarked with astonishment how by some mysterious

      coincidence you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of

      solon but i did not like to speak at the moment for a long time had

      elapsed and i had forgotten too much i thought that i must first of all

      run over the narrative in my own mind and then i would speak and so i

      readily assented to your request yesterday considering that in all such

      cases the chief difficulty is to find a tale suitable to our purpose and

      that with such a tale we should be fairly well provided

    


      and therefore as hermocrates has told you on my way home yesterday i at

      once communicated the tale to my companions as i remembered it and after

      i left them during the night by thinking i recovered nearly the whole of

      it truly as is often said the lessons of our childhood make a wonderful

      impression on our memories for i am not sure that i could remember all

      the discourse of yesterday but i should be much surprised if i forgot any

      of these things which i have heard very long ago i listened at the time

      with childlike interest to the old mans narrative he was very ready to

      teach me and i asked him again and again to repeat his words so that

      like an indelible picture they were branded into my mind as soon as the

      day broke i rehearsed them as he spoke them to my companions that they

      as well as myself might have something to say and now socrates to make

      an end of my preface i am ready to tell you the whole tale i will give

      you not only the general heads but the particulars as they were told to

      me the city and citizens which you yesterday described to us in fiction

      we will now transfer to the world of reality it shall be the ancient city

      of athens and we will suppose that the citizens whom you imagined were

      our veritable ancestors of whom the priest spoke they will perfectly

      harmonize and there will be no inconsistency in saying that the citizens

      of your republic are these ancient athenians let us divide the subject

      among us and all endeavour according to our ability gracefully to execute

      the task which you have imposed upon us consider then socrates if this

      narrative is suited to the purpose or whether we should seek for some

      other instead

    


      socrates and what other critias can we find that will be better than

      this which is natural and suitable to the festival of the goddess and

      has the very great advantage of being a fact and not a fiction how or

      where shall we find another if we abandon this we cannot and therefore

      you must tell the tale and good luck to you and i in return for my

      yesterdays discourse will now rest and be a listener

    


      critias let me proceed to explain to you socrates the order in which we

      have arranged our entertainment our intention is that timaeus who is

      the most of an astronomer amongst us and has made the nature of the

      universe his special study should speak first beginning with the

      generation of the world and going down to the creation of man next i am

      to receive the men whom he has created and of whom some will have

      profited by the excellent education which you have given them and then

      in accordance with the tale of solon and equally with his law we will

      bring them into court and make them citizens as if they were those very

      athenians whom the sacred egyptian record has recovered from oblivion and

      thenceforward we will speak of them as athenians and fellowcitizens

    


      socrates i see that i shall receive in my turn a perfect and splendid

      feast of reason and now timaeus you i suppose should speak next

      after duly calling upon the gods

    


      timaeus all men socrates who have any degree of right feeling at the

      beginning of every enterprise whether small or great always call upon

      god and we too who are going to discourse of the nature of the

      universe how created or how existing without creation if we be not

      altogether out of our wits must invoke the aid of gods and goddesses and

      pray that our words may be acceptable to them and consistent with

      themselves let this then be our invocation of the gods to which i add

      an exhortation of myself to speak in such manner as will be most

      intelligible to you and will most accord with my own intent

    


      first then in my judgment we must make a distinction and ask what is

      that which always is and has no becoming and what is that which is always

      becoming and never is that which is apprehended by intelligence and

      reason is always in the same state but that which is conceived by opinion

      with the help of sensation and without reason is always in a process of

      becoming and perishing and never really is now everything that becomes or

      is created must of necessity be created by some cause for without a cause

      nothing can be created the work of the creator whenever he looks to the

      unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an

      unchangeable pattern must necessarily be made fair and perfect but when

      he looks to the created only and uses a created pattern it is not fair

      or perfect was the heaven then or the world whether called by this or by

      any other more appropriate nameassuming the name i am asking a

      question which has to be asked at the beginning of an enquiry about

      anythingwas the world i say always in existence and without

      beginning or created and had it a beginning created i reply being

      visible and tangible and having a body and therefore sensible and all

      sensible things are apprehended by opinion and sense and are in a process

      of creation and created now that which is created must as we affirm of

      necessity be created by a cause but the father and maker of all this

      universe is past finding out and even if we found him to tell of him to

      all men would be impossible and there is still a question to be asked

      about him which of the patterns had the artificer in view when he made

      the worldthe pattern of the unchangeable or of that which is

      created if the world be indeed fair and the artificer good it is

      manifest that he must have looked to that which is eternal but if what

      cannot be said without blasphemy is true then to the created pattern

      every one will see that he must have looked to the eternal for the world

      is the fairest of creations and he is the best of causes and having been

      created in this way the world has been framed in the likeness of that

      which is apprehended by reason and mind and is unchangeable and must

      therefore of necessity if this is admitted be a copy of something now

      it is allimportant that the beginning of everything should be according

      to nature and in speaking of the copy and the original we may assume that

      words are akin to the matter which they describe when they relate to the

      lasting and permanent and intelligible they ought to be lasting and

      unalterable and as far as their nature allows irrefutable and immovablenothing

      less but when they express only the copy or likeness and not the eternal

      things themselves they need only be likely and analogous to the real

      words as being is to becoming so is truth to belief if then socrates

      amid the many opinions about the gods and the generation of the universe

      we are not able to give notions which are altogether and in every respect

      exact and consistent with one another do not be surprised enough if we

      adduce probabilities as likely as any others for we must remember that i

      who am the speaker and you who are the judges are only mortal men and

      we ought to accept the tale which is probable and enquire no further

    


      socrates excellent timaeus and we will do precisely as you bid us the

      prelude is charming and is already accepted by usmay we beg of you

      to proceed to the strain

    


      timaeus let me tell you then why the creator made this world of

      generation he was good and the good can never have any jealousy of

      anything and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should

      be as like himself as they could be this is in the truest sense the

      origin of creation and of the world as we shall do well in believing on

      the testimony of wise men god desired that all things should be good and

      nothing bad so far as this was attainable wherefore also finding the

      whole visible sphere not at rest but moving in an irregular and

      disorderly fashion out of disorder he brought order considering that

      this was in every way better than the other now the deeds of the best

      could never be or have been other than the fairest and the creator

      reflecting on the things which are by nature visible found that no

      unintelligent creature taken as a whole was fairer than the intelligent

      taken as a whole and that intelligence could not be present in anything

      which was devoid of soul for which reason when he was framing the

      universe he put intelligence in soul and soul in body that he might be

      the creator of a work which was by nature fairest and best wherefore

      using the language of probability we may say that the world became a

      living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence

      of god

    


      this being supposed let us proceed to the next stage in the likeness of

      what animal did the creator make the world it would be an unworthy thing

      to liken it to any nature which exists as a part only for nothing can be

      beautiful which is like any imperfect thing but let us suppose the world

      to be the very image of that whole of which all other animals both

      individually and in their tribes are portions for the original of the

      universe contains in itself all intelligible beings just as this world

      comprehends us and all other visible creatures for the deity intending

      to make this world like the fairest and most perfect of intelligible

      beings framed one visible animal comprehending within itself all other

      animals of a kindred nature are we right in saying that there is one

      world or that they are many and infinite there must be one only if the

      created copy is to accord with the original for that which includes all

      other intelligible creatures cannot have a second or companion in that

      case there would be need of another living being which would include both

      and of which they would be parts and the likeness would be more truly

      said to resemble not them but that other which included them in order

      then that the world might be solitary like the perfect animal the

      creator made not two worlds or an infinite number of them but there is

      and ever will be one onlybegotten and created heaven

    


      now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and also visible and

      tangible and nothing is visible where there is no fire or tangible which

      has no solidity and nothing is solid without earth wherefore also god in

      the beginning of creation made the body of the universe to consist of fire

      and earth but two things cannot be rightly put together without a third

      there must be some bond of union between them and the fairest bond is

      that which makes the most complete fusion of itself and the things which

      it combines and proportion is best adapted to effect such a union for

      whenever in any three numbers whether cube or square there is a mean

      which is to the last term what the first term is to it and again when

      the mean is to the first term as the last term is to the meanthen

      the mean becoming first and last and the first and last both becoming

      means they will all of them of necessity come to be the same and having

      become the same with one another will be all one if the universal frame

      had been created a surface only and having no depth a single mean would

      have sufficed to bind together itself and the other terms but now as the

      world must be solid and solid bodies are always compacted not by one mean

      but by two god placed water and air in the mean between fire and earth

      and made them to have the same proportion so far as was possible as fire

      is to air so is air to water and as air is to water so is water to

      earth and thus he bound and put together a visible and tangible heaven

      and for these reasons and out of such elements which are in number four

      the body of the world was created and it was harmonized by proportion

      and therefore has the spirit of friendship and having been reconciled to

      itself it was indissoluble by the hand of any other than the framer

    


      now the creation took up the whole of each of the four elements for the

      creator compounded the world out of all the fire and all the water and all

      the air and all the earth leaving no part of any of them nor any power of

      them outside his intention was in the first place that the animal

      should be as far as possible a perfect whole and of perfect parts

      secondly that it should be one leaving no remnants out of which another

      such world might be created and also that it should be free from old age

      and unaffected by disease considering that if heat and cold and other

      powerful forces which unite bodies surround and attack them from without

      when they are unprepared they decompose them and by bringing diseases

      and old age upon them make them waste awayfor this cause and on

      these grounds he made the world one whole having every part entire and

      being therefore perfect and not liable to old age and disease and he gave

      to the world the figure which was suitable and also natural now to the

      animal which was to comprehend all animals that figure was suitable which

      comprehends within itself all other figures wherefore he made the world

      in the form of a globe round as from a lathe having its extremes in

      every direction equidistant from the centre the most perfect and the most

      like itself of all figures for he considered that the like is infinitely

      fairer than the unlike this he finished off making the surface smooth

      all round for many reasons in the first place because the living being

      had no need of eyes when there was nothing remaining outside him to be

      seen nor of ears when there was nothing to be heard and there was no

      surrounding atmosphere to be breathed nor would there have been any use

      of organs by the help of which he might receive his food or get rid of

      what he had already digested since there was nothing which went from him

      or came into him for there was nothing beside him of design he was

      created thus his own waste providing his own food and all that he did or

      suffered taking place in and by himself for the creator conceived that a

      being which was selfsufficient would be far more excellent than one which

      lacked anything and as he had no need to take anything or defend himself

      against any one the creator did not think it necessary to bestow upon him

      hands nor had he any need of feet nor of the whole apparatus of walking

      but the movement suited to his spherical form was assigned to him being

      of all the seven that which is most appropriate to mind and intelligence

      and he was made to move in the same manner and on the same spot within

      his own limits revolving in a circle all the other six motions were taken

      away from him and he was made not to partake of their deviations and as

      this circular movement required no feet the universe was created without

      legs and without feet

    


      such was the whole plan of the eternal god about the god that was to be

      to whom for this reason he gave a body smooth and even having a surface

      in every direction equidistant from the centre a body entire and perfect

      and formed out of perfect bodies and in the centre he put the soul which

      he diffused throughout the body making it also to be the exterior

      environment of it and he made the universe a circle moving in a circle

      one and solitary yet by reason of its excellence able to converse with

      itself and needing no other friendship or acquaintance having these

      purposes in view he created the world a blessed god

    


      now god did not make the soul after the body although we are speaking of

      them in this order for having brought them together he would never have

      allowed that the elder should be ruled by the younger but this is a

      random manner of speaking which we have because somehow we ourselves too

      are very much under the dominion of chance whereas he made the soul in

      origin and excellence prior to and older than the body to be the ruler

      and mistress of whom the body was to be the subject and he made her out

      of the following elements and on this wise out of the indivisible and

      unchangeable and also out of that which is divisible and has to do with

      material bodies he compounded a third and intermediate kind of essence

      partaking of the nature of the same and of the other and this compound he

      placed accordingly in a mean between the indivisible and the divisible

      and material he took the three elements of the same the other and the

      essence and mingled them into one form compressing by force the

      reluctant and unsociable nature of the other into the same when he had

      mingled them with the essence and out of three made one he again divided

      this whole into as many portions as was fitting each portion being a

      compound of the same the other and the essence and he proceeded to

      divide after this mannerfirst of all he took away one part of the

      whole  and then he separated a second part which was double the first

       and then he took away a third part which was half as much again as

      the second and three times as much as the first  and then he took a

      fourth part which was twice as much as the second  and a fifth part

      which was three times the third  and a sixth part which was eight

      times the first  and a seventh part which was twentyseven times the

      first  after this he filled up the double intervals ie between 

         and the triple ie between     cutting off yet other

      portions from the mixture and placing them in the intervals so that in

      each interval there were two kinds of means the one exceeding and

      exceeded by equal parts of its extremes as for example    in

      which the mean  is onethird of  more than  and onethird of  less

      than  the other being that kind of mean which exceeds and is exceeded

      by an equal number eg

    


   over     over     over      over  and

   over       over     over     over 




      where there were intervals of  and of  and of  made by the

      connecting terms in the former intervals he filled up all the intervals

      of  with the interval of  leaving a fraction over and the interval

      which this fraction expressed was in the ratio of  to  eg

    


 




      and thus the whole mixture out of which he cut these portions was all

      exhausted by him this entire compound he divided lengthways into two

      parts which he joined to one another at the centre like the letter x and

      bent them into a circular form connecting them with themselves and each

      other at the point opposite to their original meetingpoint and

      comprehending them in a uniform revolution upon the same axis he made the

      one the outer and the other the inner circle now the motion of the outer

      circle he called the motion of the same and the motion of the inner

      circle the motion of the other or diverse the motion of the same he

      carried round by the side ie of the rectangular figure supposed to be

      inscribed in the circle of the same to the right and the motion of the

      diverse diagonally ie across the rectangular figure from corner to

      corner to the left and he gave dominion to the motion of the same and

      like for that he left single and undivided but the inner motion he

      divided in six places and made seven unequal circles having their

      intervals in ratios of two and three three of each and bade the orbits

      proceed in a direction opposite to one another and three sun mercury

      venus he made to move with equal swiftness and the remaining four moon

      saturn mars jupiter to move with unequal swiftness to the three and to

      one another but in due proportion

    


      now when the creator had framed the soul according to his will he formed

      within her the corporeal universe and brought the two together and

      united them centre to centre the soul interfused everywhere from the

      centre to the circumference of heaven of which also she is the external

      envelopment herself turning in herself began a divine beginning of

      neverceasing and rational life enduring throughout all time the body of

      heaven is visible but the soul is invisible and partakes of reason and

      harmony and being made by the best of intellectual and everlasting

      natures is the best of things created and because she is composed of the

      same and of the other and of the essence these three and is divided and

      united in due proportion and in her revolutions returns upon herself the

      soul when touching anything which has essence whether dispersed in parts

      or undivided is stirred through all her powers to declare the sameness

      or difference of that thing and some other and to what individuals are

      related and by what affected and in what way and how and when both in

      the world of generation and in the world of immutable being and when

      reason which works with equal truth whether she be in the circle of the

      diverse or of the samein voiceless silence holding her onward

      course in the sphere of the selfmovedwhen reason i say is

      hovering around the sensible world and when the circle of the diverse also

      moving truly imparts the intimations of sense to the whole soul then

      arise opinions and beliefs sure and certain but when reason is concerned

      with the rational and the circle of the same moving smoothly declares it

      then intelligence and knowledge are necessarily perfected and if any one

      affirms that in which these two are found to be other than the soul he

      will say the very opposite of the truth

    


      when the father and creator saw the creature which he had made moving and

      living the created image of the eternal gods he rejoiced and in his joy

      determined to make the copy still more like the original and as this was

      eternal he sought to make the universe eternal so far as might be now

      the nature of the ideal being was everlasting but to bestow this

      attribute in its fulness upon a creature was impossible wherefore he

      resolved to have a moving image of eternity and when he set in order the

      heaven he made this image eternal but moving according to number while

      eternity itself rests in unity and this image we call time for there

      were no days and nights and months and years before the heaven was

      created but when he constructed the heaven he created them also they are

      all parts of time and the past and future are created species of time

      which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal essence for we

      say that he was he is he will be but the truth is that is alone

      is properly attributed to him and that was and will be are only to be

      spoken of becoming in time for they are motions but that which is

      immovably the same cannot become older or younger by time nor ever did or

      has become or hereafter will be older or younger nor is subject at all

      to any of those states which affect moving and sensible things and of

      which generation is the cause these are the forms of time which imitates

      eternity and revolves according to a law of number moreover when we say

      that what has become is become and what becomes is becoming and that what

      will become is about to become and that the nonexistent is nonexistentall

      these are inaccurate modes of expression compare parmen but perhaps

      this whole subject will be more suitably discussed on some other occasion

    


      time then and the heaven came into being at the same instant in order

      that having been created together if ever there was to be a dissolution

      of them they might be dissolved together it was framed after the pattern

      of the eternal nature that it might resemble this as far as was possible

      for the pattern exists from eternity and the created heaven has been and

      is and will be in all time such was the mind and thought of god in the

      creation of time the sun and moon and five other stars which are called

      the planets were created by him in order to distinguish and preserve the

      numbers of time and when he had made their several bodies he placed them

      in the orbits in which the circle of the other was revolvingin

      seven orbits seven stars first there was the moon in the orbit nearest

      the earth and next the sun in the second orbit above the earth then

      came the morning star and the star sacred to hermes moving in orbits

      which have an equal swiftness with the sun but in an opposite direction

      and this is the reason why the sun and hermes and lucifer overtake and are

      overtaken by each other to enumerate the places which he assigned to the

      other stars and to give all the reasons why he assigned them although a

      secondary matter would give more trouble than the primary these things

      at some future time when we are at leisure may have the consideration

      which they deserve but not at present

    


      now when all the stars which were necessary to the creation of time had

      attained a motion suitable to them and had become living creatures having

      bodies fastened by vital chains and learnt their appointed task moving

      in the motion of the diverse which is diagonal and passes through and is

      governed by the motion of the same they revolved some in a larger and

      some in a lesser orbitthose which had the lesser orbit revolving

      faster and those which had the larger more slowly now by reason of the

      motion of the same those which revolved fastest appeared to be overtaken

      by those which moved slower although they really overtook them for the

      motion of the same made them all turn in a spiral and because some went

      one way and some another that which receded most slowly from the sphere

      of the same which was the swiftest appeared to follow it most nearly

      that there might be some visible measure of their relative swiftness and

      slowness as they proceeded in their eight courses god lighted a fire

      which we now call the sun in the second from the earth of these orbits

      that it might give light to the whole of heaven and that the animals as

      many as nature intended might participate in number learning arithmetic

      from the revolution of the same and the like thus then and for this

      reason the night and the day were created being the period of the one

      most intelligent revolution and the month is accomplished when the moon

      has completed her orbit and overtaken the sun and the year when the sun

      has completed his own orbit mankind with hardly an exception have not

      remarked the periods of the other stars and they have no name for them

      and do not measure them against one another by the help of number and

      hence they can scarcely be said to know that their wanderings being

      infinite in number and admirable for their variety make up time and yet

      there is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of time fulfils

      the perfect year when all the eight revolutions having their relative

      degrees of swiftness are accomplished together and attain their

      completion at the same time measured by the rotation of the same and

      equally moving after this manner and for these reasons came into being

      such of the stars as in their heavenly progress received reversals of

      motion to the end that the created heaven might imitate the eternal

      nature and be as like as possible to the perfect and intelligible animal

    


      thus far and until the birth of time the created universe was made in the

      likeness of the original but inasmuch as all animals were not yet

      comprehended therein it was still unlike what remained the creator then

      proceeded to fashion after the nature of the pattern now as in the ideal

      animal the mind perceives ideas or species of a certain nature and number

      he thought that this created animal ought to have species of a like nature

      and number there are four such one of them is the heavenly race of the

      gods another the race of birds whose way is in the air the third the

      watery species and the fourth the pedestrian and land creatures of the

      heavenly and divine he created the greater part out of fire that they

      might be the brightest of all things and fairest to behold and he

      fashioned them after the likeness of the universe in the figure of a

      circle and made them follow the intelligent motion of the supreme

      distributing them over the whole circumference of heaven which was to be

      a true cosmos or glorious world spangled with them all over and he gave

      to each of them two movements the first a movement on the same spot

      after the same manner whereby they ever continue to think consistently

      the same thoughts about the same things the second a forward movement

      in which they are controlled by the revolution of the same and the like

      but by the other five motions they were unaffected in order that each of

      them might attain the highest perfection and for this reason the fixed

      stars were created to be divine and eternal animals everabiding and

      revolving after the same manner and on the same spot and the other stars

      which reverse their motion and are subject to deviations of this kind

      were created in the manner already described the earth which is our

      nurse clinging or circling around the pole which is extended through

      the universe he framed to be the guardian and artificer of night and day

      first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven vain would be

      the attempt to tell all the figures of them circling as in dance and

      their juxtapositions and the return of them in their revolutions upon

      themselves and their approximations and to say which of these deities in

      their conjunctions meet and which of them are in opposition and in what

      order they get behind and before one another and when they are severally

      eclipsed to our sight and again reappear sending terrors and intimations

      of the future to those who cannot calculate their movementsto

      attempt to tell of all this without a visible representation of the

      heavenly system would be labour in vain enough on this head and now let

      what we have said about the nature of the created and visible gods have an

      end

    


      to know or tell the origin of the other divinities is beyond us and we

      must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to

      be the offspring of the godsthat is what they sayand they

      must surely have known their own ancestors how can we doubt the word of

      the children of the gods although they give no probable or certain

      proofs still as they declare that they are speaking of what took place

      in their own family we must conform to custom and believe them in this

      manner then according to them the genealogy of these gods is to be

      received and set forth

    


      oceanus and tethys were the children of earth and heaven and from these

      sprang phorcys and cronos and rhea and all that generation and from

      cronos and rhea sprang zeus and here and all those who are said to be

      their brethren and others who were the children of these

    


      now when all of them both those who visibly appear in their revolutions

      as well as those other gods who are of a more retiring nature had come

      into being the creator of the universe addressed them in these words

      gods children of gods who are my works and of whom i am the artificer

      and father my creations are indissoluble if so i will all that is bound

      may be undone but only an evil being would wish to undo that which is

      harmonious and happy wherefore since ye are but creatures ye are not

      altogether immortal and indissoluble but ye shall certainly not be

      dissolved nor be liable to the fate of death having in my will a greater

      and mightier bond than those with which ye were bound at the time of your

      birth and now listen to my instructionsthree tribes of mortal

      beings remain to be createdwithout them the universe will be

      incomplete for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to

      contain if it is to be perfect on the other hand if they were created

      by me and received life at my hands they would be on an equality with the

      gods in order then that they may be mortal and that this universe may be

      truly universal do ye according to your natures betake yourselves to

      the formation of animals imitating the power which was shown by me in

      creating you the part of them worthy of the name immortal which is

      called divine and is the guiding principle of those who are willing to

      follow justice and youof that divine part i will myself sow the

      seed and having made a beginning i will hand the work over to you and

      do ye then interweave the mortal with the immortal and make and beget

      living creatures and give them food and make them to grow and receive

      them again in death

    


      thus he spake and once more into the cup in which he had previously

      mingled the soul of the universe he poured the remains of the elements

      and mingled them in much the same manner they were not however pure as

      before but diluted to the second and third degree and having made it he

      divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the stars and

      assigned each soul to a star and having there placed them as in a

      chariot he showed them the nature of the universe and declared to them

      the laws of destiny according to which their first birth would be one and

      the same for allno one should suffer a disadvantage at his hands

      they were to be sown in the instruments of time severally adapted to them

      and to come forth the most religious of animals and as human nature was

      of two kinds the superior race would hereafter be called man now when

      they should be implanted in bodies by necessity and be always gaining or

      losing some part of their bodily substance then in the first place it

      would be necessary that they should all have in them one and the same

      faculty of sensation arising out of irresistible impressions in the

      second place they must have love in which pleasure and pain mingle also

      fear and anger and the feelings which are akin or opposite to them if

      they conquered these they would live righteously and if they were

      conquered by them unrighteously he who lived well during his appointed

      time was to return and dwell in his native star and there he would have a

      blessed and congenial existence but if he failed in attaining this at

      the second birth he would pass into a woman and if when in that state of

      being he did not desist from evil he would continually be changed into

      some brute who resembled him in the evil nature which he had acquired and

      would not cease from his toils and transformations until he followed the

      revolution of the same and the like within him and overcame by the help

      of reason the turbulent and irrational mob of later accretions made up of

      fire and air and water and earth and returned to the form of his first

      and better state having given all these laws to his creatures that he

      might be guiltless of future evil in any of them the creator sowed some

      of them in the earth and some in the moon and some in the other

      instruments of time and when he had sown them he committed to the younger

      gods the fashioning of their mortal bodies and desired them to furnish

      what was still lacking to the human soul and having made all the suitable

      additions to rule over them and to pilot the mortal animal in the best

      and wisest manner which they could and avert from him all but

      selfinflicted evils

    


      when the creator had made all these ordinances he remained in his own

      accustomed nature and his children heard and were obedient to their

      fathers word and receiving from him the immortal principle of a mortal

      creature in imitation of their own creator they borrowed portions of

      fire and earth and water and air from the world which were hereafter

      to be restoredthese they took and welded them together not with

      the indissoluble chains by which they were themselves bound but with

      little pegs too small to be visible making up out of all the four

      elements each separate body and fastening the courses of the immortal

      soul in a body which was in a state of perpetual influx and efflux now

      these courses detained as in a vast river neither overcame nor were

      overcome but were hurrying and hurried to and fro so that the whole

      animal was moved and progressed irregularly however and irrationally and

      anyhow in all the six directions of motion wandering backwards and

      forwards and right and left and up and down and in all the six

      directions for great as was the advancing and retiring flood which

      provided nourishment the affections produced by external contact caused

      still greater tumultwhen the body of any one met and came into

      collision with some external fire or with the solid earth or the gliding

      waters or was caught in the tempest borne on the air and the motions

      produced by any of these impulses were carried through the body to the

      soul all such motions have consequently received the general name of

      sensations which they still retain and they did in fact at that time

      create a very great and mighty movement uniting with the everflowing

      stream in stirring up and violently shaking the courses of the soul they

      completely stopped the revolution of the same by their opposing current

      and hindered it from predominating and advancing and they so disturbed

      the nature of the other or diverse that the three double intervals ie

      between     and the three triple intervals ie between   

       together with the mean terms and connecting links which are expressed

      by the ratios of  and  and of these although they

      cannot be wholly undone except by him who united them were twisted by

      them in all sorts of ways and the circles were broken and disordered in

      every possible manner so that when they moved they were tumbling to

      pieces and moved irrationally at one time in a reverse direction and

      then again obliquely and then upside down as you might imagine a person

      who is upside down and has his head leaning upon the ground and his feet

      up against something in the air and when he is in such a position both

      he and the spectator fancy that the right of either is his left and the

      left right if when powerfully experiencing these and similar effects

      the revolutions of the soul come in contact with some external thing

      either of the class of the same or of the other they speak of the same or

      of the other in a manner the very opposite of the truth and they become

      false and foolish and there is no course or revolution in them which has

      a guiding or directing power and if again any sensations enter in

      violently from without and drag after them the whole vessel of the soul

      then the courses of the soul though they seem to conquer are really

      conquered

    


      and by reason of all these affections the soul when encased in a mortal

      body now as in the beginning is at first without intelligence but when

      the flood of growth and nutriment abates and the courses of the soul

      calming down go their own way and become steadier as time goes on then

      the several circles return to their natural form and their revolutions

      are corrected and they call the same and the other by their right names

      and make the possessor of them to become a rational being and if these

      combine in him with any true nurture or education he attains the fulness

      and health of the perfect man and escapes the worst disease of all but

      if he neglects education he walks lame to the end of his life and returns

      imperfect and good for nothing to the world below this however is a

      later stage at present we must treat more exactly the subject before us

      which involves a preliminary enquiry into the generation of the body and

      its members and as to how the soul was createdfor what reason and

      by what providence of the gods and holding fast to probability we must

      pursue our way

    


      first then the gods imitating the spherical shape of the universe

      enclosed the two divine courses in a spherical body that namely which

      we now term the head being the most divine part of us and the lord of all

      that is in us to this the gods when they put together the body gave all

      the other members to be servants considering that it partook of every

      sort of motion in order then that it might not tumble about among the

      high and deep places of the earth but might be able to get over the one

      and out of the other they provided the body to be its vehicle and means

      of locomotion which consequently had length and was furnished with four

      limbs extended and flexible these god contrived to be instruments of

      locomotion with which it might take hold and find support and so be able

      to pass through all places carrying on high the dwellingplace of the

      most sacred and divine part of us such was the origin of legs and hands

      which for this reason were attached to every man and the gods deeming

      the front part of man to be more honourable and more fit to command than

      the hinder part made us to move mostly in a forward direction wherefore

      man must needs have his front part unlike and distinguished from the rest

      of his body

    


      and so in the vessel of the head they first of all put a face in which

      they inserted organs to minister in all things to the providence of the

      soul and they appointed this part which has authority to be by nature

      the part which is in front and of the organs they first contrived the

      eyes to give light and the principle according to which they were

      inserted was as follows so much of fire as would not burn but gave a

      gentle light they formed into a substance akin to the light of everyday

      life and the pure fire which is within us and related thereto they made

      to flow through the eyes in a stream smooth and dense compressing the

      whole eye and especially the centre part so that it kept out everything

      of a coarser nature and allowed to pass only this pure element when the

      light of day surrounds the stream of vision then like falls upon like

      and they coalesce and one body is formed by natural affinity in the line

      of vision wherever the light that falls from within meets with an

      external object and the whole stream of vision being similarly affected

      in virtue of similarity diffuses the motions of what it touches or what

      touches it over the whole body until they reach the soul causing that

      perception which we call sight but when night comes on and the external

      and kindred fire departs then the stream of vision is cut off for going

      forth to an unlike element it is changed and extinguished being no longer

      of one nature with the surrounding atmosphere which is now deprived of

      fire and so the eye no longer sees and we feel disposed to sleep for

      when the eyelids which the gods invented for the preservation of sight

      are closed they keep in the internal fire and the power of the fire

      diffuses and equalizes the inward motions when they are equalized there

      is rest and when the rest is profound sleep comes over us scarce

      disturbed by dreams but where the greater motions still remain of

      whatever nature and in whatever locality they engender corresponding

      visions in dreams which are remembered by us when we are awake and in the

      external world and now there is no longer any difficulty in understanding

      the creation of images in mirrors and all smooth and bright surfaces for

      from the communion of the internal and external fires and again from the

      union of them and their numerous transformations when they meet in the

      mirror all these appearances of necessity arise when the fire from the

      face coalesces with the fire from the eye on the bright and smooth

      surface and right appears left and left right because the visual rays

      come into contact with the rays emitted by the object in a manner contrary

      to the usual mode of meeting but the right appears right and the left

      left when the position of one of the two concurring lights is reversed

      and this happens when the mirror is concave and its smooth surface repels

      the right stream of vision to the left side and the left to the right he

      is speaking of two kinds of mirrors first the plane secondly the

      concave and the latter is supposed to be placed first horizontally and

      then vertically or if the mirror be turned vertically then the

      concavity makes the countenance appear to be all upside down and the

      lower rays are driven upwards and the upper downwards

    


      all these are to be reckoned among the second and cooperative causes

      which god carrying into execution the idea of the best as far as

      possible uses as his ministers they are thought by most men not to be

      the second but the prime causes of all things because they freeze and

      heat and contract and dilate and the like but they are not so for they

      are incapable of reason or intellect the only being which can properly

      have mind is the invisible soul whereas fire and water and earth and

      air are all of them visible bodies the lover of intellect and knowledge

      ought to explore causes of intelligent nature first of all and secondly

      of those things which being moved by others are compelled to move

      others and this is what we too must do both kinds of causes should be

      acknowledged by us but a distinction should be made between those which

      are endowed with mind and are the workers of things fair and good and

      those which are deprived of intelligence and always produce chance effects

      without order or design of the second or cooperative causes of sight

      which help to give to the eyes the power which they now possess enough

      has been said i will therefore now proceed to speak of the higher use and

      purpose for which god has given them to us the sight in my opinion is the

      source of the greatest benefit to us for had we never seen the stars and

      the sun and the heaven none of the words which we have spoken about the

      universe would ever have been uttered but now the sight of day and night

      and the months and the revolutions of the years have created number and

      have given us a conception of time and the power of enquiring about the

      nature of the universe and from this source we have derived philosophy

      than which no greater good ever was or will be given by the gods to mortal

      man this is the greatest boon of sight and of the lesser benefits why

      should i speak even the ordinary man if he were deprived of them would

      bewail his loss but in vain thus much let me say however god invented

      and gave us sight to the end that we might behold the courses of

      intelligence in the heaven and apply them to the courses of our own

      intelligence which are akin to them the unperturbed to the perturbed and

      that we learning them and partaking of the natural truth of reason might

      imitate the absolutely unerring courses of god and regulate our own

      vagaries the same may be affirmed of speech and hearing they have been

      given by the gods to the same end and for a like reason for this is the

      principal end of speech whereto it most contributes moreover so much of

      music as is adapted to the sound of the voice and to the sense of hearing

      is granted to us for the sake of harmony and harmony which has motions

      akin to the revolutions of our souls is not regarded by the intelligent

      votary of the muses as given by them with a view to irrational pleasure

      which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our day but as meant to

      correct any discord which may have arisen in the courses of the soul and

      to be our ally in bringing her into harmony and agreement with herself

      and rhythm too was given by them for the same reason on account of the

      irregular and graceless ways which prevail among mankind generally and to

      help us against them

    


      thus far in what we have been saying with small exception the works of

      intelligence have been set forth and now we must place by the side of

      them in our discourse the things which come into being through necessityfor

      the creation is mixed being made up of necessity and mind mind the

      ruling power persuaded necessity to bring the greater part of created

      things to perfection and thus and after this manner in the beginning

      when the influence of reason got the better of necessity the universe was

      created but if a person will truly tell of the way in which the work was

      accomplished he must include the other influence of the variable cause as

      well wherefore we must return again and find another suitable beginning

      as about the former matters so also about these to which end we must

      consider the nature of fire and water and air and earth such as they

      were prior to the creation of the heaven and what was happening to them

      in this previous state for no one has as yet explained the manner of

      their generation but we speak of fire and the rest of them whatever they

      mean as though men knew their natures and we maintain them to be the

      first principles and letters or elements of the whole when they cannot

      reasonably be compared by a man of any sense even to syllables or first

      compounds and let me say thus much i will not now speak of the first

      principle or principles of all things or by whatever name they are to be

      called for this reasonbecause it is difficult to set forth my

      opinion according to the method of discussion which we are at present

      employing do not imagine any more than i can bring myself to imagine

      that i should be right in undertaking so great and difficult a task

      remembering what i said at first about probability i will do my best to

      give as probable an explanation as any otheror rather more

      probable and i will first go back to the beginning and try to speak of

      each thing and of all once more then at the commencement of my

      discourse i call upon god and beg him to be our saviour out of a strange

      and unwonted enquiry and to bring us to the haven of probability so now

      let us begin again

    


      this new beginning of our discussion of the universe requires a fuller

      division than the former for then we made two classes now a third must

      be revealed the two sufficed for the former discussion one which we

      assumed was a pattern intelligible and always the same and the second

      was only the imitation of the pattern generated and visible there is

      also a third kind which we did not distinguish at the time conceiving

      that the two would be enough but now the argument seems to require that

      we should set forth in words another kind which is difficult of

      explanation and dimly seen what nature are we to attribute to this new

      kind of being we reply that it is the receptacle and in a manner the

      nurse of all generation i have spoken the truth but i must express

      myself in clearer language and this will be an arduous task for many

      reasons and in particular because i must first raise questions concerning

      fire and the other elements and determine what each of them is for to

      say with any probability or certitude which of them should be called

      water rather than fire and which should be called any of them rather than

      all or some one of them is a difficult matter how then shall we settle

      this point and what questions about the elements may be fairly raised

    


      in the first place we see that what we just now called water by

      condensation i suppose becomes stone and earth and this same element

      when melted and dispersed passes into vapour and air air again when

      inflamed becomes fire and again fire when condensed and extinguished

      passes once more into the form of air and once more air when collected

      and condensed produces cloud and mist and from these when still more

      compressed comes flowing water and from water comes earth and stones

      once more and thus generation appears to be transmitted from one to the

      other in a circle thus then as the several elements never present

      themselves in the same form how can any one have the assurance to assert

      positively that any of them whatever it may be is one thing rather than

      another no one can but much the safest plan is to speak of them as

      followsanything which we see to be continually changing as for

      example fire we must not call this or that but rather say that it

      is of such a nature nor let us speak of water as this but always as

      such nor must we imply that there is any stability in any of those

      things which we indicate by the use of the words this and that

      supposing ourselves to signify something thereby for they are too

      volatile to be detained in any such expressions as this or that or

      relative to this or any other mode of speaking which represents them as

      permanent we ought not to apply this to any of them but rather the

      word such which expresses the similar principle circulating in each and

      all of them for example that should be called fire which is of such a

      nature always and so of everything that has generation that in which the

      elements severally grow up and appear and decay is alone to be called

      by the name this or that but that which is of a certain nature hot

      or white or anything which admits of opposite qualities and all things

      that are compounded of them ought not to be so denominated let me make

      another attempt to explain my meaning more clearly suppose a person to

      make all kinds of figures of gold and to be always transmuting one form

      into all the restsomebody points to one of them and asks what it

      is by far the safest and truest answer is that is gold and not to call

      the triangle or any other figures which are formed in the gold these as

      though they had existence since they are in process of change while he is

      making the assertion but if the questioner be willing to take the safe

      and indefinite expression such we should be satisfied and the same

      argument applies to the universal nature which receives all bodiesthat

      must be always called the same for while receiving all things she never

      departs at all from her own nature and never in any way or at any time

      assumes a form like that of any of the things which enter into her she is

      the natural recipient of all impressions and is stirred and informed by

      them and appears different from time to time by reason of them but the

      forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses of real

      existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable

      manner which we will hereafter investigate for the present we have only

      to conceive of three natures first that which is in process of

      generation secondly that in which the generation takes place and

      thirdly that of which the thing generated is a resemblance and we may

      liken the receiving principle to a mother and the source or spring to a

      father and the intermediate nature to a child and may remark further

      that if the model is to take every variety of form then the matter in

      which the model is fashioned will not be duly prepared unless it is

      formless and free from the impress of any of those shapes which it is

      hereafter to receive from without for if the matter were like any of the

      supervening forms then whenever any opposite or entirely different nature

      was stamped upon its surface it would take the impression badly because

      it would intrude its own shape wherefore that which is to receive all

      forms should have no form as in making perfumes they first contrive that

      the liquid substance which is to receive the scent shall be as inodorous

      as possible or as those who wish to impress figures on soft substances do

      not allow any previous impression to remain but begin by making the

      surface as even and smooth as possible in the same way that which is to

      receive perpetually and through its whole extent the resemblances of all

      eternal beings ought to be devoid of any particular form wherefore the

      mother and receptacle of all created and visible and in any way sensible

      things is not to be termed earth or air or fire or water or any of

      their compounds or any of the elements from which these are derived but

      is an invisible and formless being which receives all things and in some

      mysterious way partakes of the intelligible and is most incomprehensible

      in saying this we shall not be far wrong as far however as we can

      attain to a knowledge of her from the previous considerations we may

      truly say that fire is that part of her nature which from time to time is

      inflamed and water that which is moistened and that the mother substance

      becomes earth and air in so far as she receives the impressions of them

    


      let us consider this question more precisely is there any selfexistent

      fire and do all those things which we call selfexistent exist or are

      only those things which we see or in some way perceive through the bodily

      organs truly existent and nothing whatever besides them and is all that

      which we call an intelligible essence nothing at all and only a name

      here is a question which we must not leave unexamined or undetermined nor

      must we affirm too confidently that there can be no decision neither must

      we interpolate in our present long discourse a digression equally long

      but if it is possible to set forth a great principle in a few words that

      is just what we want

    


      thus i state my viewif mind and true opinion are two distinct

      classes then i say that there certainly are these selfexistent ideas

      unperceived by sense and apprehended only by the mind if however as

      some say true opinion differs in no respect from mind then everything

      that we perceive through the body is to be regarded as most real and

      certain but we must affirm them to be distinct for they have a distinct

      origin and are of a different nature the one is implanted in us by

      instruction the other by persuasion the one is always accompanied by

      true reason the other is without reason the one cannot be overcome by

      persuasion but the other can and lastly every man may be said to share

      in true opinion but mind is the attribute of the gods and of very few

      men wherefore also we must acknowledge that there is one kind of being

      which is always the same uncreated and indestructible never receiving

      anything into itself from without nor itself going out to any other but

      invisible and imperceptible by any sense and of which the contemplation

      is granted to intelligence only and there is another nature of the same

      name with it and like to it perceived by sense created always in

      motion becoming in place and again vanishing out of place which is

      apprehended by opinion and sense and there is a third nature which is

      space and is eternal and admits not of destruction and provides a home

      for all created things and is apprehended without the help of sense by a

      kind of spurious reason and is hardly real which we beholding as in a

      dream say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and

      occupy a space but that what is neither in heaven nor in earth has no

      existence of these and other things of the same kind relating to the

      true and waking reality of nature we have only this dreamlike sense and

      we are unable to cast off sleep and determine the truth about them for an

      image since the reality after which it is modelled does not belong to

      it and it exists ever as the fleeting shadow of some other must be

      inferred to be in another ie in space grasping existence in some way

      or other or it could not be at all but true and exact reason

      vindicating the nature of true being maintains that while two things

      ie the image and space are different they cannot exist one of them in

      the other and so be one and also two at the same time

    


      thus have i concisely given the result of my thoughts and my verdict is

      that being and space and generation these three existed in their three

      ways before the heaven and that the nurse of generation moistened by

      water and inflamed by fire and receiving the forms of earth and air and

      experiencing all the affections which accompany these presented a strange

      variety of appearances and being full of powers which were neither

      similar nor equally balanced was never in any part in a state of

      equipoise but swaying unevenly hither and thither was shaken by them

      and by its motion again shook them and the elements when moved were

      separated and carried continually some one way some another as when

      grain is shaken and winnowed by fans and other instruments used in the

      threshing of corn the close and heavy particles are borne away and settle

      in one direction and the loose and light particles in another in this

      manner the four kinds or elements were then shaken by the receiving

      vessel which moving like a winnowing machine scattered far away from

      one another the elements most unlike and forced the most similar elements

      into close contact wherefore also the various elements had different

      places before they were arranged so as to form the universe at first

      they were all without reason and measure but when the world began to get

      into order fire and water and earth and air had only certain faint traces

      of themselves and were altogether such as everything might be expected to

      be in the absence of god this i say was their nature at that time and

      god fashioned them by form and number let it be consistently maintained

      by us in all that we say that god made them as far as possible the fairest

      and best out of things which were not fair and good and now i will

      endeavour to show you the disposition and generation of them by an

      unaccustomed argument which i am compelled to use but i believe that you

      will be able to follow me for your education has made you familiar with

      the methods of science

    


      in the first place then as is evident to all fire and earth and water

      and air are bodies and every sort of body possesses solidity and every

      solid must necessarily be contained in planes and every plane rectilinear

      figure is composed of triangles and all triangles are originally of two

      kinds both of which are made up of one right and two acute angles one of

      them has at either end of the base the half of a divided right angle

      having equal sides while in the other the right angle is divided into

      unequal parts having unequal sides these then proceeding by a

      combination of probability with demonstration we assume to be the

      original elements of fire and the other bodies but the principles which

      are prior to these god only knows and he of men who is the friend of god

      and next we have to determine what are the four most beautiful bodies

      which are unlike one another and of which some are capable of resolution

      into one another for having discovered thus much we shall know the true

      origin of earth and fire and of the proportionate and intermediate

      elements and then we shall not be willing to allow that there are any

      distinct kinds of visible bodies fairer than these wherefore we must

      endeavour to construct the four forms of bodies which excel in beauty and

      then we shall be able to say that we have sufficiently apprehended their

      nature now of the two triangles the isosceles has one form only the

      scalene or unequalsided has an infinite number of the infinite forms we

      must select the most beautiful if we are to proceed in due order and any

      one who can point out a more beautiful form than ours for the construction

      of these bodies shall carry off the palm not as an enemy but as a

      friend now the one which we maintain to be the most beautiful of all the

      many triangles and we need not speak of the others is that of which the

      double forms a third triangle which is equilateral the reason of this

      would be long to tell he who disproves what we are saying and shows that

      we are mistaken may claim a friendly victory then let us choose two

      triangles out of which fire and the other elements have been constructed

      one isosceles the other having the square of the longer side equal to

      three times the square of the lesser side

    


      now is the time to explain what was before obscurely said there was an

      error in imagining that all the four elements might be generated by and

      into one another this i say was an erroneous supposition for there are

      generated from the triangles which we have selected four kindsthree

      from the one which has the sides unequal the fourth alone is framed out

      of the isosceles triangle hence they cannot all be resolved into one

      another a great number of small bodies being combined into a few large

      ones or the converse but three of them can be thus resolved and

      compounded for they all spring from one and when the greater bodies are

      broken up many small bodies will spring up out of them and take their own

      proper figures or again when many small bodies are dissolved into their

      triangles if they become one they will form one large mass of another

      kind so much for their passage into one another i have now to speak of

      their several kinds and show out of what combinations of numbers each of

      them was formed the first will be the simplest and smallest construction

      and its element is that triangle which has its hypotenuse twice the lesser

      side when two such triangles are joined at the diagonal and this is

      repeated three times and the triangles rest their diagonals and shorter

      sides on the same point as a centre a single equilateral triangle is

      formed out of six triangles and four equilateral triangles if put

      together make out of every three plane angles one solid angle being that

      which is nearest to the most obtuse of plane angles and out of the

      combination of these four angles arises the first solid form which

      distributes into equal and similar parts the whole circle in which it is

      inscribed the second species of solid is formed out of the same

      triangles which unite as eight equilateral triangles and form one solid

      angle out of four plane angles and out of six such angles the second body

      is completed and the third body is made up of  triangular elements

      forming twelve solid angles each of them included in five plane

      equilateral triangles having altogether twenty bases each of which is an

      equilateral triangle the one element that is the triangle which has its

      hypotenuse twice the lesser side having generated these figures

      generated no more but the isosceles triangle produced the fourth

      elementary figure which is compounded of four such triangles joining

      their right angles in a centre and forming one equilateral quadrangle

      six of these united form eight solid angles each of which is made by the

      combination of three plane right angles the figure of the body thus

      composed is a cube having six plane quadrangular equilateral bases there

      was yet a fifth combination which god used in the delineation of the

      universe

    


      now he who duly reflecting on all this enquires whether the worlds are

      to be regarded as indefinite or definite in number will be of opinion

      that the notion of their indefiniteness is characteristic of a sadly

      indefinite and ignorant mind he however who raises the question whether

      they are to be truly regarded as one or five takes up a more reasonable

      position arguing from probabilities i am of opinion that they are one

      another regarding the question from another point of view will be of

      another mind but leaving this enquiry let us proceed to distribute the

      elementary forms which have now been created in idea among the four

      elements

    


      to earth then let us assign the cubical form for earth is the most

      immoveable of the four and the most plastic of all bodies and that which

      has the most stable bases must of necessity be of such a nature now of

      the triangles which we assumed at first that which has two equal sides is

      by nature more firmly based than that which has unequal sides and of the

      compound figures which are formed out of either the plane equilateral

      quadrangle has necessarily a more stable basis than the equilateral

      triangle both in the whole and in the parts wherefore in assigning this

      figure to earth we adhere to probability and to water we assign that one

      of the remaining forms which is the least moveable and the most moveable

      of them to fire and to air that which is intermediate also we assign the

      smallest body to fire and the greatest to water and the intermediate in

      size to air and again the acutest body to fire and the next in

      acuteness to air and the third to water of all these elements that

      which has the fewest bases must necessarily be the most moveable for it

      must be the acutest and most penetrating in every way and also the

      lightest as being composed of the smallest number of similar particles

      and the second body has similar properties in a second degree and the

      third body in the third degree let it be agreed then both according to

      strict reason and according to probability that the pyramid is the solid

      which is the original element and seed of fire and let us assign the

      element which was next in the order of generation to air and the third to

      water we must imagine all these to be so small that no single particle of

      any of the four kinds is seen by us on account of their smallness but

      when many of them are collected together their aggregates are seen and

      the ratios of their numbers motions and other properties everywhere

      god as far as necessity allowed or gave consent has exactly perfected

      and harmonized in due proportion

    


      from all that we have just been saying about the elements or kinds the

      most probable conclusion is as followsearth when meeting with

      fire and dissolved by its sharpness whether the dissolution take place in

      the fire itself or perhaps in some mass of air or water is borne hither

      and thither until its parts meeting together and mutually harmonising

      again become earth for they can never take any other form but water

      when divided by fire or by air on reforming may become one part fire

      and two parts air and a single volume of air divided becomes two of fire

      again when a small body of fire is contained in a larger body of air or

      water or earth and both are moving and the fire struggling is overcome

      and broken up then two volumes of fire form one volume of air and when

      air is overcome and cut up into small pieces two and a half parts of air

      are condensed into one part of water let us consider the matter in

      another way when one of the other elements is fastened upon by fire and

      is cut by the sharpness of its angles and sides it coalesces with the

      fire and then ceases to be cut by them any longer for no element which

      is one and the same with itself can be changed by or change another of the

      same kind and in the same state but so long as in the process of

      transition the weaker is fighting against the stronger the dissolution

      continues again when a few small particles enclosed in many larger

      ones are in process of decomposition and extinction they only cease from

      their tendency to extinction when they consent to pass into the conquering

      nature and fire becomes air and air water but if bodies of another kind

      go and attack them ie the small particles the latter continue to be

      dissolved until being completely forced back and dispersed they make

      their escape to their own kindred or else being overcome and assimilated

      to the conquering power they remain where they are and dwell with their

      victors and from being many become one and owing to these affections

      all things are changing their place for by the motion of the receiving

      vessel the bulk of each class is distributed into its proper place but

      those things which become unlike themselves and like other things are

      hurried by the shaking into the place of the things to which they grow

      like

    


      now all unmixed and primary bodies are produced by such causes as these

      as to the subordinate species which are included in the greater kinds

      they are to be attributed to the varieties in the structure of the two

      original triangles for either structure did not originally produce the

      triangle of one size only but some larger and some smaller and there are

      as many sizes as there are species of the four elements hence when they

      are mingled with themselves and with one another there is an endless

      variety of them which those who would arrive at the probable truth of

      nature ought duly to consider

    


      unless a person comes to an understanding about the nature and conditions

      of rest and motion he will meet with many difficulties in the discussion

      which follows something has been said of this matter already and

      something more remains to be said which is that motion never exists in

      what is uniform for to conceive that anything can be moved without a

      mover is hard or indeed impossible and equally impossible to conceive

      that there can be a mover unless there be something which can be movedmotion

      cannot exist where either of these are wanting and for these to be

      uniform is impossible wherefore we must assign rest to uniformity and

      motion to the want of uniformity now inequality is the cause of the

      nature which is wanting in uniformity and of this we have already

      described the origin but there still remains the further pointwhy

      things when divided after their kinds do not cease to pass through one

      another and to change their placewhich we will now proceed to

      explain in the revolution of the universe are comprehended all the four

      elements and this being circular and having a tendency to come together

      compresses everything and will not allow any place to be left void

      wherefore also fire above all things penetrates everywhere and air

      next as being next in rarity of the elements and the two other elements

      in like manner penetrate according to their degrees of rarity for those

      things which are composed of the largest particles have the largest void

      left in their compositions and those which are composed of the smallest

      particles have the least and the contraction caused by the compression

      thrusts the smaller particles into the interstices of the larger and

      thus when the small parts are placed side by side with the larger and

      the lesser divide the greater and the greater unite the lesser all the

      elements are borne up and down and hither and thither towards their own

      places for the change in the size of each changes its position in space

      and these causes generate an inequality which is always maintained and is

      continually creating a perpetual motion of the elements in all time

    


      in the next place we have to consider that there are divers kinds of fire

      there are for example first flame and secondly those emanations of

      flame which do not burn but only give light to the eyes thirdly the

      remains of fire which are seen in redhot embers after the flame has been

      extinguished there are similar differences in the air of which the

      brightest part is called the aether and the most turbid sort mist and

      darkness and there are various other nameless kinds which arise from the

      inequality of the triangles water again admits in the first place of a

      division into two kinds the one liquid and the other fusile the liquid

      kind is composed of the small and unequal particles of water and moves

      itself and is moved by other bodies owing to the want of uniformity and

      the shape of its particles whereas the fusile kind being formed of large

      and uniform particles is more stable than the other and is heavy and

      compact by reason of its uniformity but when fire gets in and dissolves

      the particles and destroys the uniformity it has greater mobility and

      becoming fluid is thrust forth by the neighbouring air and spreads upon

      the earth and this dissolution of the solid masses is called melting and

      their spreading out upon the earth flowing again when the fire goes out

      of the fusile substance it does not pass into a vacuum but into the

      neighbouring air and the air which is displaced forces together the

      liquid and still moveable mass into the place which was occupied by the

      fire and unites it with itself thus compressed the mass resumes its

      equability and is again at unity with itself because the fire which was

      the author of the inequality has retreated and this departure of the fire

      is called cooling and the coming together which follows upon it is termed

      congealment of all the kinds termed fusile that which is the densest and

      is formed out of the finest and most uniform parts is that most precious

      possession called gold which is hardened by filtration through rock this

      is unique in kind and has both a glittering and a yellow colour a shoot

      of gold which is so dense as to be very hard and takes a black colour

      is termed adamant there is also another kind which has parts nearly like

      gold and of which there are several species it is denser than gold and

      it contains a small and fine portion of earth and is therefore harder

      yet also lighter because of the great interstices which it has within

      itself and this substance which is one of the bright and denser kinds of

      water when solidified is called copper there is an alloy of earth

      mingled with it which when the two parts grow old and are disunited

      shows itself separately and is called rust the remaining phenomena of the

      same kind there will be no difficulty in reasoning out by the method of

      probabilities a man may sometimes set aside meditations about eternal

      things and for recreation turn to consider the truths of generation which

      are probable only he will thus gain a pleasure not to be repented of and

      secure for himself while he lives a wise and moderate pastime let us

      grant ourselves this indulgence and go through the probabilities relating

      to the same subjects which follow next in order

    


      water which is mingled with fire so much as is fine and liquid being so

      called by reason of its motion and the way in which it rolls along the

      ground and soft because its bases give way and are less stable than

      those of earth when separated from fire and air and isolated becomes

      more uniform and by their retirement is compressed into itself and if

      the condensation be very great the water above the earth becomes hail

      but on the earth ice and that which is congealed in a less degree and is

      only half solid when above the earth is called snow and when upon the

      earth and condensed from dew hoarfrost then again there are the

      numerous kinds of water which have been mingled with one another and are

      distilled through plants which grow in the earth and this whole class is

      called by the name of juices or saps the unequal admixture of these

      fluids creates a variety of species most of them are nameless but four

      which are of a fiery nature are clearly distinguished and have names

      first there is wine which warms the soul as well as the body secondly

      there is the oily nature which is smooth and divides the visual ray and

      for this reason is bright and shining and of a glistening appearance

      including pitch the juice of the castor berry oil itself and other

      things of a like kind thirdly there is the class of substances which

      expand the contracted parts of the mouth until they return to their

      natural state and by reason of this property create sweetnessthese

      are included under the general name of honey and lastly there is a

      frothy nature which differs from all juices having a burning quality

      which dissolves the flesh it is called opos a vegetable acid

    


      as to the kinds of earth that which is filtered through water passes into

      stone in the following mannerthe water which mixes with the earth

      and is broken up in the process changes into air and taking this form

      mounts into its own place but as there is no surrounding vacuum it

      thrusts away the neighbouring air and this being rendered heavy and

      when it is displaced having been poured around the mass of earth

      forcibly compresses it and drives it into the vacant space whence the new

      air had come up and the earth when compressed by the air into an

      indissoluble union with water becomes rock the fairer sort is that which

      is made up of equal and similar parts and is transparent that which has

      the opposite qualities is inferior but when all the watery part is

      suddenly drawn out by fire a more brittle substance is formed to which

      we give the name of pottery sometimes also moisture may remain and the

      earth which has been fused by fire becomes when cool a certain stone of

      a black colour a like separation of the water which had been copiously

      mingled with them may occur in two substances composed of finer particles

      of earth and of a briny nature out of either of them a halfsolidbody is

      then formed soluble in waterthe one soda which is used for

      purging away oil and earth the other salt which harmonizes so well in

      combinations pleasing to the palate and is as the law testifies a

      substance dear to the gods the compounds of earth and water are not

      soluble by water but by fire only and for this reasonneither

      fire nor air melt masses of earth for their particles being smaller than

      the interstices in its structure have plenty of room to move without

      forcing their way and so they leave the earth unmelted and undissolved

      but particles of water which are larger force a passage and dissolve

      and melt the earth wherefore earth when not consolidated by force is

      dissolved by water only when consolidated by nothing but fire for this

      is the only body which can find an entrance the cohesion of water again

      when very strong is dissolved by fire onlywhen weaker then either

      by air or firethe former entering the interstices and the latter

      penetrating even the triangles but nothing can dissolve air when

      strongly condensed which does not reach the elements or triangles or if

      not strongly condensed then only fire can dissolve it as to bodies

      composed of earth and water while the water occupies the vacant

      interstices of the earth in them which are compressed by force the

      particles of water which approach them from without finding no entrance

      flow around the entire mass and leave it undissolved but the particles of

      fire entering into the interstices of the water do to the water what

      water does to earth and fire to air the text seems to be corrupt and

      are the sole causes of the compound body of earth and water liquefying and

      becoming fluid now these bodies are of two kinds some of them such as

      glass and the fusible sort of stones have less water than they have

      earth on the other hand substances of the nature of wax and incense have

      more of water entering into their composition

    


      i have thus shown the various classes of bodies as they are diversified by

      their forms and combinations and changes into one another and now i must

      endeavour to set forth their affections and the causes of them in the

      first place the bodies which i have been describing are necessarily

      objects of sense but we have not yet considered the origin of flesh or

      what belongs to flesh or of that part of the soul which is mortal and

      these things cannot be adequately explained without also explaining the

      affections which are concerned with sensation nor the latter without the

      former and yet to explain them together is hardly possible for which

      reason we must assume first one or the other and afterwards examine the

      nature of our hypothesis in order then that the affections may follow

      regularly after the elements let us presuppose the existence of body and

      soul

    


      first let us enquire what we mean by saying that fire is hot and about

      this we may reason from the dividing or cutting power which it exercises

      on our bodies we all of us feel that fire is sharp and we may further

      consider the fineness of the sides and the sharpness of the angles and

      the smallness of the particles and the swiftness of the motionall

      this makes the action of fire violent and sharp so that it cuts whatever

      it meets and we must not forget that the original figure of fire ie

      the pyramid more than any other form has a dividing power which cuts

      our bodies into small pieces kepmatizei and thus naturally produces

      that affection which we call heat and hence the origin of the name

      thepmos kepma now the opposite of this is sufficiently manifest

      nevertheless we will not fail to describe it for the larger particles of

      moisture which surround the body entering in and driving out the lesser

      but not being able to take their places compress the moist principle in

      us and this from being unequal and disturbed is forced by them into a

      state of rest which is due to equability and compression but things

      which are contracted contrary to nature are by nature at war and force

      themselves apart and to this war and convulsion the name of shivering and

      trembling is given and the whole affection and the cause of the affection

      are both termed cold that is called hard to which our flesh yields and

      soft which yields to our flesh and things are also termed hard and soft

      relatively to one another that which yields has a small base but that

      which rests on quadrangular bases is firmly posed and belongs to the class

      which offers the greatest resistance so too does that which is the most

      compact and therefore most repellent the nature of the light and the

      heavy will be best understood when examined in connexion with our notions

      of above and below for it is quite a mistake to suppose that the universe

      is parted into two regions separate from and opposite to each other the

      one a lower to which all things tend which have any bulk and an upper to

      which things only ascend against their will for as the universe is in the

      form of a sphere all the extremities being equidistant from the centre

      are equally extremities and the centre which is equidistant from them

      is equally to be regarded as the opposite of them all such being the

      nature of the world when a person says that any of these points is above

      or below may he not be justly charged with using an improper expression

      for the centre of the world cannot be rightly called either above or

      below but is the centre and nothing else and the circumference is not

      the centre and has in no one part of itself a different relation to the

      centre from what it has in any of the opposite parts indeed when it is

      in every direction similar how can one rightly give to it names which

      imply opposition for if there were any solid body in equipoise at the

      centre of the universe there would be nothing to draw it to this extreme

      rather than to that for they are all perfectly similar and if a person

      were to go round the world in a circle he would often when standing at

      the antipodes of his former position speak of the same point as above and

      below for as i was saying just now to speak of the whole which is in

      the form of a globe as having one part above and another below is not like

      a sensible man the reason why these names are used and the circumstances

      under which they are ordinarily applied by us to the division of the

      heavens may be elucidated by the following suppositionif a person

      were to stand in that part of the universe which is the appointed place of

      fire and where there is the great mass of fire to which fiery bodies

      gatherif i say he were to ascend thither and having the power

      to do this were to abstract particles of fire and put them in scales and

      weigh them and then raising the balance were to draw the fire by force

      towards the uncongenial element of the air it would be very evident that

      he could compel the smaller mass more readily than the larger for when

      two things are simultaneously raised by one and the same power the

      smaller body must necessarily yield to the superior power with less

      reluctance than the larger and the larger body is called heavy and said

      to tend downwards and the smaller body is called light and said to tend

      upwards and we may detect ourselves who are upon the earth doing

      precisely the same thing for we often separate earthy natures and

      sometimes earth itself and draw them into the uncongenial element of air

      by force and contrary to nature both clinging to their kindred elements

      but that which is smaller yields to the impulse given by us towards the

      dissimilar element more easily than the larger and so we call the former

      light and the place towards which it is impelled we call above and the

      contrary state and place we call heavy and below respectively now the

      relations of these must necessarily vary because the principal masses of

      the different elements hold opposite positions for that which is light

      heavy below or above in one place will be found to be and become contrary

      and transverse and every way diverse in relation to that which is light

      heavy below or above in an opposite place and about all of them this has

      to be consideredthat the tendency of each towards its kindred

      element makes the body which is moved heavy and the place towards which

      the motion tends below but things which have an opposite tendency we call

      by an opposite name such are the causes which we assign to these

      phenomena as to the smooth and the rough any one who sees them can

      explain the reason of them to another for roughness is hardness mingled

      with irregularity and smoothness is produced by the joint effect of

      uniformity and density

    


      the most important of the affections which concern the whole body remains

      to be consideredthat is the cause of pleasure and pain in the

      perceptions of which i have been speaking and in all other things which

      are perceived by sense through the parts of the body and have both pains

      and pleasures attendant on them let us imagine the causes of every

      affection whether of sense or not to be of the following nature

      remembering that we have already distinguished between the nature which is

      easy and which is hard to move for this is the direction in which we must

      hunt the prey which we mean to take a body which is of a nature to be

      easily moved on receiving an impression however slight spreads abroad

      the motion in a circle the parts communicating with each other until at

      last reaching the principle of mind they announce the quality of the

      agent but a body of the opposite kind being immobile and not extending

      to the surrounding region merely receives the impression and does not

      stir any of the neighbouring parts and since the parts do not distribute

      the original impression to other parts it has no effect of motion on the

      whole animal and therefore produces no effect on the patient this is

      true of the bones and hair and other more earthy parts of the human body

      whereas what was said above relates mainly to sight and hearing because

      they have in them the greatest amount of fire and air now we must

      conceive of pleasure and pain in this way an impression produced in us

      contrary to nature and violent if sudden is painful and again the

      sudden return to nature is pleasant but a gentle and gradual return is

      imperceptible and vice versa on the other hand the impression of sense

      which is most easily produced is most readily felt but is not accompanied

      by pleasure or pain such for example are the affections of the sight

      which as we said above is a body naturally uniting with our body in the

      daytime for cuttings and burnings and other affections which happen to

      the sight do not give pain nor is there pleasure when the sight returns

      to its natural state but the sensations are clearest and strongest

      according to the manner in which the eye is affected by the object and

      itself strikes and touches it there is no violence either in the

      contraction or dilation of the eye but bodies formed of larger particles

      yield to the agent only with a struggle and then they impart their

      motions to the whole and cause pleasure and painpain when alienated

      from their natural conditions and pleasure when restored to them things

      which experience gradual withdrawings and emptyings of their nature and

      great and sudden replenishments fail to perceive the emptying but are

      sensible of the replenishment and so they occasion no pain but the

      greatest pleasure to the mortal part of the soul as is manifest in the

      case of perfumes but things which are changed all of a sudden and only

      gradually and with difficulty return to their own nature have effects in

      every way opposite to the former as is evident in the case of burnings

      and cuttings of the body

    


      thus have we discussed the general affections of the whole body and the

      names of the agents which produce them and now i will endeavour to speak

      of the affections of particular parts and the causes and agents of them

      as far as i am able in the first place let us set forth what was omitted

      when we were speaking of juices concerning the affections peculiar to the

      tongue these too like most of the other affections appear to be caused

      by certain contractions and dilations but they have besides more of

      roughness and smoothness than is found in other affections for whenever

      earthy particles enter into the small veins which are the testing

      instruments of the tongue reaching to the heart and fall upon the moist

      delicate portions of fleshwhen as they are dissolved they

      contract and dry up the little veins they are astringent if they are

      rougher but if not so rough then only harsh those of them which are of

      an abstergent nature and purge the whole surface of the tongue if they

      do it in excess and so encroach as to consume some part of the flesh

      itself like potash and soda are all termed bitter but the particles

      which are deficient in the alkaline quality and which cleanse only

      moderately are called salt and having no bitterness or roughness are

      regarded as rather agreeable than otherwise bodies which share in and are

      made smooth by the heat of the mouth and which are inflamed and again in

      turn inflame that which heats them and which are so light that they are

      carried upwards to the sensations of the head and cut all that comes in

      their way by reason of these qualities in them are all termed pungent

      but when these same particles refined by putrefaction enter into the

      narrow veins and are duly proportioned to the particles of earth and air

      which are there they set them whirling about one another and while they

      are in a whirl cause them to dash against and enter into one another and

      so form hollows surrounding the particles that enterwhich watery

      vessels of air for a film of moisture sometimes earthy sometimes pure

      is spread around the air are hollow spheres of water and those of them

      which are pure are transparent and are called bubbles while those

      composed of the earthy liquid which is in a state of general agitation

      and effervescence are said to boil or fermentof all these

      affections the cause is termed acid and there is the opposite affection

      arising from an opposite cause when the mass of entering particles

      immersed in the moisture of the mouth is congenial to the tongue and

      smooths and oils over the roughness and relaxes the parts which are

      unnaturally contracted and contracts the parts which are relaxed and

      disposes them all according to their naturethat sort of remedy of

      violent affections is pleasant and agreeable to every man and has the

      name sweet but enough of this

    


      the faculty of smell does not admit of differences of kind for all smells

      are of a halfformed nature and no element is so proportioned as to have

      any smell the veins about the nose are too narrow to admit earth and

      water and too wide to detain fire and air and for this reason no one

      ever perceives the smell of any of them but smells always proceed from

      bodies that are damp or putrefying or liquefying or evaporating and

      are perceptible only in the intermediate state when water is changing

      into air and air into water and all of them are either vapour or mist

      that which is passing out of air into water is mist and that which is

      passing from water into air is vapour and hence all smells are thinner

      than water and thicker than air the proof of this is that when there is

      any obstruction to the respiration and a man draws in his breath by

      force then no smell filters through but the air without the smell alone

      penetrates wherefore the varieties of smell have no name and they have

      not many or definite and simple kinds but they are distinguished only as

      painful and pleasant the one sort irritating and disturbing the whole

      cavity which is situated between the head and the navel the other having

      a soothing influence and restoring this same region to an agreeable and

      natural condition

    


      in considering the third kind of sense hearing we must speak of the

      causes in which it originates we may in general assume sound to be a blow

      which passes through the ears and is transmitted by means of the air the

      brain and the blood to the soul and that hearing is the vibration of

      this blow which begins in the head and ends in the region of the liver

      the sound which moves swiftly is acute and the sound which moves slowly

      is grave and that which is regular is equable and smooth and the reverse

      is harsh a great body of sound is loud and a small body of sound the

      reverse respecting the harmonies of sound i must hereafter speak

    


      there is a fourth class of sensible things having many intricate

      varieties which must now be distinguished they are called by the general

      name of colours and are a flame which emanates from every sort of body

      and has particles corresponding to the sense of sight i have spoken

      already in what has preceded of the causes which generate sight and in

      this place it will be natural and suitable to give a rational theory of

      colours

    


      of the particles coming from other bodies which fall upon the sight some

      are smaller and some are larger and some are equal to the parts of the

      sight itself those which are equal are imperceptible and we call them

      transparent the larger produce contraction the smaller dilation in the

      sight exercising a power akin to that of hot and cold bodies on the

      flesh or of astringent bodies on the tongue or of those heating bodies

      which we termed pungent white and black are similar effects of

      contraction and dilation in another sphere and for this reason have a

      different appearance wherefore we ought to term white that which dilates

      the visual ray and the opposite of this is black there is also a swifter

      motion of a different sort of fire which strikes and dilates the ray of

      sight until it reaches the eyes forcing a way through their passages and

      melting them and eliciting from them a union of fire and water which we

      call tears being itself an opposite fire which comes to them from an

      opposite directionthe inner fire flashes forth like lightning and

      the outer finds a way in and is extinguished in the moisture and all

      sorts of colours are generated by the mixture this affection is termed

      dazzling and the object which produces it is called bright and flashing

      there is another sort of fire which is intermediate and which reaches and

      mingles with the moisture of the eye without flashing and in this the

      fire mingling with the ray of the moisture produces a colour like blood

      to which we give the name of red a bright hue mingled with red and white

      gives the colour called auburn greek the law of proportion however

      according to which the several colours are formed even if a man knew he

      would be foolish in telling for he could not give any necessary reason

      nor indeed any tolerable or probable explanation of them again red when

      mingled with black and white becomes purple but it becomes umber greek

      when the colours are burnt as well as mingled and the black is more

      thoroughly mixed with them flamecolour greek is produced by a union of

      auburn and dun greek and dun by an admixture of black and white pale

      yellow greek by an admixture of white and auburn white and bright

      meeting and falling upon a full black become dark blue greek and when

      dark blue mingles with white a light blue greek colour is formed as

      flamecolour with black makes leek green greek there will be no

      difficulty in seeing how and by what mixtures the colours derived from

      these are made according to the rules of probability he however who

      should attempt to verify all this by experiment would forget the

      difference of the human and divine nature for god only has the knowledge

      and also the power which are able to combine many things into one and

      again resolve the one into many but no man either is or ever will be able

      to accomplish either the one or the other operation

    


      these are the elements thus of necessity then subsisting which the

      creator of the fairest and best of created things associated with himself

      when he made the selfsufficing and most perfect god using the necessary

      causes as his ministers in the accomplishment of his work but himself

      contriving the good in all his creations wherefore we may distinguish two

      sorts of causes the one divine and the other necessary and may seek for

      the divine in all things as far as our nature admits with a view to the

      blessed life but the necessary kind only for the sake of the divine

      considering that without them and when isolated from them these higher

      things for which we look cannot be apprehended or received or in any way

      shared by us

    


      seeing then that we have now prepared for our use the various classes of

      causes which are the material out of which the remainder of our discourse

      must be woven just as wood is the material of the carpenter let us

      revert in a few words to the point at which we began and then endeavour

      to add on a suitable ending to the beginning of our tale

    


      as i said at first when all things were in disorder god created in each

      thing in relation to itself and in all things in relation to each other

      all the measures and harmonies which they could possibly receive for in

      those days nothing had any proportion except by accident nor did any of

      the things which now have names deserve to be named at allas for

      example fire water and the rest of the elements all these the creator

      first set in order and out of them he constructed the universe which was

      a single animal comprehending in itself all other animals mortal and

      immortal now of the divine he himself was the creator but the creation

      of the mortal he committed to his offspring and they imitating him

      received from him the immortal principle of the soul and around this they

      proceeded to fashion a mortal body and made it to be the vehicle of the

      soul and constructed within the body a soul of another nature which was

      mortal subject to terrible and irresistible affectionsfirst of

      all pleasure the greatest incitement to evil then pain which deters

      from good also rashness and fear two foolish counsellors anger hard to

      be appeased and hope easily led astraythese they mingled with

      irrational sense and with alldaring love according to necessary laws and

      so framed man wherefore fearing to pollute the divine any more than was

      absolutely unavoidable they gave to the mortal nature a separate

      habitation in another part of the body placing the neck between them to

      be the isthmus and boundary which they constructed between the head and

      breast to keep them apart and in the breast and in what is termed the

      thorax they encased the mortal soul and as the one part of this was

      superior and the other inferior they divided the cavity of the thorax into

      two parts as the womens and mens apartments are divided in houses and

      placed the midriff to be a wall of partition between them that part of

      the inferior soul which is endowed with courage and passion and loves

      contention they settled nearer the head midway between the midriff and

      the neck in order that it might be under the rule of reason and might

      join with it in controlling and restraining the desires when they are no

      longer willing of their own accord to obey the word of command issuing

      from the citadel

    


      the heart the knot of the veins and the fountain of the blood which races

      through all the limbs was set in the place of guard that when the might

      of passion was roused by reason making proclamation of any wrong assailing

      them from without or being perpetrated by the desires within quickly the

      whole power of feeling in the body perceiving these commands and threats

      might obey and follow through every turn and alley and thus allow the

      principle of the best to have the command in all of them but the gods

      foreknowing that the palpitation of the heart in the expectation of danger

      and the swelling and excitement of passion was caused by fire formed and

      implanted as a supporter to the heart the lung which was in the first

      place soft and bloodless and also had within hollows like the pores of a

      sponge in order that by receiving the breath and the drink it might give

      coolness and the power of respiration and alleviate the heat wherefore

      they cut the airchannels leading to the lung and placed the lung about

      the heart as a soft spring that when passion was rife within the heart

      beating against a yielding body might be cooled and suffer less and

      might thus become more ready to join with passion in the service of

      reason

    


      the part of the soul which desires meats and drinks and the other things

      of which it has need by reason of the bodily nature they placed between

      the midriff and the boundary of the navel contriving in all this region a

      sort of manger for the food of the body and there they bound it down like

      a wild animal which was chained up with man and must be nourished if man

      was to exist they appointed this lower creation his place here in order

      that he might be always feeding at the manger and have his dwelling as

      far as might be from the councilchamber making as little noise and

      disturbance as possible and permitting the best part to advise quietly

      for the good of the whole and knowing that this lower principle in man

      would not comprehend reason and even if attaining to some degree of

      perception would never naturally care for rational notions but that it

      would be led away by phantoms and visions night and dayto be a

      remedy for this god combined with it the liver and placed it in the

      house of the lower nature contriving that it should be solid and smooth

      and bright and sweet and should also have a bitter quality in order that

      the power of thought which proceeds from the mind might be reflected as

      in a mirror which receives likenesses of objects and gives back images of

      them to the sight and so might strike terror into the desires when

      making use of the bitter part of the liver to which it is akin it comes

      threatening and invading and diffusing this bitter element swiftly

      through the whole liver produces colours like bile and contracting every

      part makes it wrinkled and rough and twisting out of its right place and

      contorting the lobe and closing and shutting up the vessels and gates

      causes pain and loathing and the converse happens when some gentle

      inspiration of the understanding pictures images of an opposite character

      and allays the bile and bitterness by refusing to stir or touch the nature

      opposed to itself but by making use of the natural sweetness of the

      liver corrects all things and makes them to be right and smooth and free

      and renders the portion of the soul which resides about the liver happy

      and joyful enabling it to pass the night in peace and to practise

      divination in sleep inasmuch as it has no share in mind and reason for

      the authors of our being remembering the command of their father when he

      bade them create the human race as good as they could that they might

      correct our inferior parts and make them to attain a measure of truth

      placed in the liver the seat of divination and herein is a proof that god

      has given the art of divination not to the wisdom but to the foolishness

      of man no man when in his wits attains prophetic truth and inspiration

      but when he receives the inspired word either his intelligence is

      enthralled in sleep or he is demented by some distemper or possession

      and he who would understand what he remembers to have been said whether

      in a dream or when he was awake by the prophetic and inspired nature or

      would determine by reason the meaning of the apparitions which he has

      seen and what indications they afford to this man or that of past

      present or future good and evil must first recover his wits but while

      he continues demented he cannot judge of the visions which he sees or the

      words which he utters the ancient saying is very true that only a man

      who has his wits can act or judge about himself and his own affairs and

      for this reason it is customary to appoint interpreters to be judges of

      the true inspiration some persons call them prophets they are quite

      unaware that they are only the expositors of dark sayings and visions and

      are not to be called prophets at all but only interpreters of prophecy

    


      such is the nature of the liver which is placed as we have described in

      order that it may give prophetic intimations during the life of each

      individual these intimations are plainer but after his death the liver

      becomes blind and delivers oracles too obscure to be intelligible the

      neighbouring organ the spleen is situated on the lefthand side and is

      constructed with a view of keeping the liver bright and purelike a

      napkin always ready prepared and at hand to clean the mirror and hence

      when any impurities arise in the region of the liver by reason of

      disorders of the body the loose nature of the spleen which is composed

      of a hollow and bloodless tissue receives them all and clears them away

      and when filled with the unclean matter swells and festers but again

      when the body is purged settles down into the same place as before and

      is humbled

    


      concerning the soul as to which part is mortal and which divine and how

      and why they are separated and where located if god acknowledges that we

      have spoken the truth then and then only can we be confident still we

      may venture to assert that what has been said by us is probable and will

      be rendered more probable by investigation let us assume thus much

    


      the creation of the rest of the body follows next in order and this we

      may investigate in a similar manner and it appears to be very meet that

      the body should be framed on the following principles

    


      the authors of our race were aware that we should be intemperate in eating

      and drinking and take a good deal more than was necessary or proper by

      reason of gluttony in order then that disease might not quickly destroy

      us and lest our mortal race should perish without fulfilling its endintending

      to provide against this the gods made what is called the lower belly to

      be a receptacle for the superfluous meat and drink and formed the

      convolution of the bowels so that the food might be prevented from

      passing quickly through and compelling the body to require more food thus

      producing insatiable gluttony and making the whole race an enemy to

      philosophy and music and rebellious against the divinest element within

      us

    


      the bones and flesh and other similar parts of us were made as follows

      the first principle of all of them was the generation of the marrow for

      the bonds of life which unite the soul with the body are made fast there

      and they are the root and foundation of the human race the marrow itself

      is created out of other materials god took such of the primary triangles

      as were straight and smooth and were adapted by their perfection to

      produce fire and water and air and earththese i say he separated

      from their kinds and mingling them in due proportions with one another

      made the marrow out of them to be a universal seed of the whole race of

      mankind and in this seed he then planted and enclosed the souls and in

      the original distribution gave to the marrow as many and various forms as

      the different kinds of souls were hereafter to receive that which like a

      field was to receive the divine seed he made round every way and called

      that portion of the marrow brain intending that when an animal was

      perfected the vessel containing this substance should be the head but

      that which was intended to contain the remaining and mortal part of the

      soul he distributed into figures at once round and elongated and he

      called them all by the name marrow and to these as to anchors

      fastening the bonds of the whole soul he proceeded to fashion around them

      the entire framework of our body constructing for the marrow first of

      all a complete covering of bone

    


      bone was composed by him in the following manner having sifted pure and

      smooth earth he kneaded it and wetted it with marrow and after that he

      put it into fire and then into water and once more into fire and again

      into waterin this way by frequent transfers from one to the other

      he made it insoluble by either out of this he fashioned as in a lathe a

      globe made of bone which he placed around the brain and in this he left

      a narrow opening and around the marrow of the neck and back he formed

      vertebrae which he placed under one another like pivots beginning at the

      head and extending through the whole of the trunk thus wishing to

      preserve the entire seed he enclosed it in a stonelike casing inserting

      joints and using in the formation of them the power of the other or

      diverse as an intermediate nature that they might have motion and

      flexure then again considering that the bone would be too brittle and

      inflexible and when heated and again cooled would soon mortify and

      destroy the seed withinhaving this in view he contrived the sinews

      and the flesh that so binding all the members together by the sinews

      which admitted of being stretched and relaxed about the vertebrae he

      might thus make the body capable of flexion and extension while the flesh

      would serve as a protection against the summer heat and against the winter

      cold and also against falls softly and easily yielding to external

      bodies like articles made of felt and containing in itself a warm

      moisture which in summer exudes and makes the surface damp would impart a

      natural coolness to the whole body and again in winter by the help of

      this internal warmth would form a very tolerable defence against the frost

      which surrounds it and attacks it from without he who modelled us

      considering these things mixed earth with fire and water and blended

      them and making a ferment of acid and salt he mingled it with them and

      formed soft and succulent flesh as for the sinews he made them of a

      mixture of bone and unfermented flesh attempered so as to be in a mean

      and gave them a yellow colour wherefore the sinews have a firmer and more

      glutinous nature than flesh but a softer and moister nature than the

      bones with these god covered the bones and marrow binding them together

      by sinews and then enshrouded them all in an upper covering of flesh the

      more living and sensitive of the bones he enclosed in the thinnest film of

      flesh and those which had the least life within them in the thickest and

      most solid flesh so again on the joints of the bones where reason

      indicated that no more was required he placed only a thin covering of

      flesh that it might not interfere with the flexion of our bodies and make

      them unwieldy because difficult to move and also that it might not by

      being crowded and pressed and matted together destroy sensation by reason

      of its hardness and impair the memory and dull the edge of intelligence

      wherefore also the thighs and the shanks and the hips and the bones of

      the arms and the forearms and other parts which have no joints and the

      inner bones which on account of the rarity of the soul in the marrow are

      destitute of reasonall these are abundantly provided with flesh

      but such as have mind in them are in general less fleshy except where the

      creator has made some part solely of flesh in order to give sensationas

      for example the tongue but commonly this is not the case for the nature

      which comes into being and grows up in us by a law of necessity does not

      admit of the combination of solid bone and much flesh with acute

      perceptions more than any other part the framework of the head would have

      had them if they could have coexisted and the human race having a

      strong and fleshy and sinewy head would have had a life twice or many

      times as long as it now has and also more healthy and free from pain but

      our creators considering whether they should make a longerlived race

      which was worse or a shorterlived race which was better came to the

      conclusion that every one ought to prefer a shorter span of life which

      was better to a longer one which was worse and therefore they covered

      the head with thin bone but not with flesh and sinews since it had no

      joints and thus the head was added having more wisdom and sensation than

      the rest of the body but also being in every man far weaker for these

      reasons and after this manner god placed the sinews at the extremity of

      the head in a circle round the neck and glued them together by the

      principle of likeness and fastened the extremities of the jawbones to them

      below the face and the other sinews he dispersed throughout the body

      fastening limb to limb the framers of us framed the mouth as now

      arranged having teeth and tongue and lips with a view to the necessary

      and the good contriving the way in for necessary purposes the way out for

      the best purposes for that is necessary which enters in and gives food to

      the body but the river of speech which flows out of a man and ministers

      to the intelligence is the fairest and noblest of all streams still the

      head could neither be left a bare frame of bones on account of the

      extremes of heat and cold in the different seasons nor yet be allowed to

      be wholly covered and so become dull and senseless by reason of an

      overgrowth of flesh the fleshy nature was not therefore wholly dried up

      but a large sort of peel was parted off and remained over which is now

      called the skin this met and grew by the help of the cerebral moisture

      and became the circular envelopment of the head and the moisture rising

      up under the sutures watered and closed in the skin upon the crown

      forming a sort of knot the diversity of the sutures was caused by the

      power of the courses of the soul and of the food and the more these

      struggled against one another the more numerous they became and fewer if

      the struggle were less violent this skin the divine power pierced all

      round with fire and out of the punctures which were thus made the

      moisture issued forth and the liquid and heat which was pure came away

      and a mixed part which was composed of the same material as the skin and

      had a fineness equal to the punctures was borne up by its own impulse and

      extended far outside the head but being too slow to escape was thrust

      back by the external air and rolled up underneath the skin where it took

      root thus the hair sprang up in the skin being akin to it because it is

      like threads of leather but rendered harder and closer through the

      pressure of the cold by which each hair while in process of separation

      from the skin is compressed and cooled wherefore the creator formed the

      head hairy making use of the causes which i have mentioned and

      reflecting also that instead of flesh the brain needed the hair to be a

      light covering or guard which would give shade in summer and shelter in

      winter and at the same time would not impede our quickness of perception

      from the combination of sinew skin and bone in the structure of the

      finger there arises a triple compound which when dried up takes the

      form of one hard skin partaking of all three natures and was fabricated

      by these second causes but designed by mind which is the principal cause

      with an eye to the future for our creators well knew that women and other

      animals would some day be framed out of men and they further knew that

      many animals would require the use of nails for many purposes wherefore

      they fashioned in men at their first creation the rudiments of nails for

      this purpose and for these reasons they caused skin hair and nails to

      grow at the extremities of the limbs

    


      and now that all the parts and members of the mortal animal had come

      together since its life of necessity consisted of fire and breath and it

      therefore wasted away by dissolution and depletion the gods contrived the

      following remedy they mingled a nature akin to that of man with other

      forms and perceptions and thus created another kind of animal these are

      the trees and plants and seeds which have been improved by cultivation and

      are now domesticated among us anciently there were only the wild kinds

      which are older than the cultivated for everything that partakes of life

      may be truly called a living being and the animal of which we are now

      speaking partakes of the third kind of soul which is said to be seated

      between the midriff and the navel having no part in opinion or reason or

      mind but only in feelings of pleasure and pain and the desires which

      accompany them for this nature is always in a passive state revolving in

      and about itself repelling the motion from without and using its own and

      accordingly is not endowed by nature with the power of observing or

      reflecting on its own concerns wherefore it lives and does not differ

      from a living being but is fixed and rooted in the same spot having no

      power of selfmotion

    


      now after the superior powers had created all these natures to be food for

      us who are of the inferior nature they cut various channels through the

      body as through a garden that it might be watered as from a running

      stream in the first place they cut two hidden channels or veins down the

      back where the skin and the flesh join which answered severally to the

      right and left side of the body these they let down along the backbone

      so as to have the marrow of generation between them where it was most

      likely to flourish and in order that the stream coming down from above

      might flow freely to the other parts and equalize the irrigation in the

      next place they divided the veins about the head and interlacing them

      they sent them in opposite directions those coming from the right side

      they sent to the left of the body and those from the left they diverted

      towards the right so that they and the skin might together form a bond

      which should fasten the head to the body since the crown of the head was

      not encircled by sinews and also in order that the sensations from both

      sides might be distributed over the whole body and next they ordered the

      watercourses of the body in a manner which i will describe and which

      will be more easily understood if we begin by admitting that all things

      which have lesser parts retain the greater but the greater cannot retain

      the lesser now of all natures fire has the smallest parts and therefore

      penetrates through earth and water and air and their compounds nor can

      anything hold it and a similar principle applies to the human belly for

      when meats and drinks enter it it holds them but it cannot hold air and

      fire because the particles of which they consist are smaller than its own

      structure

    


      these elements therefore god employed for the sake of distributing

      moisture from the belly into the veins weaving together a network of fire

      and air like a weel having at the entrance two lesser weels further he

      constructed one of these with two openings and from the lesser weels he

      extended cords reaching all round to the extremities of the network all

      the interior of the net he made of fire but the lesser weels and their

      cavity of air the network he took and spread over the newlyformed

      animal in the following mannerhe let the lesser weels pass into

      the mouth there were two of them and one he let down by the airpipes

      into the lungs the other by the side of the airpipes into the belly the

      former he divided into two branches both of which he made to meet at the

      channels of the nose so that when the way through the mouth did not act

      the streams of the mouth as well were replenished through the nose with

      the other cavity ie of the greater weel he enveloped the hollow parts

      of the body and at one time he made all this to flow into the lesser

      weels quite gently for they are composed of air and at another time he

      caused the lesser weels to flow back again and the net he made to find a

      way in and out through the pores of the body and the rays of fire which

      are bound fast within followed the passage of the air either way never at

      any time ceasing so long as the mortal being holds together this process

      as we affirm the namegiver named inspiration and expiration and all

      this movement active as well as passive takes place in order that the

      body being watered and cooled may receive nourishment and life for when

      the respiration is going in and out and the fire which is fast bound

      within follows it and ever and anon moving to and fro enters through

      the belly and reaches the meat and drink it dissolves them and dividing

      them into small portions and guiding them through the passages where it

      goes pumps them as from a fountain into the channels of the veins and

      makes the stream of the veins flow through the body as through a conduit

    


      let us once more consider the phenomena of respiration and enquire into

      the causes which have made it what it is they are as followsseeing

      that there is no such thing as a vacuum into which any of those things

      which are moved can enter and the breath is carried from us into the

      external air the next point is as will be clear to every one that it

      does not go into a vacant space but pushes its neighbour out of its

      place and that which is thrust out in turn drives out its neighbour and

      in this way everything of necessity at last comes round to that place from

      whence the breath came forth and enters in there and following the

      breath fills up the vacant space and this goes on like the rotation of a

      wheel because there can be no such thing as a vacuum wherefore also the

      breast and the lungs when they emit the breath are replenished by the

      air which surrounds the body and which enters in through the pores of the

      flesh and is driven round in a circle and again the air which is sent

      away and passes out through the body forces the breath inwards through the

      passage of the mouth and the nostrils now the origin of this movement may

      be supposed to be as follows in the interior of every animal the hottest

      part is that which is around the blood and veins it is in a manner an

      internal fountain of fire which we compare to the network of a creel

      being woven all of fire and extended through the centre of the body while

      the outer parts are composed of air now we must admit that heat naturally

      proceeds outward to its own place and to its kindred element and as there

      are two exits for the heat the one out through the body and the other

      through the mouth and nostrils when it moves towards the one it drives

      round the air at the other and that which is driven round falls into the

      fire and becomes warm and that which goes forth is cooled but when the

      heat changes its place and the particles at the other exit grow warmer

      the hotter air inclining in that direction and carried towards its native

      element fire pushes round the air at the other and this being affected

      in the same way and communicating the same impulse a circular motion

      swaying to and fro is produced by the double process which we call

      inspiration and expiration

    


      the phenomena of medical cuppingglasses and of the swallowing of drink

      and of the projection of bodies whether discharged in the air or bowled

      along the ground are to be investigated on a similar principle and swift

      and slow sounds which appear to be high and low and are sometimes

      discordant on account of their inequality and then again harmonical on

      account of the equality of the motion which they excite in us for when

      the motions of the antecedent swifter sounds begin to pause and the two

      are equalized the slower sounds overtake the swifter and then propel

      them when they overtake them they do not intrude a new and discordant

      motion but introduce the beginnings of a slower which answers to the

      swifter as it dies away thus producing a single mixed expression out of

      high and low whence arises a pleasure which even the unwise feel and

      which to the wise becomes a higher sort of delight being an imitation of

      divine harmony in mortal motions moreover as to the flowing of water

      the fall of the thunderbolt and the marvels that are observed about the

      attraction of amber and the heraclean stonesin none of these cases

      is there any attraction but he who investigates rightly will find that

      such wonderful phenomena are attributable to the combination of certain

      conditionsthe nonexistence of a vacuum the fact that objects push

      one another round and that they change places passing severally into

      their proper positions as they are divided or combined

    


      such as we have seen is the nature and such are the causes of

      respirationthe subject in which this discussion originated for

      the fire cuts the food and following the breath surges up within fire and

      breath rising together and filling the veins by drawing up out of the

      belly and pouring into them the cut portions of the food and so the

      streams of food are kept flowing through the whole body in all animals

      and fresh cuttings from kindred substances whether the fruits of the

      earth or herb of the field which god planted to be our daily food

      acquire all sorts of colours by their intermixture but red is the most

      pervading of them being created by the cutting action of fire and by the

      impression which it makes on a moist substance and hence the liquid which

      circulates in the body has a colour such as we have described the liquid

      itself we call blood which nourishes the flesh and the whole body whence

      all parts are watered and empty places filled

    


      now the process of repletion and evacuation is effected after the manner

      of the universal motion by which all kindred substances are drawn towards

      one another for the external elements which surround us are always

      causing us to consume away and distributing and sending off like to like

      the particles of blood too which are divided and contained within the

      frame of the animal as in a sort of heaven are compelled to imitate the

      motion of the universe each therefore of the divided parts within us

      being carried to its kindred nature replenishes the void when more is

      taken away than flows in then we decay and when less we grow and

      increase

    


      the frame of the entire creature when young has the triangles of each kind

      new and may be compared to the keel of a vessel which is just off the

      stocks they are locked firmly together and yet the whole mass is soft and

      delicate being freshly formed of marrow and nurtured on milk now when

      the triangles out of which meats and drinks are composed come in from

      without and are comprehended in the body being older and weaker than the

      triangles already there the frame of the body gets the better of them and

      its newer triangles cut them up and so the animal grows great being

      nourished by a multitude of similar particles but when the roots of the

      triangles are loosened by having undergone many conflicts with many things

      in the course of time they are no longer able to cut or assimilate the

      food which enters but are themselves easily divided by the bodies which

      come in from without in this way every animal is overcome and decays and

      this affection is called old age and at last when the bonds by which the

      triangles of the marrow are united no longer hold and are parted by the

      strain of existence they in turn loosen the bonds of the soul and she

      obtaining a natural release flies away with joy for that which takes

      place according to nature is pleasant but that which is contrary to

      nature is painful and thus death if caused by disease or produced by

      wounds is painful and violent but that sort of death which comes with

      old age and fulfils the debt of nature is the easiest of deaths and is

      accompanied with pleasure rather than with pain

    


      now every one can see whence diseases arise there are four natures out of

      which the body is compacted earth and fire and water and air and the

      unnatural excess or defect of these or the change of any of them from its

      own natural place into another orsince there are more kinds than

      one of fire and of the other elementsthe assumption by any of these

      of a wrong kind or any similar irregularity produces disorders and

      diseases for when any of them is produced or changed in a manner contrary

      to nature the parts which were previously cool grow warm and those which

      were dry become moist and the light become heavy and the heavy light

      all sorts of changes occur for as we affirm a thing can only remain the

      same with itself whole and sound when the same is added to it or

      subtracted from it in the same respect and in the same manner and in due

      proportion and whatever comes or goes away in violation of these laws

      causes all manner of changes and infinite diseases and corruptions now

      there is a second class of structures which are also natural and this

      affords a second opportunity of observing diseases to him who would

      understand them for whereas marrow and bone and flesh and sinews are

      composed of the four elements and the blood though after another manner

      is likewise formed out of them most diseases originate in the way which i

      have described but the worst of all owe their severity to the fact that

      the generation of these substances proceeds in a wrong order they are

      then destroyed for the natural order is that the flesh and sinews should

      be made of blood the sinews out of the fibres to which they are akin and

      the flesh out of the clots which are formed when the fibres are separated

      and the glutinous and rich matter which comes away from the sinews and the

      flesh not only glues the flesh to the bones but nourishes and imparts

      growth to the bone which surrounds the marrow and by reason of the

      solidity of the bones that which filters through consists of the purest

      and smoothest and oiliest sort of triangles dropping like dew from the

      bones and watering the marrow now when each process takes place in this

      order health commonly results when in the opposite order disease for

      when the flesh becomes decomposed and sends back the wasting substance

      into the veins then an oversupply of blood of diverse kinds mingling

      with air in the veins having variegated colours and bitter properties as

      well as acid and saline qualities contains all sorts of bile and serum

      and phlegm for all things go the wrong way and having become corrupted

      first they taint the blood itself and then ceasing to give nourishment to

      the body they are carried along the veins in all directions no longer

      preserving the order of their natural courses but at war with themselves

      because they receive no good from one another and are hostile to the

      abiding constitution of the body which they corrupt and dissolve the

      oldest part of the flesh which is corrupted being hard to decompose from

      long burning grows black and from being everywhere corroded becomes

      bitter and is injurious to every part of the body which is still

      uncorrupted sometimes when the bitter element is refined away the black

      part assumes an acidity which takes the place of the bitterness at other

      times the bitterness being tinged with blood has a redder colour and

      this when mixed with black takes the hue of grass and again an auburn

      colour mingles with the bitter matter when new flesh is decomposed by the

      fire which surrounds the internal flameto all which symptoms some

      physician perhaps or rather some philosopher who had the power of seeing

      in many dissimilar things one nature deserving of a name has assigned the

      common name of bile but the other kinds of bile are variously

      distinguished by their colours as for serum that sort which is the

      watery part of blood is innocent but that which is a secretion of black

      and acid bile is malignant when mingled by the power of heat with any salt

      substance and is then called acid phlegm again the substance which is

      formed by the liquefaction of new and tender flesh when air is present if

      inflated and encased in liquid so as to form bubbles which separately are

      invisible owing to their small size but when collected are of a bulk

      which is visible and have a white colour arising out of the generation of

      foamall this decomposition of tender flesh when intermingled with

      air is termed by us white phlegm and the whey or sediment of newlyformed

      phlegm is sweat and tears and includes the various daily discharges by

      which the body is purified now all these become causes of disease when

      the blood is not replenished in a natural manner by food and drink but

      gains bulk from opposite sources in violation of the laws of nature when

      the several parts of the flesh are separated by disease if the foundation

      remains the power of the disorder is only half as great and there is

      still a prospect of an easy recovery but when that which binds the flesh

      to the bones is diseased and no longer being separated from the muscles

      and sinews ceases to give nourishment to the bone and to unite flesh and

      bone and from being oily and smooth and glutinous becomes rough and salt

      and dry owing to bad regimen then all the substance thus corrupted

      crumbles away under the flesh and the sinews and separates from the bone

      and the fleshy parts fall away from their foundation and leave the sinews

      bare and full of brine and the flesh again gets into the circulation of

      the blood and makes the previouslymentioned disorders still greater and

      if these bodily affections be severe still worse are the prior disorders

      as when the bone itself by reason of the density of the flesh does not

      obtain sufficient air but becomes mouldy and hot and gangrened and

      receives no nutriment and the natural process is inverted and the bone

      crumbling passes into the food and the food into the flesh and the flesh

      again falling into the blood makes all maladies that may occur more

      virulent than those already mentioned but the worst case of all is when

      the marrow is diseased either from excess or defect and this is the

      cause of the very greatest and most fatal disorders in which the whole

      course of the body is reversed

    


      there is a third class of diseases which may be conceived of as arising in

      three ways for they are produced sometimes by wind and sometimes by

      phlegm and sometimes by bile when the lung which is the dispenser of

      the air to the body is obstructed by rheums and its passages are not

      free some of them not acting while through others too much air enters

      then the parts which are unrefreshed by air corrode while in other parts

      the excess of air forcing its way through the veins distorts them and

      decomposing the body is enclosed in the midst of it and occupies the

      midriff thus numberless painful diseases are produced accompanied by

      copious sweats and oftentimes when the flesh is dissolved in the body

      wind generated within and unable to escape is the source of quite as

      much pain as the air coming in from without but the greatest pain is felt

      when the wind gets about the sinews and the veins of the shoulders and

      swells them up and so twists back the great tendons and the sinews which

      are connected with them these disorders are called tetanus and

      opisthotonus by reason of the tension which accompanies them the cure of

      them is difficult relief is in most cases given by fever supervening the

      white phlegm though dangerous when detained within by reason of the

      airbubbles yet if it can communicate with the outside air is less

      severe and only discolours the body generating leprous eruptions and

      similar diseases when it is mingled with black bile and dispersed about

      the courses of the head which are the divinest part of us the attack if

      coming on in sleep is not so severe but when assailing those who are

      awake it is hard to be got rid of and being an affection of a sacred

      part is most justly called sacred an acid and salt phlegm again is the

      source of all those diseases which take the form of catarrh but they have

      many names because the places into which they flow are manifold

    


      inflammations of the body come from burnings and inflamings and all of

      them originate in bile when bile finds a means of discharge it boils up

      and sends forth all sorts of tumours but when imprisoned within it

      generates many inflammatory diseases above all when mingled with pure

      blood since it then displaces the fibres which are scattered about in the

      blood and are designed to maintain the balance of rare and dense in order

      that the blood may not be so liquefied by heat as to exude from the pores

      of the body nor again become too dense and thus find a difficulty in

      circulating through the veins the fibres are so constituted as to

      maintain this balance and if any one brings them all together when the

      blood is dead and in process of cooling then the blood which remains

      becomes fluid but if they are left alone they soon congeal by reason of

      the surrounding cold the fibres having this power over the blood bile

      which is only stale blood and which from being flesh is dissolved again

      into blood at the first influx coming in little by little hot and

      liquid is congealed by the power of the fibres and so congealing and

      made to cool it produces internal cold and shuddering when it enters

      with more of a flood and overcomes the fibres by its heat and boiling up

      throws them into disorder if it have power enough to maintain its

      supremacy it penetrates the marrow and burns up what may be termed the

      cables of the soul and sets her free but when there is not so much of

      it and the body though wasted still holds out the bile is itself

      mastered and is either utterly banished or is thrust through the veins

      into the lower or upper belly and is driven out of the body like an exile

      from a state in which there has been civil war whence arise diarrhoeas

      and dysenteries and all such disorders when the constitution is

      disordered by excess of fire continuous heat and fever are the result

      when excess of air is the cause then the fever is quotidian when of

      water which is a more sluggish element than either fire or air then the

      fever is a tertian when of earth which is the most sluggish of the four

      and is only purged away in a fourfold period the result is a quartan

      fever which can with difficulty be shaken off

    


      such is the manner in which diseases of the body arise the disorders of

      the soul which depend upon the body originate as follows we must

      acknowledge disease of the mind to be a want of intelligence and of this

      there are two kinds to wit madness and ignorance in whatever state a

      man experiences either of them that state may be called disease and

      excessive pains and pleasures are justly to be regarded as the greatest

      diseases to which the soul is liable for a man who is in great joy or in

      great pain in his unreasonable eagerness to attain the one and to avoid

      the other is not able to see or to hear anything rightly but he is mad

      and is at the time utterly incapable of any participation in reason he

      who has the seed about the spinal marrow too plentiful and overflowing

      like a tree overladen with fruit has many throes and also obtains many

      pleasures in his desires and their offspring and is for the most part of

      his life deranged because his pleasures and pains are so very great his

      soul is rendered foolish and disordered by his body yet he is regarded

      not as one diseased but as one who is voluntarily bad which is a

      mistake the truth is that the intemperance of love is a disease of the

      soul due chiefly to the moisture and fluidity which is produced in one of

      the elements by the loose consistency of the bones and in general all

      that which is termed the incontinence of pleasure and is deemed a reproach

      under the idea that the wicked voluntarily do wrong is not justly a matter

      for reproach for no man is voluntarily bad but the bad become bad by

      reason of an ill disposition of the body and bad education things which

      are hateful to every man and happen to him against his will and in the

      case of pain too in like manner the soul suffers much evil from the body

      for where the acid and briny phlegm and other bitter and bilious humours

      wander about in the body and find no exit or escape but are pent up

      within and mingle their own vapours with the motions of the soul and are

      blended with them they produce all sorts of diseases more or fewer and

      in every degree of intensity and being carried to the three places of the

      soul whichever they may severally assail they create infinite varieties

      of illtemper and melancholy of rashness and cowardice and also of

      forgetfulness and stupidity further when to this evil constitution of

      body evil forms of government are added and evil discourses are uttered in

      private as well as in public and no sort of instruction is given in youth

      to cure these evils then all of us who are bad become bad from two causes

      which are entirely beyond our control in such cases the planters are to

      blame rather than the plants the educators rather than the educated but

      however that may be we should endeavour as far as we can by education

      and studies and learning to avoid vice and attain virtue this however

      is part of another subject

    


      there is a corresponding enquiry concerning the mode of treatment by which

      the mind and the body are to be preserved about which it is meet and

      right that i should say a word in turn for it is more our duty to speak

      of the good than of the evil everything that is good is fair and the

      fair is not without proportion and the animal which is to be fair must

      have due proportion now we perceive lesser symmetries or proportions and

      reason about them but of the highest and greatest we take no heed for

      there is no proportion or disproportion more productive of health and

      disease and virtue and vice than that between soul and body this

      however we do not perceive nor do we reflect that when a weak or small

      frame is the vehicle of a great and mighty soul or conversely when a

      little soul is encased in a large body then the whole animal is not fair

      for it lacks the most important of all symmetries but the due proportion

      of mind and body is the fairest and loveliest of all sights to him who has

      the seeing eye just as a body which has a leg too long or which is

      unsymmetrical in some other respect is an unpleasant sight and also

      when doing its share of work is much distressed and makes convulsive

      efforts and often stumbles through awkwardness and is the cause of

      infinite evil to its own selfin like manner we should conceive of

      the double nature which we call the living being and when in this

      compound there is an impassioned soul more powerful than the body that

      soul i say convulses and fills with disorders the whole inner nature of

      man and when eager in the pursuit of some sort of learning or study

      causes wasting or again when teaching or disputing in private or in

      public and strifes and controversies arise inflames and dissolves the

      composite frame of man and introduces rheums and the nature of this

      phenomenon is not understood by most professors of medicine who ascribe

      it to the opposite of the real cause and once more when a body large and

      too strong for the soul is united to a small and weak intelligence then

      inasmuch as there are two desires natural to manone of food for

      the sake of the body and one of wisdom for the sake of the diviner part

      of usthen i say the motions of the stronger getting the better

      and increasing their own power but making the soul dull and stupid and

      forgetful engender ignorance which is the greatest of diseases there is

      one protection against both kinds of disproportionthat we should

      not move the body without the soul or the soul without the body and thus

      they will be on their guard against each other and be healthy and well

      balanced and therefore the mathematician or any one else whose thoughts

      are much absorbed in some intellectual pursuit must allow his body also

      to have due exercise and practise gymnastic and he who is careful to

      fashion the body should in turn impart to the soul its proper motions

      and should cultivate music and all philosophy if he would deserve to be

      called truly fair and truly good and the separate parts should be treated

      in the same manner in imitation of the pattern of the universe for as

      the body is heated and also cooled within by the elements which enter into

      it and is again dried up and moistened by external things and

      experiences these and the like affections from both kinds of motions the

      result is that the body if given up to motion when in a state of

      quiescence is overmastered and perishes but if any one in imitation of

      that which we call the fostermother and nurse of the universe will not

      allow the body ever to be inactive but is always producing motions and

      agitations through its whole extent which form the natural defence

      against other motions both internal and external and by moderate exercise

      reduces to order according to their affinities the particles and

      affections which are wandering about the body as we have already said

      when speaking of the universe he will not allow enemy placed by the side

      of enemy to stir up wars and disorders in the body but he will place

      friend by the side of friend so as to create health now of all motions

      that is the best which is produced in a thing by itself for it is most

      akin to the motion of thought and of the universe but that motion which

      is caused by others is not so good and worst of all is that which moves

      the body when at rest in parts only and by some external agency

      wherefore of all modes of purifying and reuniting the body the best is

      gymnastic the next best is a surging motion as in sailing or any other

      mode of conveyance which is not fatiguing the third sort of motion may be

      of use in a case of extreme necessity but in any other will be adopted by

      no man of sense i mean the purgative treatment of physicians for

      diseases unless they are very dangerous should not be irritated by

      medicines since every form of disease is in a manner akin to the living

      being whose complex frame has an appointed term of life for not the

      whole race only but each individualbarring inevitable accidentscomes

      into the world having a fixed span and the triangles in us are originally

      framed with power to last for a certain time beyond which no man can

      prolong his life and this holds also of the constitution of diseases if

      any one regardless of the appointed time tries to subdue them by medicine

      he only aggravates and multiplies them wherefore we ought always to

      manage them by regimen as far as a man can spare the time and not

      provoke a disagreeable enemy by medicines

    


      enough of the composite animal and of the body which is a part of him

      and of the manner in which a man may train and be trained by himself so as

      to live most according to reason and we must above and before all provide

      that the element which is to train him shall be the fairest and best

      adapted to that purpose a minute discussion of this subject would be a

      serious task but if as before i am to give only an outline the subject

      may not unfitly be summed up as follows

    


      i have often remarked that there are three kinds of soul located within

      us having each of them motions and i must now repeat in the fewest words

      possible that one part if remaining inactive and ceasing from its

      natural motion must necessarily become very weak but that which is

      trained and exercised very strong wherefore we should take care that the

      movements of the different parts of the soul should be in due proportion

    


      and we should consider that god gave the sovereign part of the human soul

      to be the divinity of each one being that part which as we say dwells

      at the top of the body and inasmuch as we are a plant not of an earthly

      but of a heavenly growth raises us from earth to our kindred who are in

      heaven and in this we say truly for the divine power suspended the head

      and root of us from that place where the generation of the soul first

      began and thus made the whole body upright when a man is always occupied

      with the cravings of desire and ambition and is eagerly striving to

      satisfy them all his thoughts must be mortal and as far as it is

      possible altogether to become such he must be mortal every whit because

      he has cherished his mortal part but he who has been earnest in the love

      of knowledge and of true wisdom and has exercised his intellect more than

      any other part of him must have thoughts immortal and divine if he

      attain truth and in so far as human nature is capable of sharing in

      immortality he must altogether be immortal and since he is ever

      cherishing the divine power and has the divinity within him in perfect

      order he will be perfectly happy now there is only one way of taking

      care of things and this is to give to each the food and motion which are

      natural to it and the motions which are naturally akin to the divine

      principle within us are the thoughts and revolutions of the universe

      these each man should follow and correct the courses of the head which

      were corrupted at our birth and by learning the harmonies and revolutions

      of the universe should assimilate the thinking being to the thought

      renewing his original nature and having assimilated them should attain to

      that perfect life which the gods have set before mankind both for the

      present and the future

    


      thus our original design of discoursing about the universe down to the

      creation of man is nearly completed a brief mention may be made of the

      generation of other animals so far as the subject admits of brevity in

      this manner our argument will best attain a due proportion on the subject

      of animals then the following remarks may be offered of the men who

      came into the world those who were cowards or led unrighteous lives may

      with reason be supposed to have changed into the nature of women in the

      second generation and this was the reason why at that time the gods

      created in us the desire of sexual intercourse contriving in man one

      animated substance and in woman another which they formed respectively

      in the following manner the outlet for drink by which liquids pass

      through the lung under the kidneys and into the bladder which receives

      and then by the pressure of the air emits them was so fashioned by them

      as to penetrate also into the body of the marrow which passes from the

      head along the neck and through the back and which in the preceding

      discourse we have named the seed and the seed having life and becoming

      endowed with respiration produces in that part in which it respires a

      lively desire of emission and thus creates in us the love of procreation

      wherefore also in men the organ of generation becoming rebellious and

      masterful like an animal disobedient to reason and maddened with the

      sting of lust seeks to gain absolute sway and the same is the case with

      the socalled womb or matrix of women the animal within them is desirous

      of procreating children and when remaining unfruitful long beyond its

      proper time gets discontented and angry and wandering in every direction

      through the body closes up the passages of the breath and by

      obstructing respiration drives them to extremity causing all varieties

      of disease until at length the desire and love of the man and the woman

      bringing them together and as it were plucking the fruit from the tree

      sow in the womb as in a field animals unseen by reason of their

      smallness and without form these again are separated and matured within

      they are then finally brought out into the light and thus the generation

      of animals is completed

    


      thus were created women and the female sex in general but the race of

      birds was created out of innocent lightminded men who although their

      minds were directed toward heaven imagined in their simplicity that the

      clearest demonstration of the things above was to be obtained by sight

      these were remodelled and transformed into birds and they grew feathers

      instead of hair the race of wild pedestrian animals again came from

      those who had no philosophy in any of their thoughts and never considered

      at all about the nature of the heavens because they had ceased to use the

      courses of the head but followed the guidance of those parts of the soul

      which are in the breast in consequence of these habits of theirs they had

      their frontlegs and their heads resting upon the earth to which they were

      drawn by natural affinity and the crowns of their heads were elongated

      and of all sorts of shapes into which the courses of the soul were

      crushed by reason of disuse and this was the reason why they were created

      quadrupeds and polypods god gave the more senseless of them the more

      support that they might be more attracted to the earth and the most

      foolish of them who trail their bodies entirely upon the ground and have

      no longer any need of feet he made without feet to crawl upon the earth

      the fourth class were the inhabitants of the water these were made out of

      the most entirely senseless and ignorant of all whom the transformers did

      not think any longer worthy of pure respiration because they possessed a

      soul which was made impure by all sorts of transgression and instead of

      the subtle and pure medium of air they gave them the deep and muddy sea

      to be their element of respiration and hence arose the race of fishes and

      oysters and other aquatic animals which have received the most remote

      habitations as a punishment of their outlandish ignorance these are the

      laws by which animals pass into one another now as ever changing as

      they lose or gain wisdom and folly

    


      we may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe has an

      end the world has received animals mortal and immortal and is fulfilled

      with them and has become a visible animal containing the visiblethe

      sensible god who is the image of the intellectual the greatest best

      fairest most perfectthe one onlybegotten heaven
