<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Confucius was born in the year 550 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a> in the land of Lu, in a
small village, situated in the western part of the modern province of
Shantung. His name was K'ung Ch'iu, and his style (corresponding to
our Christian name) was Chung-ni. His countrymen speak of him as K'ung
Fu-tzu, the Master, or philosopher K'ung. This expression was altered
into Confucius by the Jesuit missionaries who first carried his fame
to Europe.</p>
<p>Since the golden days of the Emperors Yao and Shun, the legendary
founders of the Chinese Empire, nearly two thousand years had passed.
Shun chose as his successor Yü, who had been his chief minister, a man
whose devotion to duty was such that when engaged in draining the
empire of the great flood—a task that took eight years to
accomplish—he never entered his home till the work was done, although
in the course of his labours he had thrice to pass his door. He
founded the Hsia dynasty, which lasted till 1766 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The last emperor
of this line, a vile tyrant, was overthrown by T'ang, who became the
first ruler of the house of Shang, or Yin. This dynasty again
degenerated in course of time and came to an end in Chou, or Chou Hsin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>(1154-22 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), a monster of lust, extravagance, and cruelty. The
empire was only held together by the strength and wisdom of the Duke
of Chou, or King Wen, to give him his popular title, one of the
greatest men in Chinese history. He controlled two-thirds of the
empire; but, believing that the people were not yet ready for a
change, he refrained from dethroning the emperor. In his day 'the
husbandman paid one in nine; the pay of the officers was hereditary;
men were questioned at barriers and at markets, but there were no
tolls; fishgarths were not preserved; the children of criminals were
sackless. The old and wifeless—the widower; the old and
husbandless—the widow; the old and childless—the lone one; the young
and fatherless—the orphan; these four are the people most in need
below heaven, and they have no one to whom to cry, so when King Wen
reigned his love went out first to them' (Mencius, Book II, chapter
5). After his death, his son, King Wu, decided that the nation was
ripe for change. He overcame Chou Hsin by force of arms, and, placing
himself on the throne, became the founder of the Chou dynasty.</p>
<p>In the time of Confucius the Chou dynasty still filled the throne. But
it had long since become effete, and all power had passed into the
hands of the great vassals. The condition of China was much like that
of Germany in the worst days of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperor was
powerless, the various vassal states were independent in all but name,
and often at war one with the other. These states again were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>disintegrated, and their rulers impotent against encroaching
feudatories. In Confucius' native state, Lu, the duke was a mere
shadow. The younger branches of his house had usurped all power. Three
in number, they were called the Three Clans. The most important of the
three was the Chi, or Chi-sun clan, whose chiefs Chi Huan and Chi
K'ang are often mentioned by Confucius. But the power of the Chi, too,
was ill-secured. The minister Yang Huo overawed his master, and once
even threw him into prison. Nor was the condition of the other states
of the empire better than that of Lu. Confucius thought it worse.</p>
<p>Into this turbulent world Confucius was born. Though his father was
only a poor military officer, he could trace his descent from the
imperial house of Yin. Confucius married at nineteen, and is known to
have had one son and one daughter. Shortly after his marriage he
entered the service of the state as keeper of the granary. A year
later he was put in charge of the public fields. In 527 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> his
mother died, and, in obedience to Chinese custom, he had to retire
from public life. When the years of mourning were over, he did not
again take office, but devoted himself instead to study and teaching.
As the years rolled by his fame grew, and a band of pupils gathered
round him. In 517 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the anarchy in Lu reached such a pitch that
Confucius moved to the neighbouring land of Ch'i. Here he had several
interviews with the reigning duke, but met with little encouragement
(<a href="#BOOK_XVIII" class="pginternal">xviii.</a> 3). So he soon returned to his native country, and resumed for
fifteen years his work as student and teacher.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>
<p>During these fifteen years the power of the duke sank lower and lower,
and the Chi was menaced by his minister Yang Huo. In times so dark,
men that loved quiet sought in the world of thought an escape from the
gloom around them, whilst others that were less resigned turned over
in their minds the causes of the realm's decay. Lao-tzu, the founder
of the mystic Taoist philosophy, taught that in inaction alone peace
can be found; Mo-tzu proclaimed the doctrine of universal love: that
we should love all men as we love self, love the parents of others as
we love our own parents. Upright men were driven or fled from the
world. Confucius often met them in his wanderings, and was reproved
for not doing as they did. But his practical mind told him that
inaction could not help the world, and that to find a remedy for the
nation's ills, their cause must first be learned. This could only be
done by historical study. He therefore devoted himself to the study of
past times, edited in later life the <i>Book of History</i>, and compiled
the work called <i>Spring and Autumn</i>, a history of his native state
from 722 to 481 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> To bring again the golden days of Yao and Shun a
return must be made to the principles of Wen and Wu, the kings that
had rebuilt the empire after tyranny and selfishness had laid it low.
Of impracticable ideals and renunciation of the world no good could
come.</p>
<p>At last in 501 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Yang Huo was forced to flee from Lu, and prospects
brightened. A year later Confucius was appointed governor of a town.
So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> great was his success as governor that before long he was promoted
to be Superintendent of Works, and then to be Chief Criminal Judge. He
won great influence with his master, and did much to lighten the
general misery. He so strengthened the power of the duke that
neighbouring states grew jealous. To sow dissension between duke and
minister the men of Ch'i sent the duke a gift of singing girls. Such
joy they gave him that for three days no court was held. On this
Confucius left the land, 497 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>
<p>For the next thirteen years Confucius wandered from land to land,
followed by his disciples, seeking in vain for a ruler that was
willing to employ him, and whom he was willing to serve. At times he
was exposed to danger, at other times to want. But as a rule he was
treated with consideration, although his teachings were ignored. Yet
thirteen years of homeless wandering, of hopes deferred and
frustrated, must have been hard to bear. When he left office Confucius
was already fifty-three years old, and his life so far seemed a
failure. The sense of his wasted powers may well have tempted him now
and again to take office under an unworthy ruler; but knowing that no
good could come of it he refrained, and probably he never seriously
thought of doing so.</p>
<p>In 483 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when Confucius was sixty-six years old, through the
influence of his disciple Jan Yu, who was in the service of the Chi,
the Master was invited to return to his native land. Here he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> remained
till his death in 479 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> He had many interviews with the reigning
duke and the head of the Chi clan, but gained no influence over either
of them. So he turned once more to his favourite studies; edited the
<i>Book of Poetry</i>—perhaps the most interesting collection of ancient
songs extant—and wrote <i>Spring and Autumn</i>. His closing years were
darkened by the loss of those dearest to him. First his son died, then
Yen Yüan, the disciple whom he loved best. At his death the Master was
overcome by grief, and he left none behind him that loved learning.
Lastly Tzu-lu, the frank and bold, was killed in battle. A little
later, in his seventy-first year, Confucius himself passed away, 479
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>
<p>This book of the Master's Sayings is believed by the Chinese to have
been written by the disciples of Confucius. But there is nothing to
prove this, and some passages in the book point the other way. Book
  <a href="#BOOK_VIII" class="pginternal">viii</a> speaks of the death of Tseng-tzu, who did not die till 437 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
forty-two years after the Master. The chief authority for the text as
it stands to-day is a manuscript found in the house of Confucius in
150 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, hidden there, in all likelihood, between the years 213 and
211 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the reigning emperor was seeking to destroy every copy
of the classics. We find no earlier reference to the book under its
present name. But Mencius (372-289 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) quotes seven passages from
it, in language all but identical with the present text, as the words
of Confucius. No man ever talked the language of these sayings. Such
pith and smoothness is only reached by a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> process of rounding and
polishing. We shall probably come no nearer to the truth than Legge's
conclusion that the book was put together by the pupils of the
disciples of Confucius, from the words and notebooks of their masters,
about the year 400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<h2><a id="THE_SAYINGS_OF_CONFUCIUS"></a>THE SAYINGS OF CONFUCIUS</h2>
<hr style="width: 65%;">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>
<h2><a id="BOOK_I"></a>BOOK I</h2>
<p>1. The Master said, To learn and then do, is not that a pleasure? When
friends come from afar do we not rejoice? To live unknown and not
fret, is not that to be a gentleman?</p>
<p>2. Yu-tzu<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a> said. Few men that are good sons and good brothers are
fond of withstanding those over them. A man that is not fond of
withstanding those over him and is yet fond of broils is nowhere
found. A gentleman heeds the roots. When the root has taken, the Way
is born. And to be a good son and a good brother, is not that the root
of love?</p>
<p>3. The Master said, Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found
with love.</p>
<p>4. Tseng-tzu<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> said, Thrice daily I ask myself: In dealing for
others, have I been unfaithful? Have I been untrue to friends? Do I
practise what I preach?</p>
<p>5. The Master said, To guide a land of a thousand chariots, honour
business and be true; spend little and love men; time thy calls on the
people.</p>
<p>6. The Master said, The young should be dutiful <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>at home, modest
abroad, careful and true, overflowing in kindness for all, but in
brotherhood with love. And if they have strength to spare they should
spend it on the arts.</p>
<p>7. Tzu-hsia<a id="FNanchor_4_1_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a> said, If a man eschews beauty and honours worth, if he
serves his father and mother with all his strength, if he is ready to
give his life for his lord, and keeps faith with his friends, though
others may say he has no learning, I must call him learned.</p>
<p>8. The Master said, A gentleman will not be looked up to unless he is
staid, nor will his learning be sound. Put faithfulness and truth
first; have no friends unlike thyself; be not ashamed to mend thy
faults.</p>
<p>9. Tseng-tzu<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a> said, Heed the dead, follow up the past, and the soul
of the people will again grow great.</p>
<p>10. Tzu-ch'in<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a> said to Tzu-kung,<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a> When he comes to a country the
Master always hears how it is governed; does he ask, or is it told
him?</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, The Master gets it by his warmth and honesty, by
politeness, modesty and yielding. The way the Master asks is unlike
other men's asking.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, Whilst thy father lives look for his purpose;
when he is gone, look how he walked. To change nothing in thy father's
ways for three years may be called pious.</p>
<p>12, Yu-tzu<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a> said, To behave with ease is the best <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>part of courtesy.
This was the beauty of the old kings' ways; this they followed in
small and great. But knowing this, it will not do to give way to ease,
unchecked by courtesy. This too is wrong.</p>
<p>13. Yu-tzu said, If pledges are close to right, word can be kept. If
attentions are close to courtesy, shame will be kept far. If we do not
choose our leaders wrong, we may worship them too.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, A gentleman that does not seek to eat his fill,
nor look for ease in his home, who is earnest at work and careful of
speech, who walks with those that keep the Way, and is guided by them,
may be said to love learning.</p>
<p>15. Tzu-kung<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a> said, Poor, but no flatterer; rich, but not proud: how
would that be?</p>
<p>It would do, said the Master; but better still were poor but merry;
rich, but loving courtesy.</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, When the poem says:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If ye cut, if ye file,<br></span>
<span class="i2">If ye polish and grind,<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>is that what is meant?</p>
<p>The Master said, Now I can begin to talk of poetry to Tz'u. Tell him
what is gone, and he knows what shall come.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Not to be known is no sorrow. My sorrow is not
knowing men.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_II"></a>BOOK II</h2>
<p>1. The Master said, He that rules by mind is like the north star,
steady in his seat, whilst the stars all bend to him.</p>
<p>2. The Master said, The three hundred poems are summed up in the one
line, Think no evil.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, Guide the people by law, aline them by punishment;
they may shun crime, but they will want shame. Guide them by mind,
aline them by courtesy; they will learn shame and grow good.</p>
<p>4. The Master said, At fifteen, I had the will to learn; at thirty, I
could stand; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I understood the
heavenly Bidding; at sixty, my ears were opened<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">[9]</a>; at seventy, I
could do as my heart lusted without trespassing from the square.</p>
<p>5. Meng Yi asked the duty of a son.</p>
<p>The Master said, Not to transgress.</p>
<p>As Fan Chi'ih<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a> was driving him, the Master said, Meng-sun<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a> asked
me the duty of a son; I answered, Not to transgress.</p>
<p>What did ye mean? said Fan Chi'ih.</p>
<p>To serve our father and mother with courtesy whilst they live; to bury
them with courtesy when they die, and to worship them with courtesy.</p>
<p>6. Meng Wu asked the duty of a son.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p><p>The Master said, He should not grieve his father and mother by
anything but illness.</p>
<p>7. Tzu-yu<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a> asked the duty of a son.</p>
<p>The Master said, He that can feed his parents is now called a good
son. But both dogs and horses are fed, and unless we honour our
parents, what is the difference?</p>
<p>8. Tzu-hsia<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">[13]</a> asked the duty of a son.</p>
<p>The Master said, Our manner is the hard part. For the young to be a
stay in toil and leave the wine and food to their elders, is this to
fulfil their duty?</p>
<p>9. The Master said, If I talk all day to Hui,<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a> like a dullard, he
never differs from me. But when he is gone, if I watch him when alone,
he can carry out what I taught. No, Hui is no dullard!</p>
<p>10. The Master said, See what he does; watch what moves him; search
what pleases him: can the man lie hidden? Can the man lie hidden?</p>
<p>11. The Master said, To keep old knowledge warm and get new makes the
teacher.</p>
<p>12. The Master said, A gentleman is not a vessel.</p>
<p>13. Tzu-kung<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a> asked, What is a gentleman?</p>
<p>The Master said, He puts words into deeds first, and follows these up
with words.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, A gentleman is broad and fair; the small man
takes sides and is narrow.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, Learning without thought is naught; thought
without learning is dangerous.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p><p>16. The Master said, To fight strange doctrines does harm.</p>
<p>17. The Master said, Yu,<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_16">[16]</a> shall I teach thee what is wisdom? To
know what we know, and know what we do not know, is wisdom.</p>
<p>18. Tsu-chang<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">[17]</a> learned with an eye to pay.</p>
<p>The Master said, Hear much, leave all that is doubtful alone, speak
warily of everything else, and few will be offended. See much, leave
all that is dangerous alone, deal warily with everything else, and
thou wilt have little to rue. If thy words seldom give offence, and
thy deeds leave little to rue, pay will follow.</p>
<p>19. Duke Ai<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">[18]</a> asked, What should I do to win the people?</p>
<p>Confucius answered, Lift up the straight, put away the crooked; and
the people will be won. Lift up the crooked, put away the straight;
and the people will not be won.</p>
<p>20. Chi K'ang<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19_19">[19]</a> asked how to make the people lowly, faithful and
painstaking.</p>
<p>The Master said, Meet them with dignity, they will be lowly; be a good
son and merciful, they will be faithful; lift up the good and teach
the unskilled, and they will take pains.</p>
<p>21. One said to Confucius, Why do ye not govern, Sir?</p>
<p>The Master said, What does the Book<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20_20">[20]</a> say of a good son? 'To be a
good son and a friend to thy <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>brothers is to show how to govern.'
This, too, is to govern. Must one be in office to govern?</p>
<p>22. The Master said, A man without truth, I know not what good he is!
A cart without a crosspole, a carriage without a yoke, how can they be
moved?</p>
<p>23. Tzu-chang<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">[21]</a> asked whether we can know what is to be ten
generations hence.</p>
<p>The Master said, The Yin<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">[22]</a> took over the manners of the Hsia; the
harm and the good that they did them can be known. The Chou took over
the manners of the Yin; the harm and the good that they did them can
be known. And we may know what shall be, even an hundred generations
hence, whoever follows Chou.</p>
<p>24. The Master said, To worship the ghosts of men not akin to us is
fawning. To see the right and not do it is want of courage.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_III"></a>BOOK III</h2>
<p>1. Of the Chi having eight rows of dancers<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">[23]</a> in his courtyard,
Confucius said, If this is to be borne, what is not to be borne?</p>
<p>2. When the sacrifice was ended, the Three Clans had the Yung hymn
sung.</p>
<p>The Master said,</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Princes and dukes assist.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Solemn is the Son of heaven;<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>what meaning has this in the courtyard of the Three Clans?</p>
<p>3. The Master said, A man without love, what is courtesy to him? A man
without love, what is music to him?</p>
<p>4. Lin Fang asked what good form is at root.</p>
<p>The Master said, A big question! At high-tides, thrift is better than
waste; at burials, grief is worth more than nicety.</p>
<p>5. The Master said, Every wild tribe has its lord, whereas the lands
of Hsia<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">[24]</a> have none!</p>
<p>6. The Chi sacrificed to Mount T'ai.<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The Master said to Jan Yu,<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_26">[26]</a> Canst thou not stop this?</p>
<p>He answered, I cannot.</p>
<p>Alas! said the Master; dost thou think Mount T'ai less wise than Lin
Fang?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p><p>7. The Master said, A gentleman never strives with others. Or must he,
perhaps, in shooting? But then, as he bows and makes way in going up
or steps down to drink,<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">[27]</a> his strife is that of a gentleman.</p>
<p>8. Tzu-hsia asked, What is the meaning of:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her cunning smiles,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her dimples light,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her lovely eyes,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So clear and bright,<br></span>
<span class="i0">All unadorned,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The background white.<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>Colouring, said the Master, is second to the plain ground.</p>
<p>Then good form is second, said Tzu-hsia.</p>
<p>Shang,<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_28">[28]</a> said the Master, thou hast hit my meaning! Now I can talk
of poetry to thee.</p>
<p>9. The Master said, I can speak of the manners of Hsia; but as proof
of them Chi<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_29">[29]</a> is not enough. I can speak of the manners of Yin; but
as proof of them Sung is not enough. This is due to their dearth of
books and great men. If there were enough of these, I could use them
as proofs.</p>
<p>10. The Master said, After the drink offering at the Great Sacrifice,
I have no wish to see more.</p>
<p>11. One asked the meaning of the Great Sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Master said, I do not know. He that knew the meaning would
overlook all below heaven as I do this—and he pointed to his palm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p><p>12. He worshipped as if those whom he worshipped were before him; he
worshipped the spirits as if they were before him.</p>
<p>The Master said: For me, to take no part in the sacrifice is the same
as not sacrificing.</p>
<p>13. Wang-sun Chia<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_30">[30]</a> said, What is the meaning of, It is better to
court the hearth-god than the god of the home?</p>
<p>Not so, said the Master. A sin against Heaven leaves no room for
prayer.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, Chou<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31_31">[31]</a> looks back on two lines of kings. How
rich, how rich it is in art! I follow Chou.</p>
<p>15. On going into the Great Temple the Master asked about everything.</p>
<p>One said, Who says that the Tsou man's son knows the rites? On going
into the Great Temple he asked about everything.</p>
<p>When he heard this, the Master said, Such is the rite.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, In shooting, the arrow need not go right through
the target, for men are not the same in strength. This was the old
rule.</p>
<p>17. Tzu-kung wished to do away with the sheep offering at the new
moon.</p>
<p>The Master said, Thou lovest the sheep, Tz'u: I love the rite.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p><p>18. The Master said: Serve the king with all courtesy, men call it
fawning.</p>
<p>19. Duke Ting asked how a lord should treat his lieges, and how lieges
should serve their lord.</p>
<p>Confucius answered, The lord should treat his lieges with courtesy;
lieges should serve their lord faithfully.</p>
<p>20. The Master said, The poem <i>The Osprey</i> is glad, but not wanton; it
is sad, but not morbid.</p>
<p>21. Duke Ai asked Tsai Wo about the earth-altars.</p>
<p>Tsai Wo answered, The Emperors of the house of Hsia grew firs round
them; the men of Yin grew cypress; the men of Chou grew chestnut,
which was to say, Let the people tremble.<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>On hearing this, the Master said, I do not speak of what is ended,
chide what is settled, or find fault with what is past.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>22. The Master said, How shallow was Kuan Chung!</p>
<p>But, said one, was not Kuan Chung thrifty?</p>
<p>The Kuan, said the Master, owned San Kuei, and no one of his household
held two posts: was that thrift?</p>
<p>At least Kuan Chung knew good form.</p>
<p>The Master said, Kings screen their gates with trees; the Kuan, too,
had trees to screen his gate. When two kings are carousing, they have
a stand for <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the turned-down cups; the Kuan had a turned-down
cup-stand, too! If the Kuan knew good form, who does not know good
form?<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>23. The Master said to the Great Master<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_35">[35]</a> of Lu, We can learn how to
play music; at first each part in unison; then a swell of harmony,
each part distinct, rolling on to the finish.</p>
<p>24. The warden of Yi asked to see Confucius, saying, No gentleman has
ever come here whom I have failed to see.</p>
<p>The followers took him in.</p>
<p>On leaving he said, My two-three boys, why lament your fall? The Way
has long been lost below heaven! Now Heaven shall make the Master into
a warning bell.</p>
<p>25. The Master said of the music of Shao, It is thoroughly beautiful,
and thoroughly good, too. Of the music of Wu, he said, It is
thoroughly beautiful, but not thoroughly good.</p>
<p>26. The Master said, Rank without beauty; ceremony without reverence;

<h2><a id="BOOK_IV"></a>BOOK IV</h2>
<p>1. The Master said, Love makes a spot beautiful: who chooses not to
dwell in love, has he got wisdom?</p>
<p>2. The Master said, Loveless men cannot bear need long, they cannot
bear fortune long. Loving men find peace in love, the wise find profit
in it.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, Love alone can love others, or hate others.</p>
<p>4. The Master said, A will set on love is free from evil.</p>
<p>5. The Master said, Wealth and honours are what men desire; but do not
go from the Way, to keep them. Lowliness and want are hated by men;
but do not go from the Way, to escape them.</p>
<p>Shorn of love, is a gentleman worthy of the name? Not for one moment
may a gentleman sin against love; he must not do so in flurry and
haste, nor do so in utter overthrow.</p>
<p>6. The Master said, I have seen no one that loves love and hates
uncharity. He that loves love will set nothing higher. The hater of
uncharity is so given to love that no uncharity can enter into his
life. If a man were to give his strength to love for one day, I have
seen no one whose strength would fail him. There may be such men, but
I have not seen one.</p>
<p>7. The Master said, A man and his faults are of a piece. By watching
his faults we learn whether love be his.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>8. The Master said, To learn the Way at daybreak and die at eve were
enough.</p>
<p>9. The Master said, A knight<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36_36">[36]</a> in quest of the Way, who is ashamed
of bad clothes and bad food, it is idle talking to.</p>
<p>10. The Master said, A gentleman has no likes or dislikes below
heaven. He follows right.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, The gentleman cherishes mind, the small man
cherishes dirt. Gentlemen trust in the law, the small man trusts in
favour.</p>
<p>12. The Master said, The chase of gain is rich in hate.</p>
<p>13. The Master said, What is it to sway a kingdom by courteous
yielding? If we cannot sway a kingdom by courteous yielding, what is
our courtesy worth?</p>
<p>14. The Master said, Care not for want of place; care for thy
readiness to fill one. Care not for being unknown, but seek to be
worthy of note.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, One line, Shen,<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37_37">[37]</a> runs through my Way.</p>
<p>Yes, said Tseng-tzu.</p>
<p>After the Master had left, the disciples asked what was meant.</p>
<p>Tseng-tzu said, The Master's Way is no more than faithfulness and
fellow-feeling.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, The gentleman is learned in right; the small man
is learned in gain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p><p>17. The Master said, At sight of worth, think to grow like it; at
sight of baseness, search thyself within.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, A father or a mother may be gently chidden. If
thou seest they have no will to follow thee, be the more lowly, but do
not give way; nor murmur at the trouble they give thee.</p>
<p>19. The Master said, Whilst thy father and mother are living, do not
wander afar. If thou must travel, hold a set course.</p>
<p>20. The Master said, He that changes nothing in his father's ways for
three years may be called pious.</p>
<p>21. The Master said, A father and mother's years must be borne in
mind; with gladness on the one hand and fear on the other.</p>
<p>22. The Master said, The men of old were loth to speak, for not to
live up to their words would have shamed them.</p>
<p>23. The Master said, We shall seldom get lost if we hold to main
lines.</p>
<p>24. The Master said, A gentleman wishes to be slow to speak and quick
to do.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, A great soul is never friendless: he has always
neighbours.</p>
<p>26. Tzu-yu said, Nagging at kings brings disgrace, nagging at friends
estrangement.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_V"></a>BOOK V</h2>
<p>1. Of Kung-yeh Ch'ang the Master said, A girl might be wedded to him.
Though he has been in fetters that was not his crime.</p>
<p>He gave him his daughter to wed.</p>
<p>Of Nan Jung the Master said, When the land keeps the Way he will not
be neglected; and if the land loses the Way he will escape punishment
and death.</p>
<p>He gave him his brother's daughter to wed.</p>
<p>2. Of Tzu-chien<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38_38">[38]</a> the Master said, What a gentleman he is! But if
there were no gentlemen in Lu, where could he have picked it up?</p>
<p>3. Tzu-kung asked, And what of me?</p>
<p>Thou art a vessel, said the Master.</p>
<p>What kind of vessel?</p>
<p>A rich temple vessel.</p>
<p>4. One said, Yung<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39_39">[39]</a> has love, but he is not glib.</p>
<p>The Master said, What is the good of being glib? Fighting men with
tongue-craft mostly makes men hate you. Whether love be his I do not
know, but what is the good of being glib?</p>
<p>5. The Master moved Ch'i-tiao K'ai to take office.</p>
<p>He answered, For this I want confidence.</p>
<p>The Master was pleased.</p>
<p>6. The Master said, Forsaken is the Way! I must <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>take ship and stem
the seas; and Yu<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_40">[40]</a> shall go with me.</p>
<p>When Tzu-lu heard this he was glad.</p>
<p>The Master said, Yu loves daring more than I do, but he is at a loss
how to take things.</p>
<p>7. Meng Wu asked whether Tzu-lu had love.</p>
<p>I do not know, said the Master.</p>
<p>He asked again.</p>
<p>A land of a thousand chariots might give Yu charge of its levies; but
whether love be his I do not know.</p>
<p>And how about Ch'iu?<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>A town of a thousand households, a clan of an hundred chariots might
make Ch'iu governor; but whether love be his I do not know.</p>
<p>And how about Ch'ih?<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Standing in the court, girt with his sash, Ch'ih might entertain the
guests; but whether love be his I do not know.</p>
<p>8. The Master said to Tzu-kung, Which is the better man, thou or
Hui<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43_43">[43]</a>?</p>
<p>He answered, How dare I look as high as Hui? When Hui hears one thing,
he understands ten; when I hear one thing I understand two.</p>
<p>The Master said, Thou art not his like. Neither art thou his like, nor
am I.</p>
<p>9. Tsai Yü<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44_44">[44]</a> slept in the daytime.</p>
<p>The Master said, Rotten wood cannot be carved, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>nor are dung walls
plastered. Why chide with Yü?</p>
<p>The Master said, When I first met men I listened to their words and
took their deeds on trust. When I meet them now, I listen to their
words and watch their deeds. I righted this on Yü.</p>
<p>10. The Master said, I have met no firm man.</p>
<p>One answered, Shen Ch'ang.</p>
<p>The Master said, Ch'ang is passionate; how can he be firm?</p>
<p>11. Tzu-kung said, What I do not wish done to me, I likewise wish not
to do to others.</p>
<p>The Master said, That is still beyond thee, Tz'u.</p>
<p>12. Tzu-kung said, To hear the Master on his art and precepts is
granted us; but to hear him on man's nature and the Way of Heaven is
not.</p>
<p>13. Until Tzu-lu could do what he had heard, his only fear was to hear
more.</p>
<p>14. Tzu-kung asked, Why was K'ung-wen called cultured?</p>
<p>The Master said, He was quick and loved learning; he was not ashamed
to ask those beneath him: that is why he was called cultured.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, Of the ways of a gentleman Tzu-ch'an had four.
His life was modest; he honoured those that he served. He was kind in
feeding the people, and he was just in his calls upon them.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Yen P'ing was a good friend. The longer he knew
you, the more attentive he grew.</p>
<p>17. The Master said, Tsang Wen lodged his tortoise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> with hills on the
pillars and reeds on the uprights: was this his wisdom?</p>
<p>18. Tzu-chang said, The chief minister, Tzu-wen, was thrice made
minister without showing gladness, thrice he left office with unmoved
looks. He always told the new ministers how the old ones had governed:
how was that?</p>
<p>He was faithful, said the Master.</p>
<p>But was it love?</p>
<p>I do not know, said the Master: how should this amount to love?</p>
<p>When Ts'ui murdered the lord of Ch'i, Ch'en Wen threw up ten teams of
horses and left the land. On coming to another kingdom he said, 'Like
my lord Ts'ui,' and left it. On coming to a second kingdom he said
again, 'Like my lord Ts'ui,' and left it: how was that?</p>
<p>He was clean, said the Master.</p>
<p>But was it love?</p>
<p>I do not know, said the Master: how should this amount to love?</p>
<p>19. Chi Wen thought thrice before acting.</p>
<p>On hearing this the Master said, Twice is enough.</p>
<p>20. The Master said, Whilst the land kept the Way Ning Wu showed
wisdom; when his land lost the Way he grew simple. His wisdom we may
come up to; such simplicity is beyond us.<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_45">[45]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p><p>21. When he was in Ch'en the Master said, Home, I must go home!
Zealous, or rash, or finished scholars, my young sons at home do not
know what pruning they still need!</p>
<p>22. The Master said, Because Po-yi and Shu-ch'i never remembered old
wickedness they made few enemies.<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>23. The Master said, Who can call Wei-sheng Kao straight? A man begged
him for vinegar: he begged it of a neighbour, and gave it.</p>
<p>24. The Master said, Smooth words, fawning looks, and overdone
humility, Tso Ch'iu-ming thought shameful, and so do I. He thought it
shameful to hide ill-will and ape friendship, and so do I.</p>
<p>25. As Yen Yüan and Chi-lu<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_47">[47]</a> were sitting with him, the Master said,
Why not each of you tell me thy wishes?</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said, I should like carriages and horses, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>and clothes of light
fur to share with my friends, and, if they spoiled them, not to get
angry.</p>
<p>Yen Yüan said, I should like to make no boast of talent or show or
merit.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said, We should like to hear your wishes, Sir.</p>
<p>The Master said, To give the old folk peace, to be true to friends,
and to have a heart for the young.</p>
<p>26. The Master said, It is finished! I have met no one that can see
his own faults and arraign himself within.</p>
<p>27. The Master said, In a hamlet of ten houses there must be men that
are as faithful and true men as I, but they do not love learning as I
do.</p>

the tyrant Chou (1122 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>), they starved to death, rather than live
under a new dynasty. Of Po-yi Mencius tells us (Book X, chapter 1):
'His eyes would not look on an evil face, his ears would not listen to
an evil sound. He served none but his own lord, he ruled none but his
own people. He came in when there was order, and withdrew when tumults
came. Where lawless rule showed, or lawless people stayed, he could
not bear to dwell. To be together with country folk he thought like
sitting in court dress and court cap on dust and ashes. In Chou's time
he dwelt by the North Sea shore, waiting for all below heaven to grow
clean. So, hearing the ways of Po-yi, the fool grows honest, and the

<p>1. The Master said, Yung<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_48">[48]</a> might fill the seat of a prince.</p>
<p>And might Tzu-sang Po-tzu? asked Chung-kung.</p>
<p>Yes, said the Master; but he is slack.</p>
<p>To be stern to himself, said Chung-kung, and slack in his claims on
the people, might do; but to be slack himself and slack with others
must surely be too slack.</p>
<p>The Master said, What Yung says is true.</p>
<p>2. Duke Ai asked which disciples loved learning.</p>
<p>Confucius answered, Yen Hui<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_49">[49]</a> loved learning. He did not carry over
anger; he made no mistake twice. Alas! his mission was short, he died.
Now that he is gone, I hear of no one that loves learning.</p>
<p>3. When Tzu-hua<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_50">[50]</a> was sent to Ch'i, the disciple Jan asked for grain
for his mother.</p>
<p>The Master said, Give her six pecks.</p>
<p>He asked for more.</p>
<p>The Master said, Give her sixteen.</p>
<p>Jan gave her eight hundred.</p>
<p>The Master said, On his way to Ch'i, Ch'ih<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_51">[51]</a> was drawn by sleek
horses and clad in light furs. I have heard that gentlemen help the
needy, not that they swell riches.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p><p>When Yüan Ssu was made governor he was given nine hundred measures of
grain, which he refused.</p>
<p>Not so, said the Master: why not take it and give it to thy neighbours
and countryfolk?</p>
<p>4. The Master said of Chung-kung, If the calf of a brindled cow be red
and horned, though men be shy to offer him, will the hills and streams
reject him?</p>
<p>5. The Master said, For three months together Hui's<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52_52">[52]</a> heart never
sinned against love. The others may hold out for a day, or a month,
but no more.</p>
<p>6. Chi K'ang<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53_53">[53]</a> asked whether Chung-yu<a id="FNanchor_54_1_54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54_54">[54]</a> was fit to govern.</p>
<p>The Master said, Yu<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54_54">[54]</a> is firm; what would governing be to him?</p>
<p>And is Tz'u<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55_55">[55]</a> fit to govern?</p>
<p>Tz'u is thorough; what would governing be to him?</p>
<p>And is Ch'iu<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56_56">[56]</a> fit to govern?</p>
<p>Ch'in is clever; what would governing be to him?</p>
<p>7. The Chi sent to make Min Tzu-ch'ien<a id="FNanchor_57_1_57_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">[57]</a> governor of Pi.</p>
<p>Min Tzu-ch'ien said, Make some good excuse for me. If he sends again I
must be across the Wen.</p>
<p>8. When Po-niu<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">[57]</a> was ill the Master asked after him. Grasping his
hand through the window, he said, He is going. It is the Bidding; but
why this <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>man of such an illness? Why this man of such an illness?</p>
<p>9. The Master said. What a man was Hui!<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58_58">[58]</a> A bowl of rice, a gourd of
water, in a low alley; man cannot bear such misery! Yet Hui never fell
from mirth. What a man he was!</p>
<p>10. Jan Ch'iu<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59_59">[59]</a> said, It is not that I take no pleasure in the
Master's Way: I want strength.</p>
<p>The Master said, He that wants strength faints midway; but thou
drawest a line.</p>
<p>11. The Master said to Tzu-hsia, Study to be a gentleman, not as the
small man studies.</p>
<p>12. When Tzu-yu was governor of Wu-ch'eng, the Master said, Hast thou
gotten any men?</p>
<p>He answered, I have Tan-t'ai Mieh-ming. He will not take a short cut
when walking, and he has never come to my house except on business.</p>
<p>13. The Master said, Meng Chih-fan never brags. He was covering the
rear in a rout; but on coming to the gate he whipped his horse and
cried, Not courage kept me behind; my horse won't go!</p>
<p>14. The Master said, Unless we are glib as the reader T'o and fair as
Chao of Sung, escape is hard in the times that be!</p>
<p>15. The Master said, Who can go out except by the door? Why is it no
one keeps to the Way?</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Matter outweighing art begets roughness; art
outweighing matter begets pedantry. Matter and art well blent make a
gentleman.</p>
<p>17. The Master said, Man is born straight. If <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>he grows crooked and
yet lives, he is lucky to escape.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, He that knows is below him that loves, and he
that loves below him that delights therein.</p>
<p>19. The Master said, To men above the common we can talk of higher
things; to men below the common we must not talk of higher things.</p>
<p>20. Fan Ch'ih<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60_60">[60]</a> asked, What is wisdom?</p>
<p>The Master said, To foster right among the people; to honour ghosts
and spirits, and yet keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.</p>
<p>He asked, What is love?</p>
<p>The Master said, To rank the effort above the prize may be called
love.</p>
<p>21. The Master said, Wisdom delights in water; love delights in hills.
Wisdom is stirring; love is quiet. Wisdom is merry; love grows old.</p>
<p>22. The Master said, By one revolution Ch'i might grow to be Lu; by
one revolution Lu might reach the Way.</p>
<p>23. The Master said, A drinking horn that is no horn! What a horn!
What a drinking horn!</p>
<p>24. Tsai Wo<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61_61">[61]</a> said, If a man of love were told that a man is in a
well, would he go in after him?</p>
<p>The Master said, Why should he? A gentleman might be got to the well,
but not trapped into it, He may be cheated, but not fooled.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, By breadth of reading and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>the ties of courtesy,
a gentleman is kept, too, from false paths.</p>
<p>26. The Master saw Nan-tzu.<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62_62">[62]</a> Tzu-lu was displeased.</p>
<p>The Master took an oath, saying, If I have done wrong, may Heaven
forsake me, may Heaven forsake me!</p>
<p>27. The Master said, The highest minds cleave to the Centre, the
Common. They have long been rare among the people.</p>
<p>28. Tzu-kung said, To treat the people with bounty and help the many,
how were that? Could it be called love?</p>
<p>The Master said, What has this to do with love? Must it not be
holiness? Yao and Shun<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63_63">[63]</a> still yearned for this. Seeking a foothold
for self, love finds a foothold for others; seeking light for itself,
it enlightens others too. To learn from the near at hand may be called
the clue to love.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_VII"></a>BOOK VII</h2>
<p>1. The Master said, A teller and not a maker, one that trusts and
loves the past; I might liken myself to our old P'eng.<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64_64">[64]</a></p>
<p>2. The Master said, To think things over in silence, to learn and be
always hungry, to teach and never weary; is any of these mine?</p>
<p>3. The Master said, Not making the most of my mind, want of
thoroughness in learning, failure to do the right when told it, lack
of strength to overcome faults; these are my sorrows.</p>
<p>4. In his free moments the Master was easy and cheerful.</p>
<p>5. The Master said, How deep is my decay! It is long since I saw the
Duke of Chou<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65_65">[65]</a> in a dream.</p>
<p>6. The Master said, Keep thy will on the Way, lean on mind, rest in
love, move in art.</p>
<p>7. The Master said, From the man that paid in dried meat upwards, I
have withheld teaching from no one.</p>
<p>8. The Master said, Only to those fumbling do I open, only for those
stammering do I find the word.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p><p>If I lift one corner and the other three are left unturned, I say no
more.</p>
<p>9. When eating beside a mourner the Master never ate his fill. On days
when he had been wailing, he did not sing.</p>
<p>10. The Master said to Yen Yüan, To go forward when in office and lie
quiet when not; only I and thou can do that.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said, If ye had to lead three armies, Sir, whom would ye have
with you?</p>
<p>No man, said the Master, that would face a tiger bare-fisted, or
plunge into a river and die without a qualm; but one, indeed, who,
fearing what may come, lays his plans well and carries them through.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, If shouldering a whip were a sure road to riches
I should turn carter; but since there is no sure road, I tread the
path I love.</p>
<p>12. The Master gave heed to abstinence, war and sickness.</p>
<p>13. When he was in Ch'i, for three months after hearing the Shao
played, the Master knew not the taste of flesh.</p>
<p>I did not suppose, he said, that music could reach such heights.</p>
<p>14. Jan Yu said, Is the Master for the lord of Wei?<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66_66">[66]</a></p>
<p>I shall ask him, said Tzu-kung.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p><p>He went in, and said, What kind of men were Po-yi<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67_67">[67]</a> and Shu-ch'i?</p>
<p>Worthy men of yore, said the Master.</p>
<p>Did they rue the past?</p>
<p>They sought love and found it; what had they to rue?</p>
<p>Tzu-kung went out, and said, The Master is not for him.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, Eating coarse rice and drinking water, with bent
arm for pillow, we may be merry; but ill-gotten wealth and honours are
to me a wandering cloud.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Given a few more years, making fifty for learning
the Yi,<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68_68">[68]</a> I might be freed from gross faults.</p>
<p>17. The Master liked to talk of poetry, history, and the upkeep of
courtesy. Of all these he liked to talk.</p>
<p>18. The Duke of She asked Tzu-lu about Confucius.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu did not answer.</p>
<p>The Master said, Why didst thou not say, He is a man that forgets to
eat in his eagerness, whose sorrows are forgotten in gladness, who
knows not that age draws near?</p>
<p>19. The Master said, I was not born to wisdom: I loved the past, and
sought it earnestly there.</p>
<p>20. The Master never talked of goblins, strength, disorder, or
spirits.</p>
<p>21. The Master said, Walking three together I am <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>sure of teachers. I
pick out the good and follow it; I see the bad and shun it.</p>
<p>22. The Master said, Heaven begat the mind in me; what can Huan
T'ui<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69_69">[69]</a> do to me?</p>
<p>23. The Master said, My two-three boys, do ye think I hide things? I
hide nothing from you. I am a man that keeps none of his doings from
his two-three boys.</p>
<p>24. The Master taught four things: art, conduct, faithfulness and
truth.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, A holy man I shall not live to see; enough could
I find a gentleman! A good man I shall not live to see; enough could I
find a steadfast one! But when nothing poses as something, cloud as
substance and want as riches, it is hard indeed to be steadfast!</p>
<p>26. The Master angled, but he did not fish with a net; he shot, but
not at birds sitting.</p>
<p>27. The Master said, There may be men that do things without knowing
why. I do not. To hear much, pick out the good and follow it; to see
much and think it over; this comes next to wisdom.</p>
<p>28. To talk to the Hu village was hard. When a lad was seen by the
Master, the disciples doubted.</p>
<p>The Master said, I allow his coming, not what he does later. Why be so
harsh? If a man cleans himself to come in, I admit his cleanness, but
do not warrant his past.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p><p>29. The Master said, Is love so far a thing? I long for love, and lo!
love is come.</p>
<p>30. A judge of Ch'en asked whether Duke Chao<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70_70">[70]</a> knew good form.</p>
<p>Confucius answered, He knew good form.</p>
<p>After Confucius had left, the judge beckoned Wu-ma Ch'i<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71_71">[71]</a> to him,
and said, I had heard that gentlemen are of no party, but do they,
too, take sides? This lord married a Wu, whose name was the same as
his, and called her Miss Tzu of Wu: if he knew good form, who does not
know good form?</p>
<p>When Wu-ma Ch'i told the Master this he said, How lucky I am! If I go
wrong, men are sure to know it!</p>
<p>31. When anyone sang to the Master, and sang well, he made him sing it
again and joined in.</p>
<p>32. The Master said, I have no more reading than others; to live as a
gentleman is not yet mine.</p>
<p>33. The Master said, How dare I lay claim to holiness or love? A man
of endless craving, who never tires of teaching, I might be called,
but that is all.</p>
<p>That is just what we disciples cannot learn, said Kung-hsi Hua.</p>
<p>34. When the Master was very ill, Tzu-lu asked leave to pray.</p>
<p>Is it done? said the Master.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p><p>It is, answered Tzu-lu. The Memorials say, Pray to the spirits above
and to the Earth below.</p>
<p>The Master said, Long-lasting has my prayer been.</p>
<p>35. The Master said, Waste makes men unruly, thrift makes them mean;
but they are better mean than unruly.</p>
<p>36. The Master said, A gentleman is calm and spacious; the small man
is always fretting.</p>
<p>37. The Master's manner was warm yet dignified. He was stern, but not
fierce; humble, yet easy.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_VIII"></a>BOOK VIII</h2>
<p>1. The Master said, T'ai-po<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_72_72">[72]</a> may be said to have carried nobility
furthest. Thrice he refused all below heaven. Men were at a loss how
to praise him.</p>
<p>2. The Master said, Without good form attentions grow into fussiness,
heed becomes fearfulness, daring becomes unruliness, frankness becomes
rudeness. When gentlemen are true to kinsfolk, love will thrive among
the people; if they do not forsake old friends, the people will not
steal.</p>
<p>3. When Tseng-tzu lay sick he called his disciples and said, Uncover
my feet, uncover my arms. The poem says,</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As if a deep gulf<br></span>
<span class="i2">Were yawning below,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As crossing thin ice,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Take heed how ye go.<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>My little children, I have known how to keep myself unhurt until now
and hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73_73">[73]</a></p>
<p>4. When Tseng-tzu was sick Meng Ching<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74_74">[74]</a> came to ask after him.</p>
<p>Tseng-tzu said, When a bird is dying his notes are <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>sad; when man is
dying his words are good. Three branches of the Way are dear to a
gentleman: To banish from his bearing violence and disdain; to sort
his face to the truth, and to banish from his speech what is low or
unseemly. The ritual of chalice and platter<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75_75">[75]</a> has servitors to see
to it.</p>
<p>5. Tseng-tzu said, When we can, to ask those that cannot; when we are
more, to ask those that are less; having, to seem wanting; real, to
seem shadow; when gainsaid, never answering back; I had a friend<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76_76">[76]</a>
once that could do thus.</p>
<p>6. Tseng-tzu said, A man to whom an orphan, a few feet high, or the
fate of an hundred towns, may be entrusted, and whom no crisis can
corrupt, is he not a gentleman, a gentleman indeed?</p>
<p>7. Tseng-tzu said, The knight had need be strong and bold; for his
burden is heavy, the way is far. His burden is love, is it not a heavy
one? No halt before death, is that not far?</p>
<p>8. The Master said, Poetry rouses us, we stand upon courtesy, music is
our crown.</p>
<p>9. The Master said, The people may be made to follow, we cannot make
them understand.</p>
<p>10. The Master said, Love of daring and hatred of poverty lead to
crime; a man without love, if he is sorely harassed, turns to crime.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, All the comely gifts of the Duke of Chou,<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77_77">[77]</a>
coupled with pride and meanness, would not be worth a glance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p><p>12. The Master said, A man to whom three years of learning have borne
no fruit would be hard to find.</p>
<p>13. The Master said, A man of simple faith, who loves learning, who
guards and betters his way unto death, will not enter a tottering
kingdom, nor stay in a lawless land. When all below heaven follows the
Way, he is seen; when it loses the Way, he is unseen. While his land
keeps the Way, he is ashamed to be poor and lowly; but when his land
has lost the Way, wealth and honours shame him.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, When out of place, discuss not policy.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, In the first days of the music-master Chih how
the hubbub<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_78_78">[78]</a> of the Kuan-chü rose sea beyond sea! How it filled the
ear!</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Of men that are zealous, but not straight; dull,
but not simple; helpless, but not truthful, I will know nothing.</p>
<p>17. The Master said, Learn as though the time were short, like one
that fears to lose.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, How wonderful were Shun<a id="FNanchor_79_1_79"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79_79">[79]</a> and Yü<a id="FNanchor_79_2_79"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79_79">[79]</a>! To have all
below heaven was nothing to them!</p>
<p>19. The Master said, How great a lord was Yao<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79_79">[79]</a>! Wonderful! Heaven
alone is great; Yao alone was patterned on it. Vast, boundless! Men's
words failed them. The wonder of the work done by him! The flame of
his art and precepts!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p><p>20. Shun had five ministers, and there was order below heaven.</p>
<p>King Wu<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80_80">[80]</a> said, I have ten uncommon ministers.</p>
<p>Confucius said, 'The dearth of talent,' is not that the truth? When
Yü<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81_81">[81]</a> followed T'ang<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_82_82">[82]</a> the times were rich in talent; yet there
were but nine men in all, and one woman. In greatness of soul we may
say that Chou<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_83_83">[83]</a> was highest: he had two-thirds of all below heaven
and bent it to the service of Yin.</p>
<p>21. The Master said, I see no flaw in Yü. He ate and drank little, yet
he was lavish in piety to the ghosts and spirits. His clothes were
bad, but in his cap and gown he was fair indeed. His palace buildings
were poor, yet he gave his whole strength to dykes and ditches. No
kind of flaw can I see in Yü.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_IX"></a>BOOK IX</h2>
<p>1. The Master seldom spake of gain, or love, or the Bidding.</p>
<p>2. A man of the village of Ta-hsiang said, The great Confucius, with
his vast learning, has made no name in anything.</p>
<p>When the Master heard this, he said to his disciples, What shall I
take up? Shall I take up driving, or shall I take up shooting? I shall
take up driving.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, A linen cap is good form; now silk is worn. It is
cheap, so I follow the many. To bow below is good form; now it is done
above. This is arrogance, so, breaking with the many, I still bow
below.</p>
<p>4. From four things the Master was quite free: by-ends and 'must' and
'shall' and 'I.'</p>
<p>5. When he was afraid in K'uang,<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_84_84">[84]</a> the Master said, Since the death
of King Wen, is not the seat of culture here? If Heaven had meant to
destroy our culture, a later mortal would have had no part in it.
Until Heaven condemns our culture, what can the men of K'uang do to
me?</p>
<p>6. A high minister said to Tzu-kung, The Master must be a holy man, he
can do so many things!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><p>Tzu-kung said, Heaven has, indeed, given him so much that he is almost
holy, and he can do many things, too.</p>
<p>When the Master heard this, he said, Does the minister know me?
Because I was poor when young, I can do many paltry things. But does
doing many things make a gentleman? No, not doing many does.</p>
<p>Lao said, The Master would say, As I had no post I learned the crafts.</p>
<p>7. The Master said, Have I in truth wisdom? I have no wisdom. But when
a common fellow emptily asks me anything, I tap it on this side and
that, and sift it to the bottom.</p>
<p>8. The Master said, The phœnix comes not, the River gives forth no
sign: all is over with me!</p>
<p>9. When the Master saw folk clad in mourning, or in cap and gown, or a
blind man, he always rose—even for the young,—or, if he was passing
them, he quickened his step.</p>
<p>10. Yen Yüan heaved a sigh, and said, As I look up it grows higher,
deeper as I dig! I catch sight of it ahead, and on a sudden it is
behind me! The Master leads men on, deftly bit by bit. He widens me
with culture, he binds me with courtesy. If I wished to stop I could
not until my strength were spent. What seems the mark stands near; but
though I long to reach it, I find no way.</p>
<p>11. When the Master was very ill, Tzu-lu made the disciples act as
ministers.</p>
<p>During a better spell the Master said, Yu has long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> been feigning.
This show of ministers, when I have no ministers, whom will it take
in? Will Heaven be taken in? And is it not better to die in the arms
of my two-three boys than to die in the arms of ministers? And, if I
miss a big burial, shall I die by the roadside?</p>
<p>12. Tzu-kung said, If I had here a fair piece of jade, should I hide
it away in a case, or seek a good price and sell it?</p>
<p>Sell it, sell it! said the Master. I tarry for my price.</p>
<p>13. The Master wished to dwell among the nine tribes.<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>One said, They are low; how could ye?</p>
<p>The Master said, Wherever a gentleman lives, will there be anything
low?</p>
<p>14. The Master said. After I came back from Wei to Lu the music was
set straight and each song found its place.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, To serve dukes and ministers abroad and father
and brothers at home; in matters of mourning not to dare to be slack;
and to be no thrall to wine: to which of these have I won?</p>
<p>16. As he stood by a stream, the Master said, Hasting away like this,
day and night, without stop!</p>
<p>17. The Master said, I have seen no one that loves mind as he loves
looks.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, In making a mound, if I stop when one more basket
would finish it, I stop. When <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>flattening ground, if, after
overturning one basket, I go on, I go ahead.</p>
<p>19. The Master said, Never listless when spoken to, such was Hui.<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_86_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>20. Speaking of Yen Yüan, the Master said, The pity of it! I saw him
go on, but I never saw him stop!</p>
<p>21. The Master said, Some sprouts do not blossom, some blossoms bear
no fruit!</p>
<p>22. The Master said, Awe is due to youth. May not to-morrow be bright
as to-day? To men of forty or fifty, who are still unknown, no awe is
due.</p>
<p>23. The Master said, Who would not give ear to a downright word? But
to mend is better. Who would not be pleased by a guiding word? But to
think it out is better. With such as are pleased but do not think out,
or who listen but do not mend, I can do nothing.</p>
<p>24. The Master said, Put faithfulness and truth first; have no friends
unlike thyself; be not ashamed to mend thy faults.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, Three armies may be robbed of their leader, no
wretch can be robbed of his will.</p>
<p>26. The Master said, Yu<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_87_87">[87]</a> is the man to stand, clad in a worn-out
quilted gown, unashamed, amid robes of fox and badger!</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Without hatred or greed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What but good does he do?<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>But when Tzu-lu was everlastingly humming these words, the Master
said, This is the way towards it, but how much short of goodness
itself!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p><p>27. The Master said, Erst the cold days show how fir and cypress are
last to fade.</p>
<p>28. The Master said, Wisdom has no doubts; love does not fret; the
bold have no fears.</p>
<p>29. The Master said, With some we can learn together, but we cannot go
their way; we can go the same way with others, though our standpoint
is not the same; and with some, though our standpoint is the same our
weights and scales are not.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_X"></a>BOOK X</h2>
<p>1. Among his own country folk Confucius wore a homely look, like one
that has no word to say.</p>
<p>In the ancestral temple and at court his speech was full, but
cautious.</p>
<p>2. At court he talked frankly to men of low rank, winningly to men of
high rank. When the king was there, he looked intent and solemn.</p>
<p>3. When the king bade him receive guests, his face seemed to change
and his legs to bend. He bowed left and right to those beside him,
straightened his robes in front and behind, and swept forward, with
arms spread like wings. When the guest had left, he brought back word,
saying, The guest is no longer looking.</p>
<p>4. As he went in at the palace gate he stooped, as though it were too
low for him. He did not stand in the middle of the gate, or step on
the threshold.</p>
<p>When he passed the throne, his face seemed to change and his legs to
bend: he spake with bated breath. As he went up the hall to audience,
he lifted his robes, bowed his back, and masked his breathing till it
seemed to stop. As he came down, he relaxed his face below the first
step and looked pleased. From the foot of the steps he swept forward
with arms spread like wings; and when he was back in his seat, he
looked intent as before.</p>
<p>5. When he carried the sceptre, his back bent, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> under too heavy a
burden; he lifted it no higher than in bowing and no lower than in
making a gift. His face changed, as it will with fear, and he dragged
his feet, as though they were fettered.</p>
<p>When he offered his present his manner was formal; but at the private
audience he was cheerful.</p>
<p>6. The gentleman was never decked in violet or mauve; even at home he
would not wear red or purple.</p>
<p>In hot weather he wore an unlined linen gown, but always over other
clothes.</p>
<p>With lamb-skin he wore black, with fawn, white, and with fox-skin,
yellow. At home he wore a long fur gown, with the right sleeve short.</p>
<p>His nightgown was always half as long again as his body.</p>
<p>In the house he wore thick fur, of fox or badger.</p>
<p>When he was not in mourning there was nothing missing from his girdle.</p>
<p>Except for sacrificial dress, he was sparing of stuff.</p>
<p>He did not wear lamb's fur, or a black cap, on a mourning visit.</p>
<p>At the new moon he always put on court dress and went to court.</p>
<p>7. On his days of abstinence he always wore linen clothes of a pale
colour; and he changed his food and moved from his wonted seat.</p>
<p>8. He did not dislike well-cleaned rice or hash chopped small. He did
not eat sour or mouldy rice, bad fish, or tainted flesh. He did not
eat anything that had a bad colour or that smelt bad, or food that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was badly cooked or out of season. Food that was badly cut or served
with the wrong sauce he did not eat. However much flesh there might
be, it could not conquer his taste for rice. To wine alone he set no
limit, but he did not drink enough to muddle him. He did not drink
bought wine, or eat ready-dried market meat. He never went without
ginger at a meal. He did not eat much.</p>
<p>After a sacrifice at the palace he did not keep the flesh over-night.
He never kept sacrificial flesh more than three days. If it had been
kept longer it was not eaten.</p>
<p>He did not talk at meals, nor speak when he was in bed.</p>
<p>Even at a meal of coarse rice, or herb broth, or gourds, he made his
offering with all reverence.</p>
<p>9. If his mat was not straight, he would not sit down.</p>
<p>10. When the villagers were drinking wine, as those that walked with a
staff left, he left too.</p>
<p>At the village exorcisms he put on court dress and stood on the east
steps.</p>
<p>11. When sending a man with enquiries to another land, he bowed twice
to him and saw him out.</p>
<p>When K'ang gave him some drugs, he bowed, accepted them, and said, I
have never taken them; I dare not taste them.</p>
<p>12. On coming back from court after his stables had been burnt, the
Master said, Is anyone hurt? He did not ask about the horses.</p>
<p>13. When the king sent him cooked meat, he put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> his mat straight, and
tasted it first; when he sent him raw flesh, he had it cooked, and
offered it to the spirits; when he sent him a live beast, he kept it
alive.</p>
<p>When he ate in attendance on the king, the king made the offering, he
tasted things first.</p>
<p>When he was sick and the king came to see him, he lay with his head to
the east, with his court dress over him and his girdle across it.</p>
<p>When he was called by the king's bidding, he walked, without waiting
for his carriage.</p>
<p>14. On going into the Great Temple he asked about everything.</p>
<p>15. When a friend died, who had no home to go to, he said, It is for
me to bury him.</p>
<p>When friends sent him anything, even a carriage and horses, he never
bowed, unless the gift was sacrificial flesh.</p>
<p>16. He did not sleep like a corpse. At home he unbent.</p>
<p>Even if he knew him well, his face changed when he saw a mourner. Even
when he was in undress, if he saw anyone in full dress, or a blind
man, he looked grave.</p>
<p>To men in deep mourning and to the census-bearers he bowed over the
cross-bar.</p>
<p>Before choice meats he rose with changed look. At sharp thunder, or a
fierce wind, his look changed.</p>
<p>17. When mounting his carriage he stood straight and grasped the cord.
When he was in it, he did not look round, or speak fast, or point.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>18. Seeing a man's face, she rose, flew round and settled. The Master
said, Hen pheasant on the ridge, it is the season, it is the season.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu went towards her: she sniffed thrice and rose.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_88_88">[88]</a></p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XI"></a>BOOK XI</h2>
<p>1. The Master said, Savages! the men that first went into courtesy and
music! Gentlemen! those that went into them later! My use is to follow
the first lead in both.</p>
<p>2. The Master said, Not one of my followers in Ch'en or Ts'ai comes
any more to my door! Yen Yüan, Min Tzu-ch'ien, Jan Po-niu and
Chung-kung were men of noble life; Tsai Wo and Tzu-kung were the
talkers; Jan Yu and Chi-lu were statesmen; Tzu-yu and Tzu-hsia, men of
arts and learning.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, I get no help from Hui.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89_89">[89]</a> No word I say but
delights him!</p>
<p>4. The Master said, How good a son is Min Tzu-ch'ien! No one finds
fault with anything that his father, or his mother, or his brethren
say of him.</p>
<p>5. Nan Jung would thrice repeat <i>The Sceptre White</i>.<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90_90">[90]</a> Confucius
gave him his brother's daughter for wife.</p>
<p>6. Chi K'ang asked which disciples loved learning. Confucius answered,
There was Yen Hui<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_91_91">[91]</a> loved learning. Alas! his mission was short, he
died. Now there is no one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p><p>7. When Yen Yüan died, Yen Lu<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92_92">[92]</a> asked for the Master's carriage to
furnish an outer coffin.</p>
<p>The Master said, Brains or no brains, each of us speaks of his son.
When Li<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_93_93">[93]</a> died he had an inner but not an outer coffin: I would not
go on foot to furnish an outer coffin. As I follow in the wake of the
ministers I cannot go on foot.</p>
<p>8. When Yen Yüan died the Master said, Woe is me! Heaven has undone
me! Heaven has undone me!</p>
<p>9. When Yen Yüan died the Master gave way to grief.</p>
<p>His followers said, Sir, ye are giving way.</p>
<p>The Master said, Am I giving way? If I did not give way for this man,
for whom should I give way to grief?</p>
<p>10. When Yen Yüan died the disciples wished to bury him in pomp.</p>
<p>The Master said, This must not be.</p>
<p>The disciples buried him in pomp.</p>
<p>The Master said, Hui treated me as his father. I have failed to treat
him as a son. No, not I; but ye, my two-three boys.</p>
<p>11. Chi-lu<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94_94">[94]</a> asked what is due to the ghosts of the dead?</p>
<p>The Master said, When we cannot do our duty to the living, how can we
do it to the dead?</p>
<p>He dared to ask about death.</p>
<p>We know not life, said the Master, how can we know death?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p><p>12. Seeing the disciple Min standing at his side with winning looks,
Tzu-lu with warlike front, Jan Yu and Tzu-kung frank and free, the
Master's heart was glad.</p>
<p>A man like Yu,<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_95_95">[95]</a> he said, dies before his day.</p>
<p>13. The men of Lu were building the Long Treasury.</p>
<p>Min Tzu-ch'ien said, Would not the old one do? Why must it be rebuilt?</p>
<p>The Master said, That man does not talk, but when he speaks he hits
the mark.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, What has the lute of Yu<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96_96">[96]</a> to do, twanging at my
door?</p>
<p>But when the disciples looked down on Tzu-lu, the Master said, Yu has
come up into hall, but he has not yet entered the inner rooms.</p>
<p>15. Tzu-kung asked, Which is the better, Shih<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97_97">[97]</a> or Shang<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_98_98">[98]</a>?</p>
<p>The Master said, Shih goes too far, Shang not far enough.</p>
<p>Then is Shih the better? said Tzu-kung.</p>
<p>Too far, said the Master, is no nearer than not far enough.</p>
<p>16. The Chi was richer than the Duke of Chou; yet Ch'iu<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_99_99">[99]</a> became his
tax-gatherer and made him still richer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p><p>He is no disciple of mine, said the Master. My little children, ye may
beat your drums and make war on him.</p>
<p>17. Ch'ai<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100_100">[100]</a> is simple, Shen<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101_101">[101]</a> is dull, Shih<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102_102">[102]</a> is smooth,
Yu<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103_103">[103]</a> is coarse.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, Hui<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104_104">[104]</a> is almost faultless, and he is often
empty. Tz'u<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105_105">[105]</a> will not bow to the Bidding, and he heaps up riches;
but his views are often sound.</p>
<p>19. Tzu-chang asked, What is the way of a good man?</p>
<p>The Master said, He does not tread the beaten track; and yet he does
not enter the inner rooms.</p>
<p>20. The Master said, Commend a man for plain speaking: he may prove a
gentleman, or else but seeming honest.</p>
<p>21. Tzu-lu said, Shall I do all I am taught?</p>
<p>The Master said, Whilst thy father and elder brothers live, how canst
thou do all thou art taught?</p>
<p>Jan Yu asked, Shall I do all I am taught?</p>
<p>The Master said, Do all thou art taught.</p>
<p>Kung-hsi Hua said, Yu<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_106_106">[106]</a> asked, Shall I do all I am taught? and ye
said, Sir, Whilst thy father and elder brothers live. Ch'iu<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_107_107">[107]</a>
asked, Shall I do all I am taught? and ye said, Sir, Do all thou art
taught. I am in doubt, and dare to ask you, Sir.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>The Master said, Ch'iu is bashful, so I egged him on; Yu is twice a
man, so I held him back.</p>
<p>22. When the Master was in fear in K'uang, Yen Yüan fell behind.</p>
<p>The Master said, I held thee for dead.</p>
<p>He answered, Whilst my Master lives how should I dare to die?</p>
<p>23. Chi Tzu-jan<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_108_108">[108]</a> asked whether Chung Yu<a id="FNanchor_109_1_109"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109_109">[109]</a> or Jan Ch'iu<a id="FNanchor_110_1_110"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_110_110">[110]</a> could
be called a great minister.</p>
<p>The Master said, I thought ye would ask me a riddle, Sir, and ye ask
about Yu<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109_109">[109]</a> and Ch'iu.<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_110_110">[110]</a> He that holds to the Way in serving his
lord and leaves when he cannot do so, we call a great minister. Now Yu
and Ch'iu I should call tools.</p>
<p>Who are just followers then?</p>
<p>Nor would they follow, said the Master, if told to kill their lord or
father.</p>
<p>24. Tzu-lu made Tzu-kao governor of Pi.</p>
<p>The Master said, Thou art undoing a man's son.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said, What with the people and the spirits of earth and corn,
must a man read books to become learned?</p>
<p>The Master said, This is why I hate a glib tongue.</p>
<p>25. The Master said to Tzu-lu, Tseng Hsi,<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_111_111">[111]</a> Jan Yu and Kung-hsi Hua
as they sat beside him, I may be a day older than you, but forget
that. Ye are wont to say, I am unknown. Well, if ye were known, what
would ye do?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p><p>Tzu-lu answered lightly. Give me a land of a thousand chariots,
crushed between great neighbours, overrun by soldiers and searched by
famine, and within three years I could put courage into it and high
purpose.</p>
<p>The Master smiled.</p>
<p>What wouldst thou do, Ch'iu<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_112_112">[112]</a>? he said.</p>
<p>He answered, Give me a land of sixty or seventy, or fifty or sixty
square miles, and within three years I could give the people plenty.
As for courtesy and music, they would wait the coming of a gentleman.</p>
<p>And what wouldst thou do, Ch'ih<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_113_113">[113]</a>?</p>
<p>He answered, I do not speak of what I can do, but of what I should
like to learn. At services in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand
Audience, I should like to fill a small part.</p>
<p>And what wouldst thou do, Tien<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_114_114">[114]</a>?</p>
<p>Tien stopped playing, pushed his still sounding lute aside, rose and
answered, My choice would be unlike those of the other three.</p>
<p>What harm in that? said the Master. Each but spake his mind.</p>
<p>In the last days of spring, all clad for the springtime, with five or
six young men and six or seven lads, I would bathe in the Yi, be
fanned by the wind in the Rain God's glade, and go back home singing.</p>
<p>The Master said with a sigh, I side with Tien.</p>
<p>Tseng Hsi stayed after the other three had left, and said, What did ye
think, Sir, of what the three disciples said?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p><p>Each but spake his mind, said the Master.</p>
<p>Why did ye smile at Yu,<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_115_115">[115]</a> Sir?</p>
<p>Lands are swayed by courtesy, but what he said was not modest. That
was why I smiled. Yet did not Ch'iu speak of a state? Where would
sixty or seventy, or fifty or sixty, square miles be found that are
not a state? And did not Ch'ih too speak of a state? Who but great
vassals are there in the Ancestral Temple, or at the Grand Audience?
But if Ch'ih were to take a small part, who could fill a big one?</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XII"></a>BOOK XII</h2>
<p>1. Yen Yüan asked, What is love?</p>
<p>The Master said, Love is to conquer self and turn to courtesy. If we
could conquer self and turn to courtesy for one day, all below heaven
would turn to love. Does love flow from within, or does it flow from
others?</p>
<p>Yen Yüan said, May I ask what are its signs?</p>
<p>The Master said, To be always courteous of eye and courteous of ear;
to be always courteous in word and courteous in deed.</p>
<p>Yen Yüan said, Though I am not clever, I hope to live by these words.</p>
<p>2. Chung-kung asked, What is love?</p>
<p>The Master said, Without the door to behave as though a great guest
were come; to treat the people as though we tendered the great
sacrifice; not to do unto others what we would not they should do unto
us; to breed no wrongs in the state and breed no wrongs in the home.</p>
<p>Chung-kung said, Though I am not clever, I hope to live by these
words.</p>
<p>3. Ssu-ma Niu<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_116_116">[116]</a> asked, What is love?</p>
<p>The Master said, Love is slow to speak.</p>
<p>To be slow to speak! Can that be called love?</p>
<p>The Master said, Can that which is hard to do be lightly spoken?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p><p>4. Ssu-ma Niu asked, What is a gentleman?</p>
<p>The Master said, A gentleman knows neither sorrow nor fear.</p>
<p>No sorrow and no fear! Can that be called a gentleman?</p>
<p>The Master said. He searches his heart: it is blameless; so why should
he sorrow, what should he fear?</p>
<p>5. Ssu-ma Niu cried sadly, All men have brothers, I alone have none!</p>
<p>Tzu-hsia said, I have heard that life and death are allotted, that
wealth and honours are in Heaven's hand. A gentleman is careful and
does not trip; he is humble towards others and courteous. All within
the four seas are brethren; how can a gentleman lament that he has
none?</p>
<p>6. Tzu-chang asked, What is insight?</p>
<p>The Master said, Not to be moved by lap and wash of slander, or by
plaints that pierce to the quick, may be called insight. Yea, whom lap
and wash of slander, or plaints that pierce to the quick cannot move
may be called far-sighted.</p>
<p>7. Tzu-kung asked, What is kingcraft?</p>
<p>The Master said, Food enough, troops enough, and the trust of the
people.</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, If it had to be done, which could best be spared of the
three?</p>
<p>Troops, said the Master.</p>
<p>And if we had to, which could better be spared of the other two?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>Food, said the Master. From of old all men die, but without trust a
people cannot stand.</p>
<p>8. Chi Tzu-ch'eng<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_117_117">[117]</a> said, It is the stuff alone that makes a
gentleman; what can art do for him?</p>
<p>Alas! my lord, said Tzu-kung, how ye speak of a gentleman! No team
overtakes the tongue! The art is no less than the stuff, the stuff is
no less than the art. Without the fur, a tiger or a leopard's hide is
no better than the hide of a dog or a goat.</p>
<p>9. Duke Ai said to Yu Jo,<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_118_118">[118]</a> In this year of dearth I have not
enough for my wants; what should be done?</p>
<p>Ye might tithe the people, answered Yu Jo.</p>
<p>A fifth is not enough, said the Duke, how could I do with a tenth?</p>
<p>When all his folk have enough, answered Yu Jo, shall the lord alone
not have enough? When none of his folk have enough, shall the lord
alone have enough?</p>
<p>10. Tzu-chang asked how to raise the mind and scatter delusions.</p>
<p>The Master said, Put faithfulness and truth first, and follow the
right; the mind will be raised. We wish life to what we love and death
to what we hate. To wish it both life and death is a delusion.</p>

<p>Confucius answered. For the lord to be lord and the liege, liege, the
father to be father and the son, son.</p>
<p>True indeed! said the Duke. If the lord were no lord and the liege no
liege, the father no father and the son no son, though the grain were
there, could I get anything to eat?</p>
<p>12. The Master said, To stint a quarrel with half a word Yu<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_120_120">[120]</a> is
the man.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu never slept over a promise.</p>
<p>13. The Master said, At hearing lawsuits I am no better than others.
What is needed is to stop lawsuits.</p>
<p>14. Tzu-chang asked, What is kingcraft?</p>
<p>The Master said, To be tireless of thought and faithful in doing.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, Breadth of reading and the ties of courtesy will
keep us, too, from false paths.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, A gentleman shapes the good in man, he does not
shape the bad in him. The small man does the contrary.</p>
<p>17. Chi K'ang<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_121_121">[121]</a> asked Confucius how to rule.</p>
<p>Confucius answered, To rule is to set straight. If ye give a straight
lead, Sir, who will dare not go straight?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p><p>18. Chi K'ang being troubled by robbers asked Confucius about it.</p>
<p>Confucius answered, If ye did not wish it, Sir, though ye rewarded him
no man would steal.</p>
<p>19. Chi K'ang, speaking of kingcraft to Confucius, said, To help those
that follow the Way, should we kill the men that will not?</p>
<p>Confucius answered, Sir, what need has a ruler to kill? If ye wished
for goodness, Sir, the people would be good. The gentleman's mind is
the wind, and grass are the minds of small men: as the wind blows, so
must the grass bend.</p>
<p>20. Tzu-chang asked, What must a knight be, for him to be called
eminent?</p>
<p>The Master said, What dost thou mean by eminence?</p>
<p>Tzu-chang answered, To be famous in the state and famous in his home.</p>
<p>That is fame, not eminence, said the Master. The eminent man is plain
and straight, and loves right. He weighs words and scans looks; he
takes pains to come down to men. And he shall be eminent in the state
and eminent in his house. The famous man wears a mask of love, but his
deeds belie it. Self-confident and free from doubts, fame will be his
in the state and fame be his in his home.</p>
<p>21. Whilst walking with the Master in the Rain God's glade Fan Ch'ih
said to him, May I ask how to raise the mind, amend evil and scatter
errors?</p>
<p>Well asked! said the Master. Rank thy work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> above success, will not
the mind be raised? Fight the bad in thee, not the bad in other men,
will not evil be mended? One angry morning to forget both self and
kin, is that no error?</p>
<p>22. Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?</p>
<p>The Master said, To love men.</p>
<p>He asked, What is wisdom?</p>
<p>The Master said, To know men.</p>
<p>Fan Ch'ih did not understand.</p>
<p>The Master said, Lift up the straight, put by the crooked, and crooked
men will grow straight.</p>
<p>Fan Ch'ih withdrew, and seeing Tzu-hsia, said to him, The Master saw
me and I asked him what wisdom is. He answered, Lift up the straight,
put by the crooked, and crooked men will grow straight. What did he
mean?</p>
<p>How rich a saying! said Tzu-hsia. When Shun<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_122_122">[122]</a> had all below heaven
he chose Kao-yao from the many, lifted him up, and the men without
love fled. When T'ang<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_123_123">[123]</a> had all below heaven, he chose Yi-yin<a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_124_124">[124]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>from the many, lifted him up, and the men without love fled.</p>
<p>23. Tzu-kung asked about friends.</p>
<p>The Master said, Talk faithfully to them, and guide them well. If this
is no good, stop. Do not bring shame upon thee.</p>
<p>24. Tseng-tzu said, A gentleman gathers friends by culture, and stays
love with friendship.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XIII"></a>BOOK XIII</h2>
<p>1. Tzu-lu asked how to rule.</p>
<p>The Master said, Go before; work hard.</p>
<p>When asked to say more, he said, Never flag.</p>
<p>2. When he was steward of the Chi, Chung-kung asked how to rule.</p>
<p>The Master said, Let officers act first; overlook small faults, lift
up brains and worth.</p>
<p>Chung-kung said, How shall I get to know brains and worth to lift them
up?</p>
<p>Lift up those thou dost know, said the Master; and those thou dost not
know, will other men pass by?</p>
<p>3. Tzu-lu said, The lord of Wei<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_125_125">[125]</a> waits for you, Sir, to govern.
How shall ye begin?</p>
<p>Surely, said the Master, by putting names right.</p>
<p>Indeed, said Tzu-lu, that is far-fetched, Sir. Why put them right?</p>
<p>What a savage Yu<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_126_126">[126]</a> is! said the Master. A gentleman is tongue-tied
when he does not understand. If names are not right, words do not fit.
If words do not fit, affairs go wrong. If affairs go wrong, neither
courtesy nor music thrive. If courtesy and music do not thrive, law
and justice fail. And if law and justice fail them, the people can
move neither hand nor foot. So a gentleman must be <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ready to put names
into speech and words into deed. A gentleman is nowise careless of his
words.</p>
<p>4. Fan Ch'ih asked to be taught husbandry.</p>
<p>The Master said. An old husbandman knows more than I do.</p>
<p>He asked to be taught gardening.</p>
<p>The Master said. An old gardener knows more than I do.</p>
<p>After Fan Ch'ih had gone, the Master said, How small a man! If those
above love courtesy, no one will dare to slight them; if they love
right, no one will dare to disobey; if they love truth, no one will
dare to hide the heart. Then, from the four corners of the earth, folk
will gather with their children on their backs; and what need will
there be for husbandry?</p>
<p>5. The Master said, Though a man have conned three hundred poems, if
he stands helpless when put to govern, if he cannot answer for himself
when he is sent to the four corners of the earth, many as they are,
what have they done for him?</p>
<p>6. The Master said, The man of upright life is obeyed before he
speaks; commands even go unheeded when the life is crooked.</p>
<p>7. The Master said, The governments of Lu and Wei are brothers.</p>
<p>8. Speaking of Ching, of the ducal house of Wei, the Master said, He
was wise in his private life. When he had begun to save, he said, This
seems enough. When he grew better off, he said, This seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> plenty.
When he had grown rich, he said. This seems splendour.</p>
<p>9. When Jan Yu was driving him to Wei, the Master said. What numbers!</p>
<p>Jan Yu said, Since numbers are here, what next is needed?</p>
<p>Wealth, said the Master.</p>
<p>And what comes next after wealth?</p>
<p>Teaching, said the Master.</p>
<p>10. The Master said, If I were employed for a twelve-month, much could
be done. In three years all would be ended.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, If good men were to govern a land for an hundred
years, cruelty would be conquered and putting to death done away with.
How true are these words!</p>
<p>12. The Master said, Even if a king were to govern, a lifetime would
pass before love dawned!</p>
<p>13. The Master said, What is governing to a man that can rule himself?
If he cannot rule himself, how shall he rule others?</p>
<p>14. As the disciple Jan<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_127_127">[127]</a> came back from court, the Master said to
him. Why so late?</p>
<p>I had business of state, he answered.</p>
<p>Household business, said the Master. If it had been business of state,
though I am out of office, I should have heard of it.</p>
<p>15. Duke Ting asked, Is there any one saying that can bless a kingdom?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p><p>Confucius answered, That is more than words can do. But men have a
saying, To be lord is hard and to be minister is not easy. And if one
knew how hard it is to be lord, might not this one saying almost bless
a kingdom?</p>
<p>And is there any one saying that can wreck a kingdom?</p>
<p>That is more than words can do, Confucius answered. But men have a
saying, My only delight in being lord is that no one withstands what I
say. Now if what he says is good, and no one withstands him, is not
that good too? But if it is not good, and no one withstands him, might
not this one saying almost wreck a kingdom?</p>
<p>16. The Duke of She asked, What is kingcraft?</p>
<p>The Master answered, For those near us to be happy and those far off
to come.</p>
<p>17. When he was governor of Chü-fu, Tzu-hsia asked how to rule.</p>
<p>The Master said, Be not eager for haste; look not for small gains.
Nothing done in haste is thorough, and looking for small gains big
things are left undone.</p>
<p>18. The Duke of She told Confucius, Among the upright men of my clan
if the father steals a sheep his son bears witness.</p>
<p>Confucius answered, Our clan's uprightness is unlike that. The father
screens his son and the son screens his father. There is uprightness
in this.</p>
<p>19. Fan Ch'ih asked, What is love?</p>
<p>The Master said, To be humble at home, earnest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> at work, and faithful
to all. Even among wild tribes none of this must be dropped.</p>
<p>20. Tzu-kung asked, What is it that we call knighthood?</p>
<p>The Master said, To be called a knight, a man must be shamefast in all
that he does, if he is sent to the four corners of the earth he must
not disgrace his lord's commands.</p>
<p>May I ask who would come next?</p>
<p>He that his clansmen call a good son and his neighbours call modest.</p>
<p>And who would come next?</p>
<p>A man that clings to his word and sticks to his course, a flinty
little fellow, would perhaps come next.</p>
<p>And how are the crown servants of to-day?</p>
<p>What! The weights and measures men! said the Master. Are they worth
reckoning?</p>
<p>21. The Master said, As I cannot get men of the middle way I have to
fall back on zealous and austere men. Zealous men push ahead and take
things up, and there are things that austere men will not do.</p>
<p>22. The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, 'Unless he is
stable a man will make neither a wizard nor a leech.' This is true.
'His instability of mind may disgrace him.'</p>
<p>The Master said, Neglect of the omens, that is all.</p>
<p>23. The Master said, Gentlemen unite, but are not the same. Small men
are all the same, but each for himself.</p>
<p>24. Tzu-kung said, If the whole countryside loved a man, how would
that be?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>It would not do, said the Master.</p>
<p>And how would it be, if the whole countryside hated him?</p>
<p>It would not do, said the Master. It would be better if all the good
men of the countryside loved him and all the bad men hated him.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, A gentleman is easy to serve and hard to please.
If we go from the Way to please him, he is not pleased; but his
commands are measured to the man. A small man is hard to serve and
easy to please. Though we go from the Way to please him, he is
pleased; but he expects everything of his men.</p>
<p>26. The Master said, A gentleman is high-minded, not proud; the small
man is proud, but not high-minded.</p>
<p>27. The Master said, Strength and courage, simplicity and modesty are
akin to love.</p>
<p>28. Tzu-lu asked, When can a man be called a knight?</p>
<p>The Master said, To be earnest, encouraging and kind may be called
knighthood: earnest and encouraging with his friends, and kind to his
brothers.</p>
<p>29. The Master said, If a good man taught the people for seven years,
they would be fit to bear arms too.</p>
<p>30. The Master said, To take untaught men to war is called throwing
them away.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XIV"></a>BOOK XIV</h2>
<p>1. Hsien<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_128_128">[128]</a> asked, What is shame?</p>
<p>The Master said, To draw pay when the land keeps the Way and to draw
pay when it has lost the Way, is shame.</p>
<p>2. To eschew strife and bragging, spite and greed, would that be love?</p>
<p>The Master said, That may be hard to do; but I do not know that it is
love.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, A knight that is fond of ease does not amount to a
knight.</p>
<p>4. The Master said, Whilst the land keeps the Way, be fearless of
speech and fearless in deed; when the land has lost the Way, be
fearless in deed but soft of speech.</p>
<p>5. The Master said, A man of mind can always talk, but talkers are not
always men of mind. Love is always bold, though boldness is found
without love.</p>
<p>6. Nan-kung Kuo said to Confucius, Yi<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_129_129">[129]</a> shot well, Ao pushed a boat
over land: each died before his time. Yü and Chi toiled at their
crops, and had all below heaven.</p>
<p>The Master did not answer. But when Nan-kung Kuo had gone, he said,
What a gentleman he is! How he honours mind!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p><p>7. The Master said, Alas! there have been gentlemen without love! But
there has never been a small man that was not wanting in love.</p>
<p>8. The Master said, Can he love thee that never tasks thee? Can he be
faithful that never chides?</p>
<p>9. The Master said, The decrees were drafted by P'i Shen, criticised
by Shih-shu, polished by the Foreign Minister Tzu-yü, and given the
final touches by Tzu-ch'an of Tung-li.</p>
<p>10. When he was asked what he thought of Tzu-ch'an, the Master said, A
kind-hearted man.</p>
<p>Asked what he thought of Tzu-hsi, the Master said, Of him! What I
think of him!</p>
<p>Asked what he thought of Kuan Chung,<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_130_130">[130]</a> the Master said, He was the
man that drove the Po from the town of Pien with its three hundred
households to end his days on coarse rice, without his muttering a
word.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, Not to grumble at being poor is hard, not to be
proud of wealth is easy.</p>
<p>12. The Master said, Meng Kung-ch'o is more than fit to be steward of
Chao or Wei, but he could not be minister of T'eng or Hsieh.</p>
<p>13. Tzu-lu asked what would make a full-grown man.</p>
<p>The Master said, The wisdom of Tsang Wu-chung, Kung-ch'o's lack of
greed, Chuang of Pien's boldness and the skill of Jan Ch'iu, graced by
courtesy and music, might make a full-grown man.</p>
<p>But now, he said, who asks the like of a full-grown <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>man? He that in
sight of gain thinks of right, who when danger looms stakes his life,
who, though the bond be old, does not forget what he has been saying
all his life, might make a full-grown man.</p>
<p>14. Speaking of Kung-shu Wen, the Master said to Kung-ming Chia, Is it
true that thy master does not speak, nor laugh, nor take a gift?</p>
<p>Kung-ming Chia answered, That is saying too much. My master only
speaks when the time comes, so no one tires of his speaking; he only
laughs when he is merry, so no one tires of his laughter; he only
takes when it is right to take, so no one tires of his taking.</p>
<p>It may be so, said the Master; but is it?</p>
<p>15. The Master said, When he held Fang and asked Lu to appoint an
heir, though Tsang Wu-chung said he was not forcing his lord, I do not
believe it.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Duke Wen of Chin was deep, but dishonest; Duke
Huan of Ch'i was honest, but shallow.</p>
<p>17. Tzu-lu said, When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, and Shao Hu
died with him, but Kuan Chung did not, was not this want of love?<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_131_131">[131]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p><p>The Master said, Duke Huan gathered the great vassals round him, not
by chariots of war, but through the might of Kuan Chung. What can love
do more? What can love do more?</p>
<p>18. Tzu-kung said, When Duke Huan slew the young duke Chiu, and Kuan
Chung could not face death and even became his minister, surely he
showed want of love?</p>
<p>The Master said, By Kuan Chung helping Duke Huan to put down the great
vassals and make all below heaven one, men have fared the better from
that day to this. But for Kuan Chung our hair would hang down our
backs and our coats would button to the left; or should he, like the
bumpkin and his lass, their troth to keep, have drowned in a ditch,
unknown to anyone?</p>
<p>19. The minister Hsien, who had been steward to Kung-shu Wen, went to
audience of the Duke together with Wen.</p>
<p>When the Master heard of it, he said, He is rightly called Wen
(well-bred).</p>
<p>20. The Master spake of Ling Duke of Wei's contempt for the Way.</p>
<p>K'ang<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_132_132">[132]</a> said, If this be so, how does he escape ruin?</p>
<p>Confucius answered, With Chung-shu Yü in charge of the guests, the
reader T'o in charge of the Ancestral Temple, and Wang-sun Chia in
charge of the troops, how should he come to ruin?</p>
<p>21. The Master said, When words are unblushing, they are hard to make
good.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p><p>22. Ch'en Ch'eng murdered Duke Chien.<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_133_133">[133]</a></p>
<p>Confucius bathed, and went to court and told Duke Ai, saying, Ch'en
Heng has murdered his lord: pray, punish him.</p>
<p>The Duke said, Tell the three chiefs.</p>
<p>Confucius said, As I follow in the wake of the ministers, I dared not
leave this untold; but the lord says, Tell the three chiefs.</p>
<p>He told the three chiefs. It did no good.</p>
<p>Confucius said, As I follow in the wake of the ministers, I dared not
leave this untold.</p>
<p>23. Tzu-lu asked how to serve a lord.</p>
<p>The Master said, Never cheat him; stand up to him.</p>
<p>24. The Master said, A gentleman's life leads upwards; the small man's
life leads down.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, The men of old learned for their own sake; to-day
men learn for show.</p>
<p>26. Ch'ü Po-yü sent a man to Confucius.</p>
<p>As they sat together, Confucius asked him, What does your master do?</p>
<p>He answered, My master wishes to make his faults fewer, but cannot.</p>
<p>When the messenger had left, the Master said, A messenger, a messenger
indeed!</p>
<p>27. The Master said, When not in office discuss not policy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p><p>28. Tseng-tzu said, Even in his thoughts, a gentleman does not outstep
his place.</p>
<p>29. The Master said, A gentleman is shamefast of speech: his deeds go
further.</p>
<p>30. The Master said, In the way of the gentleman there are three
things that I cannot achieve. Love is never troubled; wisdom has no
doubts; courage is without fear.</p>
<p>That is what ye say, Sir, said Tzu-kung.</p>
<p>31. Tzu-kung would liken this man to that.</p>
<p>The Master said, What talents Tz'u has! Now I have no time for this.</p>
<p>32. The Master said, Sorrow not at being unknown; sorrow for thine own
shortcomings.</p>
<p>33. The Master said, Not to expect to be cheated, nor to look for
falsehood, and yet to see them coming, shows worth in a man.</p>
<p>34. Wei-sheng Mou said to Confucius, How dost thou still find roosts
to roost on, Ch'iu, unless by wagging a glib tongue?</p>
<p>Confucius answered, I dare not wag a glib tongue; but I hate
stubbornness.</p>
<p>35. The Master said, A steed is not praised for his strength, but
praised for his mettle.</p>
<p>36. One said, To mete out good for evil, how were that?</p>
<p>And how would ye meet good? said the Master. Meet evil with justice;
meet good with good.</p>
<p>37. The Master said, Alas! no man knows me! Tzu-kung said, Why do ye
say, Sir, that no man knows you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>The Master said, Never murmuring against Heaven, nor finding fault
with men; learning from the lowest, cleaving the heights. I am known
but to one, but to Heaven.</p>
<p>38. Liao, the duke's uncle, spake ill of Tzu-lu to Chi-sun.<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_134_134">[134]</a></p>
<p>Tzu-fu Ching-po told this to Confucius, saying, My master's mind is
surely being led astray by the duke's uncle, but I have still the
strength to expose his body in the market-place.</p>
<p>The Master said, If the Way is to be kept, that is the Bidding, and if
the Way is to be lost, this is the Bidding. What can the duke's uncle
do against the Bidding?</p>
<p>39. The Master said, Men of worth flee the world; the next best flee
the land. Then come those that go at a look, then those that go at
words.</p>
<p>40. The Master said, Seven men did so.</p>
<p>41. Tzu-lu spent a night at Shih-men.</p>
<p>The gate-keeper asked him, Whence comest thou?</p>
<p>From Confucius, answered Tzu-lu.</p>
<p>The man that knows it is no good and yet must still be doing? said the
gate-keeper.</p>
<p>42. When the Master was chiming his sounding stones in Wei, a
basket-bearer said, as he passed the door, The heart is full that
chimes those stones! But then he said, For shame! What a tinkling
sound! If no one knows thee, have done!</p>

<span class="i0">Lift thy robe through the shallows!<br></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p><p>The Master said, Where there's a will, that is nowise hard.</p>
<p>43. Tzu-chang said, What does the Book mean by saying that
Kao-tsung<a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_135_135">[135]</a> in his mourning shed did not speak for three years?</p>
<p>Why pick out Kao-tsung? said the Master. The men of old were all thus.
For three years after their lord had died, the hundred officers did
each his duty and hearkened to the chief minister.</p>
<p>44. The Master said, When those above love courtesy, the people are
easy to lead.</p>
<p>45. Tzu-lu asked, What makes a gentleman?</p>
<p>The Master said, To be bent on becoming better.</p>
<p>Is that all? said Tzu-lu.</p>
<p>By becoming better to bring peace to men.</p>
<p>And is that all?</p>
<p>By becoming better to bring peace to all men, said the Master. Even
Yao and Shun were still struggling to become better, and so bring
peace to all men.</p>
<p>46. Yüan Jang awaited the Master squatting.</p>
<p>Unruly when young, unmentioned as man, undying when old, spells
good-for-nothing! said the Master, and he hit him on the leg with his
staff.</p>
<p>47. When a lad from the village of Ch'üeh was made messenger, someone
asked, saying, Is it because he is doing well?</p>
<p>The Master said, I have seen him sitting in a man's seat, and seen him
walking abreast of his elders. He does not try to do well: he wishes
to be quickly grown up.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XV"></a>BOOK XV</h2>
<p>1. Ling, Duke of Wei, asked Confucius about the line of battle.</p>
<p>Confucius answered. Of the ritual of dish and platter<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_136_136">[136]</a> I have
heard somewhat: I have not learnt warfare.</p>
<p>He left the next day.</p>
<p>In Ch'en grain ran out. His followers were too ill to rise. Tzu-lu
showed that he was put out.</p>
<p>Has a gentleman to face want too? he said.</p>
<p>Gentlemen have indeed to face want, said the Master. The small man,
when he is in want, runs to excess.</p>
<p>2. The Master said, Tz'u,<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_137_137">[137]</a> dost thou not take me for a man that
has learnt much and thought it over?</p>
<p>Yes, he answered: is it not so?</p>
<p>No, said the Master. I string all into one.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, Yu,<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_138_138">[138]</a> how few men know great-heartedness!</p>
<p>4. The Master said, To rule doing nothing, was what Shun did. For what
is there to do? Self-respect and to set the face to rule, is all.</p>
<p>5. Tzu-chang asked how to get on.</p>
<p>The Master said, Be faithful and true of word, plain and lowly in thy
walk; thou wilt get on even in tribal lands. If thy words be not
faithful and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>true, thy walk not plain and lowly, wilt thou get on
even in thine own town? Standing, see these words ranged before thee;
driving, see them written upon the yoke. Then thou wilt get on.</p>
<p>Tzu-chang wrote them on his girdle.</p>
<p>6. The Master said, Straight indeed was the historian Yü! Like an
arrow whilst the land kept the Way; and like an arrow when it lost the
Way! What a gentleman was Ch'ü Po-yü! Whilst the land kept the Way he
took office, and when the land had lost the Way he rolled himself up
in thought.</p>
<p>7. The Master said, Not to speak to him that has ears to hear is to
spill the man. To speak to a man without ears to hear is to spill thy
words. Wisdom spills neither man nor words.</p>
<p>8. The Master said, A high will, or a loving heart, will not seek life
at cost of love. To fulfil love they will kill the body.</p>
<p>9. Tzu-kung asked how to attain to love.</p>
<p>The Master said, A workman bent on good work must first sharpen his
tools. In the land that is thy home, serve those that are worthy among
the great and make friends with loving knights.</p>
<p>10. Yen Yüan asked how to rule a kingdom.</p>
<p>The Master said, Follow the Hsia seasons, drive in the chariot of Yin,
wear the head-dress of Chou, take for music the Shao and its dance.
Banish the strains of Cheng and flee men that are glib; for the
strains of Cheng are wanton and glib speakers are dangerous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>11. The Master said. Without thought for far off things, there shall
be trouble near at hand.</p>
<p>12. The Master said, All is ended! I have seen no one that loves mind
as he loves looks!</p>
<p>13. The Master said, Did not Tsang Wen filch his post? He knew the
worth of Liu-hsia Hui,<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_139_139">[139]</a> and did not stand by him.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, By asking much of self and little of other men
ill feeling is banished.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, Unless a man say, Would this do? Would that do? I
can do nothing for him.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, When all day long there is no talk of right, and
little wiles find favour, the company is in hard case.</p>
<p>17. The Master said, Right is the stuff of which a gentleman is made.
Done with courtesy, spoken with humility, rounded with truth, right
makes a gentleman.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, His shortcomings trouble a gentleman; to be
unknown does not trouble him.</p>
<p>19. The Master said, A gentleman fears that his name shall be no more
heard when life is done.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p><p>20. The Master said, A gentleman asks of himself, the small man asks
of others.</p>
<p>21. The Master said, A gentleman is firm, not quarrelsome; a friend,
not a partisan.</p>
<p>22. The Master said, A gentleman does not raise a man for his words,
nor spurn the speech for the man.</p>
<p>23. Tzu-kung said, Is there one word by which we may walk till life
ends?</p>
<p>The Master said, Fellow-feeling, perhaps. Do not do unto others what
thou wouldst not have done to thee.</p>
<p>24. The Master said, Of the men that I meet, whom do I cry down, whom
do I overpraise? Or, if I overpraise them, it is after testing them.
It was owing to this people that the three lines of kings went the
straight way.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, I have still known historians that would leave a
gap in their text, and men that would lend a horse to another to ride.
Now it is so no more.</p>
<p>26. The Master said, Cunning words confound the mind; petty impatience
confounds great projects.</p>
<p>27. The Master said, The hatred of the many must be looked into; the
love of the many must be looked into.</p>
<p>28. The Master said, The man can exalt the Way: it is not the Way that
exalts the man.</p>
<p>29. The Master said, The fault is to cleave to a fault.</p>
<p>30. The Master said, I have spent whole days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> without food and whole
nights without sleep, thinking, and gained nothing by it. Learning is
better.</p>
<p>31. The Master said, A gentleman thinks of the Way; he does not think
of food. Sow, and famine may follow; learn, and pay may come; but a
gentleman grieves for the Way; to be poor does not grieve him.</p>
<p>32. The Master said, What wisdom has got will be lost again, unless
love hold it fast. Wisdom to get and love to hold fast, without
dignity of bearing, will not be honoured among men. Wisdom to get,
love to hold fast and dignity of bearing, without courteous ways are
not enough.</p>
<p>33. The Master said, A gentleman has no small knowledge, but he can
carry out big things: the small man can carry out nothing big, but he
may be knowing in small things.</p>
<p>34. The Master said, Love is more to the people than fire and water. I
have seen men come to their death by fire and water: I have seen no
man that love brought to his death.</p>
<p>35. The Master said, When love is at stake yield not to an army.</p>
<p>36. The Master said, A gentleman is consistent, not changeless.</p>
<p>37. The Master said, A servant of the king honours his work, and puts
food after it.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XVI"></a>BOOK XVI</h2>
<p>1. The Chi was about to make war on Chuan-yü.<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_141_141">[141]</a></p>
<p>When Confucius saw Jan Yu and Chi-lu,<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_142_142">[142]</a> they said to him, The Chi
is going to deal with Chuan-yü.</p>
<p>Confucius said, After all, Ch'iu,<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_143_143">[143]</a> art thou not in the wrong? The
kings of old made Chuan-yü lord of Tung Meng.<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_144_144">[144]</a> Moreover, as
Chuan-yü is inside our borders it is the liege of the spirits of earth
and corn of our land; so how can ye make war upon it?</p>
<p>Jan Yu said, Our master wishes it. Tzu-lu and I, his two ministers, do
not, either of us, wish it.</p>
<p>Confucius said, Ch'iu, Chou Jen used to say, 'He that can put forth
his strength takes his place in the line; he that cannot stands back.'
Who would take to help him a man that is no stay in danger and no
support in falling? Moreover, what thou sayest is wrong. If a tiger or
a buffalo escapes from his pen, if tortoiseshell or jade is broken in
its case, who is to blame?</p>
<p>Jan Yu said, But Chuan-yü is now strong, and it is near to Pi<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_145_145">[145]</a>; if
it is not taken now, in days <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>to come it will bring sorrow on our sons
and grandsons.</p>
<p>Ch'iu, said Confucius, instead of saying 'I want it,' a gentleman
hates to plead that he needs must. I have heard that fewness of men
does not vex a king or a chief, but unlikeness of lot vexes him.
Poverty does not vex him, but want of peace vexes him. For if wealth
were even, no one would be poor. In harmony is number; peace prevents
a fall. Thus, if far off tribes will not submit, bring them in by
encouraging mind and art, and when they come in give them peace. But
now, when far off tribes will not submit, ye two, helpers of your
lord, cannot bring them in. The kingdom is split and falling, and ye
cannot save it. Yet inside our land ye plot to move spear and shield!
The sorrows of Chi's grandsons will not rise in Chuan-yü, I fear: they
will rise within the palace wall.</p>
<p>2. Confucius said, When the Way is kept below heaven, courtesy, music
and punitive wars flow from the Son of heaven. When the Way is lost
below heaven, courtesy, music and punitive wars flow from the great
vassals. When they flow from the great vassals they will rarely last
for ten generations. When they flow from the great ministers they will
rarely last for five generations. When underlings sway the country's
fate they will rarely last for three generations. When the Way is kept
below heaven power does not lie with the great ministers. When the Way
is kept below heaven common folk do not argue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>3. Confucius said, For five generations its income has passed from the
ducal house;<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_146_146">[146]</a> for four generations power has lain with the great
ministers: and humbled, therefore, are the sons and grandsons of the
three Huan.</p>
<p>4. Confucius said, There are three friends that help us, and three
that do us harm. The friends that help us are a straight friend, an
outspoken friend, and a friend that has heard much. The friends that
harm us are plausible friends, friends that like to flatter, and
friends with a glib tongue.</p>
<p>5. Confucius said, There are three delights that do good, and three
that do us harm. Those that do good are delight in dissecting good
form and music, delight in speaking of the good in men, and delight in
having many worthy friends. Those that do harm are proud delights,
delight in idle roving, and delight in the joys of the feast.</p>
<p>6. Confucius said. Men that wait upon lords fall into three mistakes.
To speak before the time has come is rashness. Not to speak when the
time has come is secrecy. To speak heedless of looks is blindness.</p>
<p>7. Confucius said, A gentleman has three things to guard against.</p>
<p>In the days of thy youth, ere thy strength is steady, beware of lust.
When manhood is reached, in the fulness of strength, beware of strife.
In old age, when thy strength is broken, beware of greed.</p>
<p>8. Confucius said, A gentleman holds three things <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>in awe. He is in
awe of the Bidding of Heaven; he is in awe of great men; and he is
awed by the words of the holy.</p>
<p>The small man knows not the Bidding of Heaven, and holds it not in
awe. He is saucy towards the great; he makes game of holy men's words.</p>
<p>9. Confucius said, The best men are born wise. Next come those that
grow wise by learning; then those that learn from toil. Those that do
not learn from toil are the lowest of the people.</p>
<p>10. Confucius said, A gentleman has nine aims. To see clearly; to
understand what he hears; to be warm in manner, dignified in bearing,
faithful of speech, keen at work; to ask when in doubt; in anger to
think of difficulties; and in sight of gain to think of right.</p>
<p>11. Confucius said, In sight of good to be filled with longing; to
look on evil as scalding to the touch: I have seen such men, I have
heard such words.</p>
<p>To live apart and search thy will; to achieve thy Way, by doing right:
I have heard these words, but I have seen no such men.</p>
<p>12. Ching, Duke of Ch'i, had a thousand teams of horses; but the
people, on his death day, found no good in him to praise. Po-yi<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_147_147">[147]</a>
and Shu-ch'i<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_148_148">[148]</a> starved at the foot of Shou-yang, and to this day
the people still praise them.</p>
<p>Is not this the clue to that?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p><p>13. Ch'en K'ang<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_149_149">[149]</a> asked Po-yü,<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_150_150">[150]</a> Apart from us, have ye heard
anything, Sir?</p>
<p>He answered, No: once as my father stood alone and I sped across the
hall, he said to me, Art thou learning poetry? I answered, No. He that
does not learn poetry, he said, has no hold on words. I withdrew and
learned poetry.</p>
<p>Another day, when he again stood alone and I sped across the hall, he
said to me, Art thou learning courtesy? I answered, No. He that does
not learn courtesy, he said, has no foothold. I withdrew and learned
courtesy. These two things I have heard.</p>
<p>Ch'en K'ang withdrew, and cried gladly, I asked one thing, and I get
three! I hear of poetry; I hear of courtesy; and I hear too that a
gentleman stands aloof from his son.</p>
<p>14. A king speaks of his wife as 'my wife.' She calls herself
'handmaid.' Her subjects speak of her as 'our lord's wife,' but when
they speak to foreigners, they say 'our little queen.' Foreigners
speak of her, too, as 'the lord's wife.'</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XVII"></a>BOOK XVII</h2>
<p>1. Yang Huo<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_151_151">[151]</a> wished to see Confucius. Confucius did not go to see
him. He sent Confucius a sucking pig. Confucius chose a time when he
was out, and went to thank him. They met on the road.</p>
<p>He said to Confucius, Come, let us speak together. To cherish a gem,
and undo the kingdom, can that be called love?</p>
<p>It cannot, said Confucius.</p>
<p>To love office, and miss the hour again and again, can that be called
wisdom?</p>
<p>It cannot, said Confucius.</p>
<p>The days and months go by; the years do not wait for us.</p>
<p>True, said Confucius; I must take office.</p>
<p>2. The Master said, Men are near to each other by nature; the lives
they lead sunder them.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change.</p>
<p>4. As the Master came to Wu-ch'eng<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_152_152">[152]</a> he heard sounds of lute and
song.</p>
<p>Why use an ox-knife to kill a fowl? said the Master, with a pleased
smile.</p>
<p>Tzu-yu answered, Master, once I heard you say, A gentleman that has
learnt the Way loves men; small folk that have learnt the Way are easy
to rule.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p><p>My two-three boys, said the Master, what Yen<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_153_153">[153]</a> says is true. I
spake before in play.</p>
<p>5. Kung-shan Fu-jao<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_154_154">[154]</a> held Pi in rebellion. He called the Master,
who wished to go.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said in displeasure. This cannot be! why must ye go to
Kung-shan?</p>
<p>The Master said, He calls me, and would that be all? Could I not make
an Eastern Chou<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_155_155">[155]</a> of him that uses me?</p>
<p>6. Tzu-chang asked Confucius what is love.</p>
<p>Confucius said, Love is to mete out five things to all below heaven.</p>
<p>May I ask what they are?</p>
<p>Modesty and bounty, said Confucius, truth, earnestness and kindness.
Modesty escapes insult: bounty wins the many; truth gains men's trust;
earnestness brings success; and kindness is enough to make men work.</p>
<p>7. Pi Hsi called the Master, who wished to go.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said, Master, I heard you say once, To men whose own life is
evil, no gentleman will go. Pi Hsi holds Chung-mou in rebellion; how
could ye go to him, Sir?</p>
<p>Yes, I said so, answered the Master. But is not a thing called hard
that cannot be ground thin; white, if steeping will not turn it black?
And am I a gourd? Can I hang without eating?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p><p>8. The Master said, Hast thou heard the six words, Yu,<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_156_156">[156]</a> and the
six they sink into?</p>
<p>He answered. No.</p>
<p>Sit down, and I shall tell thee. The thirst for love, without love of
learning, sinks into simpleness. Love of knowledge, without love of
learning, sinks into vanity. Love of truth, without love of learning,
sinks into cruelty. Love of straightness, without love of learning,
sinks into rudeness. Love of daring, without love of learning, sinks
into turbulence. Love of strength, without love of learning, sinks
into oddity.</p>
<p>9. The Master said, My little children, why do ye not learn poetry?
Poetry would ripen you; teach you insight, friendliness and
forbearance; show you how to serve your father at home; and teach your
lord abroad; and it would teach you the names of many birds and
beasts, plants and trees.</p>
<p>10. The Master said to Po-yü,<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_157_157">[157]</a> Hast thou done the Chou-nan and
Shao-nan?<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_158_158">[158]</a> He that has not done the Chou-nan and Shao-nan is like
a man standing with his face to the wall.</p>
<p>11. The Master said, 'Courtesy, courtesy,' is the cry; but are jade
and silk the whole of courtesy? 'Music, music,' is the cry; but are
bells and drums the whole of music?</p>
<p>12. The Master said, Fierce looks and weakness within are like the
small man, like the thief that breaks through or clambers over a wall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p><p>13. The Master said, The plain townsman is the bane of mind.</p>
<p>14. The Master said, To tell unto the dust all that we hear upon the
way is to lay waste the mind.</p>
<p>15. The Master said, How can we serve the king with a low fellow, who
is itching to get what he wants and trembling to lose what he has?
This trembling to lose what he has may lead him anywhere.</p>
<p>16. The Master said, Men of old had three failings, which have,
perhaps, died out to-day. Ambitious men of old were not nice; now they
are unprincipled. Stern men of old were hard; now they are
quarrelsome. Ignorant men of old were straight; now they are false.
That is all.</p>
<p>17. The Master said, Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found
with love.</p>
<p>18. The Master said, I hate the ousting of scarlet by purple. I hate
the strains of Cheng, confounders of sweet music. I hate a sharp
tongue, the ruin of kingdom and home.</p>
<p>19. The Master said, I wish no word were spoken!</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, Sir, if ye said no word, what could your little
children write?</p>
<p>The Master said, What are the words of Heaven? The four seasons pass,
the hundred things bear life. What are the words of Heaven?</p>
<p>20. Ju Pei wished to see Confucius. Confucius pleaded sickness; but,
as the messenger left his door, he took a lute and sang, so the
messenger should hear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>21. Tsai Wo<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_159_159">[159]</a> asked about mourning for three years. He thought that
one was enough.</p>
<p>If for three years gentlemen forsake courtesy, courtesy must suffer.
If for three years they forsake music, music must decay. The old grain
passes, the new grain sprouts, the round of woods for the fire-drill
is ended in one year.</p>
<p>The Master said, Feeding on rice, clad in brocade, couldst thou be at
rest?</p>
<p>I could, he answered.</p>
<p>Then do what gives thee rest. But a gentleman, when he is mourning,
has no taste for sweets and no ear for music; he cannot rest in his
home. So he gives these up. Now, they give thee rest; then keep them.</p>
<p>After Tsai Wo had gone, the Master said, Yü's<a id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_160_160">[160]</a> want of love! At
the age of three a child first leaves the arms of his father and
mother, and mourning lasts for three years everywhere below heaven.
But did Yü have for three years the love of his father and mother?</p>
<p>22. The Master said, It is hard indeed when a man eats his fill all
day, and has nothing to task the mind! Could he not play at chequers?
Even that were better.</p>
<p>23. Tzu-lu said, Do gentlemen honour daring?</p>
<p>They put right higher, said the Master. With daring and no sense of
right gentlemen turn rebels and small men turn robbers.</p>
<p>24. Tzu-kung said, Do gentlemen hate too?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p><p>They do, said the Master. They hate the sounding of evil deeds; they
hate men of low estate that slander those over them; they hate daring
without courtesy; they hate men that are stout and fearless, but
blind.</p>
<p>And Tz'u,<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_161_161">[161]</a> he said, dost thou hate too?</p>
<p>I hate those that take spying for wisdom, who take want of manners for
courage, and take tale-telling for honesty.</p>
<p>25. The Master said, Only maids and serving-lads are hard to train. If
we draw near to them, they get unruly; if we hold them off, they grow
spiteful.</p>
<p>26. The Master said, When a man of forty is hated, he will be so to
the end.</p>

cannot treat him as I do the Chi. I put him between Chi and Meng.</p>
<p>I am old, he said; I cannot use him.</p>
<p>Confucius left.</p>
<p>4. The men of Ch'i<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_167_167">[167]</a> sent a gift of music girls. Chi Huan accepted
them, and for three days no court was held.</p>
<p>Confucius left.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p><p>5. Chieh-yü, the mad-head of Ch'u, as he passed Confucius, sang,</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Phoenix, bright phoenix,<br></span>
<span class="i2">Thy glory is ended!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Think of to-morrow;<br></span>

<span class="i0">Up and away!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Court is today<br></span>
<span class="i2">With danger attended.<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>Confucius alighted, for he wished to speak with him: but he hurried
away, and he could not speak with him.</p>
<p>6. Ch'ang-chü and Chieh-ni were working in the fields. As Confucius
passed them, he sent Tzu-lu to ask for the ford.</p>
<p>Ch'ang-chü said, Who is that holding the reins?</p>
<p>He is K'ung Ch'iu, said Tzu-lu.</p>
<p>Is he K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?</p>
<p>Yes, said Tzu-lu.</p>
<p>He knows the ford, said Ch'ang-chü.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu asked Chieh-ni.</p>
<p>Who are ye, Sir? he answered.</p>
<p>I am Chung Yu.</p>
<p>The disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?</p>
<p>Yes, he answered.</p>
<p>All below heaven is seething and boiling, said Chieh-ni, who can
change it? How much better would it be to follow a knight that flees
the world than to follow a knight that flees persons!</p>
<p>And he went on hoeing without stop.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu went and told the Master, whose face fell.</p>
<p>Can I herd with birds and beasts? he said. Whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> but these men can I
take as fellows? And if the Way were kept by all below heaven, I
should not need to change them.</p>
<p>7. Tzu-lu, who was following behind, met an old man carrying a basket
on his staff.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu asked him, Have ye seen the Master, Sir?</p>
<p>The old man answered, Thy four limbs are idle, thou canst not sort the
five seeds: who is thy Master?</p>
<p>And he planted his staff, and weeded.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu stood and bowed.</p>
<p>He kept Tzu-lu for the night, killed a fowl, made millet, gave them
him to eat, and presented his two sons.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu left the next day, and told the Master.</p>
<p>The Master said, He is in hiding.</p>
<p>He sent Tzu-lu back to see him; but when he arrived he had gone.</p>
<p>Tzu-lu said, Not to take office is not right. If the ties of old and
young cannot be thrown off, how can he throw off the liege's duty to
his lord? He wishes to keep his life clean, but he is unsettling the
bonds between men. To discharge that duty a gentleman takes office,
though he knows beforehand that the Way will not be kept.</p>
<p>8. Po-yi, Shu-ch'i, Yü-chung, Yi-yi, Chu-chang, Liu-hsia Hui and
Shao-lien were men that hid from the world.</p>
<p>The Master said, Po-yi<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_168_168">[168]</a> and Shu-ch'i<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_169_169">[169]</a> did not bend the will or
shame the body.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p><p>We must say that Liu-hsia Hui<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_170_170">[170]</a> and Shao-lien bent the will and
shamed the body. Their words hit man's duty, their deeds hit our
hopes. This we can say and no more.</p>
<p>We may say that Yü-chung and Yi-yi lived hidden, but were free of
speech. Their lives were clean, their retreat was well weighed.</p>
<p>But I am unlike all of them: there is nothing I must, or must not, do.</p>
<p>9. Chih, the Great Music-master, went to Ch'i; Kan, the conductor at
the second meal, went to Ch'u; Liao, the conductor at the third meal,
went to Ts'ai; Chüeh, the conductor at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.
The drum master Fang-shu crossed the River; the tambourine master Wu
crossed the Han; Yang the second bandmaster and Hsiang, who played the
sounding stones, crossed the sea.</p>
<p>10. The Duke of Chou<a id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_171_171">[171]</a> said to the Duke of Lu,<a id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_172_172">[172]</a> A gentleman
does not forsake kinsmen, nor offend his great lieges by not using
them. He will not cast off an old friend unless he have big cause; he
does not ask everything of anyone.</p>
<p>11. Chou had eight knights: Po-ta and Po-kuo, Chung-tu and Chung-hu,
Shu-yeh and Shu-hsia, Chi-sui and Chi-kua.</p>

<h2><a id="BOOK_XIX"></a>BOOK XIX</h2>
<p>1. Tzu-chang said, The knight that stakes his life when he sees
danger, who in sight of gain thinks of right, and whose thoughts are
reverent at worship, and sad when he is in mourning, will do.</p>
<p>2. Tzu-hsia said, Goodness, clutched too narrowly; a belief in the Way
which is not honest; can they be said to be, or said not to be?</p>
<p>3. The disciples of Tzu-hsia asked Tzu-chang whom we should choose as
our companions.</p>
<p>Tzu-chang said. What does Tzu-hsia say?</p>
<p>They answered, Tzu-hsia says, If the men be well for thee, go with
them; if they be not well, push them off.</p>
<p>Tzu-chang said. This is not the same as what I had heard. A gentleman
honours worth and bears with the many. He applauds goodness and pities
weakness. If I were a man of great worth, what could I not bear with
in others? If I am without worth, men will push me off: why should I
push other men off?</p>
<p>4. Tzu-hsia said, Though there must be things worth seeing along small
ways, a gentleman does not follow them, for fear of being left at last
in the mire.</p>
<p>5. Tzu-hsia said, He that each day remembers his failings and each
month forgets nothing won may be said to love learning indeed!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>6. Tzu-hsia said, By wide learning and singleness of will, by keen
questions and home thinking we reach love.</p>
<p>7. Tzu-hsia said, To master the hundred trades, apprentices work in a
shop; by learning, a gentleman finds his way.</p>
<p>8. Tzu-hsia said, The small man must always gloss his faults.</p>
<p>9. Tzu-hsia said, A gentleman changes thrice. Looking up to him he
seems stern; as we draw near, he warms; but his speech, when we hear
it, is sharp.</p>
<p>10. Tzu-hsia said, Until they trust him, a gentleman lays no burdens
on his people. If they do not trust him, they will think it cruel.
Until they trust him, he does not chide them. Unless they trust him,
it will seem fault-finding.</p>
<p>11. Tzu-hsia said, If we keep within the bounds of honour, we can step
to and fro through propriety.</p>
<p>12. Tzu-yu said, The disciples, the little sons of Tzu-hsia, can
sprinkle and sweep, attend and answer, come in and go out; but what
can come of twigs without roots?</p>
<p>When Tzu-hsia heard this, he said, Yen Yu<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_173_173">[173]</a> is wrong. If we teach
one thing in the way of a gentleman first, shall we tire before
reaching the next? Thus plants and trees differ in size. Should the
way of a gentleman bewilder him? To learn it, first and last, none but
the holy are fit.</p>
<p>13. Tzu-hsia said, A servant of the crown should <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>give his spare
strength to learning. With his spare strength a scholar should serve
the crown.</p>
<p>14. Tzu-yu said, Mourning should stretch to grief, and stop there.</p>
<p>15. Tzu-yu said, Our friend Chang<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_174_174">[174]</a> can do hard things, but love is
not yet his.</p>
<p>16. Tseng-tzu said, Chang is so spacious, so lordly, that at his side
it is hard to do what love bids.</p>
<p>17. Tseng-tzu said, I have heard the Master say, Man never shows what
is in him unless it be in mourning those dear to him.</p>
<p>18. Tseng-tzu said, I have heard the Master say, In all else we may be
as good a son as Meng Chuang, but in not changing his father's
ministers, or his father's rule, he is hard to match.</p>
<p>19. The Meng<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_175_175">[175]</a> made Yang Fu<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_176_176">[176]</a> Chief Knight,<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_177_177">[177]</a> who spake to
Tseng-tzu about it.</p>
<p>Tseng-tzu said, Those above have lost their way, the people have long
been astray. When thou dost get at the truth, be moved to pity, not
puffed with joy.</p>
<p>20. Tzu-kung said, Chou<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_178_178">[178]</a> was not so very wicked! Thus a gentleman
hates to live in a hollow, down into which runs all that is foul below
heaven.</p>
<p>21. Tzu-kung said, A gentleman's faults are like the eating of sun or
moon.<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_179_179">[179]</a> All men see them, and when he mends all men look up to him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p><p>22. Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tzu-kung, From whom did Chung-ni<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_180_180">[180]</a>
learn?</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, The Way of Wen and Wu<a id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_181_181">[181]</a> has not fallen into ruin. It
lives in men: the big in big men, the small in small men. In none of
them is the Way of Wen and Wu missing. How should the Master not learn
it? What need had he for a set teacher?</p>
<p>23. In talk with the great men of the court Shu-sun Wu-shu<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_182_182">[182]</a> said,
Tzu-kung is worthier than Chung-ni.</p>
<p>Tzu-fu Ching-po told this to Tzu-kung.</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, This is like the palace wall. My wall reaches to the
shoulder: peeping over you see the good home within. The Master's wall
is several fathoms high: no one can see the beauty of the Ancestral
Temple and the wealth of its hundred officers, unless he gets in by
the gate. And if only a few men find the gate, may not my lord have
spoken the truth?</p>
<p>24. Shu-sun Wu-shu cried down Chung-ni.</p>
<p>Tzu-kung said, It is labour lost. Chung-ni cannot be cried down. The
greatness of other men is a hummock, over which we can still leap.
Chung-ni is the sun or moon, which no one can overleap. Though the man
were willing to kill himself, how could he hurt the sun or moon? That
he does not know his own measure would only be seen the better!</p>
<p>25. Ch'en Tzu-ch'in<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_183_183">[183]</a> said to Tzu-kung, Ye humble yourself, Sir. In
what is Chung-ni your better?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p><p>Tzu-kung said, By one word a gentleman shows wisdom, by one word want
of wisdom. Words must not be lightly spoken. No one can come up to the
Master, as heaven is not to be climbed by steps. If the Master had
power in a kingdom, or a clan, the saying would come true, 'What he
sets up stands; he shows the way and men go it, he brings peace and
they come, he stirs them and they are at one. Honoured in life, he is
mourned when dead!' Who can come up to him?</p>

<p>1. Yao said, Hail to thee, Shun! The count that Heaven is telling
falls on thee. Keep true hold of the centre. If there be stress or
want within the four seas, the gift of Heaven will pass for ever.</p>
<p>Shun laid the same commands on Yü.</p>
<p><i>T'ang</i> said, I, Thy little child Li, dare to offer this black steer,
and dare to proclaim before Thee, Almighty Lord, that I dare not
forgive sin, nor keep down Thy ministers. Search them, O Lord, in
Thine heart. If Our life be sinful, visit it not upon the ten thousand
homesteads. If the ten thousand homesteads sin, the sin is on Our
head.</p>
<p>Chou bestowed great gifts, and good men grew rich.</p>
<p>'Loving hearts are better than near kinsmen. All the people blame no
one but me.'<a id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_185_185">[185]</a></p>
<p>He saw to weights and measures, revised the laws, and brought back
broken officers. Order reigned everywhere. He revived ruined kingdoms
and restored fiefs that had fallen in. All hearts below heaven turned
to him. The people's food, burials and worship weighed most with him.
His bounty gained the many, his truth won the people's trust, his
earnestness brought success, his justice made men glad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p><p>2. Tzu-chang asked Confucius, How should men be governed?</p>
<p>The Master said, To govern men we must honour five fair things and
spurn four evil things.</p>
<p>Tzu-chang said, What are the five fair things?</p>
<p>The Master said, A gentleman is kind, but not wasteful; he burdens,
but he does not embitter; he is covetous, but not greedy; high-minded,
but not proud; stern, but not fierce.</p>
<p>Tzu-chang said, What is meant by kindness without waste?</p>
<p>The Master said, To further what furthers the people, is not that
kindness without waste? If burdens be sorted to strength, who will
grumble? To covet love and get love, is that greed? Few or many, small
or great, all is one to a gentleman: he dares not slight any man. Is
not this to be high-minded, but not proud? A gentleman straightens his
robe and cap, and settles his look. He is severe, and men look up to
him with awe. Is not this to be stern, but not fierce?</p>
<p>Tzu-chang said, What are the four evil things?</p>
<p>The Master said, To leave untaught and then kill is cruelty; not to
give warning and to expect things to be done is tyranny; to give
careless orders and be strict when the day comes is robbery; to be
stingy in rewarding men is littleness.</p>
<p>3. The Master said, He that does not know the Bidding cannot be a
gentleman. Not to know good form is to have no foothold. Not to know
words is to know nothing of men.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works

provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
