book i  hsio r





 



        chapter i  the master said is it not pleasant to learn

with a constant perseverance and application

         is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant

quarters

         is he not a man of complete virtue who feels no

discomposure though men may take no note of him







        chap ii  the philosopher yu said they are few who

being filial and fraternal are fond of offending against their

superiors there have been none who not liking to offend

against their superiors have been fond of stirring up confusion

         the superior man bends his attention to what is

radical











that being established all practical courses naturally grow up

filial piety and fraternal submission are they not the root of

all benevolent actions

        chap iii the master said fine words and an

insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue

        chap iv the philosopher tsang said i daily examine

myself on three points whether in transacting business for

others i may have been not faithful whether in intercourse

with friends i may have been not sincere whether i may

have not mastered and practised the instructions of my

teacher











        chap v the master said to rule a country of a thousand

chariots there must be reverent attention to business and

sincerity economy in expenditure and love for men and the

employment of the people at the proper seasons

        chap vi the master said a youth when at home

should be filial and abroad respectful to his elders he should

be earnest and truthful he should overflow in love to all and

cultivate the friendship of the good when he has time and

opportunity after the performance of these things he should

employ them in polite studies

        chap vii tszehsia said if a man withdraws his mind

from the love of beauty and applies it as sincerely to the love

of the virtuous if in serving his parents he can exert his

utmost strength











if in serving his prince he can devote his life if in his

intercourse with his friends his words are sincere although

men say that he has not learned i will certainly say that he

has

        chap viii  the master said if the scholar be not

grave he will not call forth any veneration and his learning

will not be solid

         hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles

         have no friends not equal to yourself

         when you have faults do not fear to abandon them

        chap ix the philosopher tsang said let there be a

careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents and let

them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of

sacrifice then the virtue of the people will resume its proper

excellence













chap x  tszechin asked tszekung saying when our

master comes to any country he does not fail to learn all about

its government does he ask his information or is it given to

him

courteous temperate and complaisant and thus he gets his

information the masters mode of asking information is it

not different from that of other men

propriety a natural ease is to be prized in the ways prescribed

by the ancient kings this is the excellent quality and in things

small and great we follow them

         yet it is not to be observed in all cases if one knowing

how such ease should be prized manifests it without

regulating it by the rules of propriety this likewise is not to be

done

        chap xiii the philosopher yu said when agreements

are made according to what is right what is spoken can be

made good when respect is shown according to what is proper

one keeps far from shame and disgrace when the parties upon

whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with he

can make them his guides and masters

        chap xiv the master said he who aims to be a man of

complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his

appetite nor











in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease he is

earnest in what he is doing and careful in his speech he

frequents the company of men of principle that he may be

rectified such a person may be said indeed to love to learn

        chap xv  tszekung said what do you pronounce

concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter and the rich

man who is not proud the master replied they will do but

they are not equal to him who though poor is yet cheerful

and to him who though rich loves the rules of propriety

         tszekung replied it is said in the book of poetry as

you cut and then file as you carve and then polish the

meaning is the same i apprehend as that which you have just

expressed

three hundred pieces but the design of them all may be

embraced in one sentence having no depraved thoughts

        chap iii  the master said if the people be led by

laws and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments

they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of

shame

         if they be led by virtue and uniformity sought to be

given them by the rules of propriety they will have the sense

of shame and moreover will become good

        chap iv  the master said at fifteen i had my mind

bent on learning

         at thirty i stood firm

         at forty i had no doubts

toil of them and if when the young have wine and food they

set them before their elders is this to be considered filial

piety

official emolument

         the master said hear much and put aside the points

of which you stand in doubt while you speak cautiously at the

same time of the others then you will afford few occasions

for blame see much and put aside the things which seem

perilous while you are cautious at the same time in carrying

the others into practice then you will have few occasions for

words and few occasions for repentance in his conduct he is in

the way to get emolument

        chap ii  the master said respectfulness without the

rules of propriety becomes laborious bustle carefulness

without the rules of propriety becomes timidity boldness

without the rules of propriety becomes insubordination

straightforwardness without the rules of propriety becomes

rudeness

preserved from meanness

        chap iii the philosopher tsang being ill he called to

him the disciples of his school and said uncover my feet

my little children

good

high rank should consider specially important that in his

deportment and manner he keep from violence and

heedlessness that in regulating his countenance he keep near

to sincerity and that in his words and tones he keep far from

lowness and impropriety as to such matters as attending to

the sacrificial vessels there are the proper officers for them















        chap v the philosopher tsang said gifted with ability

and yet putting questions to those who were not so possessed

of much and yet putting questions to those possessed of little

great can drive from his principles is such a man a superior

man he is a superior man indeed

        chap vii  the philosopher tsang said the officer

may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance

his burden is heavy and his course is long











         perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is

his to sustain is it not heavy only with death does his

course stop is it not long

        chap viii  the master said it is by the odes that the

who has learned for three years without coming to be good

        chap xiii  the master said with sincere faith he

perfecting the excellence of his course

         such an one will not enter a tottering state nor dwell

in a disorganized one when right principles of government

prevail in the kingdom he will show himself when they are

prostrated he will keep concealed

         when a country is wellgoverned poverty and a mean

condition are things to be ashamed of when a country is ill

governed riches and honour are things to be ashamed of

grand and only yao corresponded to it how vast was his

virtue the people could find no name for it

         how majestic was he in the works which he

accomplished how glorious in the elegant regulations which he

instituted

        chap xx  shun had five ministers and the empire was

wellgoverned

         king wu said i have ten able ministers

         confucius said is not the saying that talents are

difficult to find true only when the dynasties of tang and yu

met were they more abundant than in this of chau yet there

was a woman among them the able ministers were no more

than nine men











         king wan possessed two of the three parts of the

empire and with those he served the dynasty of yin the

virtue of the house of chau may be said to have reached the

highest point indeed

        chap xxi the master said i can find no flaw in the

character of yu he used himself coarse food and drink but

displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits his

ordinary garments were poor but he displayed the utmost

elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron he lived in a low mean

house but expended all his strength on the ditches and water

channels i can find nothing like a flaw in yu

prescribed by the rules of ceremony but now a silk one is

hall but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it that

is arrogant i continue to bow below the hall though i oppose

the common practice

predeterminations no obstinacy and no egoism

        chap v  the master was put in fear in kwang

         he said after the death of king wan was not the

cause of truth lodged here in me













         if heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish

then i a future mortal should not have got such a relation to

that cause while heaven does not let the cause of truth perish

what can the people of kwang do to me

        chap vi  a high officer asked tszekung saying may

we not say that your master is a sage how various is his

ability

         tszekung said certainly heaven has endowed him

unlimitedly he is about a sage and moreover his ability is

various

         the master heard of the conversation and said does

the high officer know me when i was young my condition

was low and therefore i acquired my ability in many things

but they were mean matters must the superior man have such

variety of ability he does not need variety of ability

         lao said the master said having no official

doctrines sighed and said i looked up to them and they

seemed to become more high i tried to penetrate them and

they seemed to become more firm i looked at them before me

and suddenly they seemed to be behind

         the master by orderly method skilfully leads men on

he enlarged my mind with learning and taught me the

restraints of propriety

         when i wish to give over the study of his doctrines i

cannot do so and having exerted all my ability there seems

something to stand right up before me but though i wish to

follow and lay hold of it i really find no way to do so

        chap xi  the master being very ill tszelu wished the

disciples to act as ministers to him

         during a remission of his illness he said long has the

conduct of yu been deceitful by pretending to have ministers

when i have them not whom should i impose upon should i

impose upon heaven







du 









         moreover than that i should die in the hands of

ministers is it not better that i should die in the hands of you

my disciples and though i may not get a great burial shall i

die upon the road

        chap xii tszekung said there is a beautiful gem here

        chap xviii the master said the prosecution of

learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a

mound if there want but one basket of earth to complete the

down the earth on the level ground though but one basketful

is thrown at a time the advancing with it is my own going

forward

but does not unfold their aim and assents to those but does

not reform his conduct i can really do nothing with him

forces of a large state may be carried off but the will of even a

common man cannot be taken from him















        chap xxvi  the master said dressed himself in a

tattered robe quilted with hemp yet standing by the side of

men dressed in furs and not ashamed ah it is yu who is

equal to this

         he dislikes none he covets nothing what can he do

but what is good

         tszelu kept continually repeating these words of the

ode when the master said those things are by no means

sufficient to constitute perfect excellence

        chap xxvii the master said when the year becomes

cold then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last

to lose their leaves

        chap xxviii the master said the wise are free from

perplexities the virtuous from anxiety and the bold from fear

        chap xxix the master said there are some with whom

we may study in common but we shall find them unable to go

along









with us to principles perhaps we may go on with them to

principles but we shall find them unable to get established in

those along with us or if we may get so established along with

them we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events

along with us

        chap xxx  how the flowers of the aspenplum flutter

and turn do i not think of you but your house is distant

         the master said it is the want of thought about it

how is it distant





book x heang tang











        chap i  confucius in his village looked simple and

sincere and as if he were not able to speak

         when he was in the princes ancestorial temple or in

the court he spoke minutely on every point but cautiously

        chap ii  when he was waiting at court in speaking

with the great officers of the lower grade he spake freely but

in a straightforward manner in speaking with those of the

higher grade he did so blandly but precisely

         when the ruler was present his manner displayed

respectful uneasiness it was grave but selfpossessed



 







        chap iii  when the prince called him to employ him

in the reception of a visitor his countenance appeared to

change and his legs to move forward with difficulty

         he inclined himself to the other officers among whom

he stood moving his left or right arm as their position

required but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind

evenly adjusted

         he hastened forward with his arms like the wings of a

bird

         when the guest had retired he would report to the

prince the visitor is not turning round any more

        chap iv  when he entered the palace gate he seemed

to bend his body as if it were not sufficient to admit him













         when he was standing he did not occupy the middle of

the gateway when he passed in or out he did not tread upon

the threshold

         when he was passing the vacant place of the prince

his countenance appeared to change and his legs to bend under

him and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter

them

         he ascended the reception hall holding up his robe

with both his hands and his body bent holding in his breath

also as if he dared not breathe

         when he came out from the audience as soon as he

had descended one step he began to relax his countenance and

had a satisfied look when he had got to the bottom of the

steps he advanced rapidly to his place with his arms like

wings and on occupying it his manner still showed respectful

uneasiness

        chap v  when he was carrying the scepter of his

ruler he seemed to bend his body as if he were not able to

bear its weight he did not hold it higher than the position of

the hands in making











a bow nor lower than their position in giving anything to

another his countenance seemed to change and look

apprehensive and he dragged his feet along as if they were

held by something to the ground

         in presenting the presents with which he was charged

he wore a placid appearance

         at his private audience he looked highly pleased

coarse or fine texture but he wore it displayed over an inner

garment

fawns fur one of white and over foxs fur one of yellow

as his body

         when staying at home he used thick furs of the fox or

the badger

         when he put off mourning he wore all the appendages

of the girdle

         his undergarment except when it was required to be

of the curtain shape was made of silk cut narrow above and

wide below

robes and presented himself at court

food and also to change the place where he commonly sat in

the apartment

        chap viii  he did not dislike to have his rice finely

cleaned nor to have his minced meat cut quite small

damp and turned sour nor fish or flesh which was gone he did

not eat what was discoloured or what was of a bad flavour nor

anything which was illcooked or was not in season

away to others when the prince sent him a gift of undressed

meat he would have it cooked and offer it to the spirits of his

ancestors when the prince sent him a gift of a living animal he

would keep it alive

         when he was in attendance on the prince and joining

in the entertainment the prince only sacrificed he first tasted

everything

state he asked about everything

        chap xv  when any of his friends died if he had no

relations who could be depended on for the necessary offices

flesh of sacrifice

        chap xvi  in bed he did not lie like a corpse at

home he did not put on any formal deportment

         when he saw any one in a mourning dress though it

of former times

now there is no one who loves to learn as he did

        chap vii  when yen yuan died yen lu begged the

carriage of the master to sell and get an outer shell for his sons

coffin

         the master said every one calls his son his son

whether he has talents or has not talents there was li when

he died he had a coffin but no outer shell i would not walk on

foot to get a shell for him because having followed in the rear

of the great officers it was not proper that i should walk on

foot

        chap viii when yen yuan died the master said alas

heaven is destroying me heaven is destroying me















        chap ix  when yen yuan died the master bewailed

him exceedingly and the disciples who were with him said

master your grief is excessive

         is it excessive said he

         if i am not to mourn bitterly for this man for whom

should i mourn

        chap x  when yen yuan died the disciples wished to

give him a great funeral and the master said you may not do

so

         the master said hui behaved towards me as his

father i have not been able to treat him as my son the fault is

not mine it belongs to you o disciples

        chap xi chi lu asked about serving the spirits of the

dead the master said while you are not able to serve men

ask about













death he was answered while you do not know life how can

you know about death

        chap xii  the disciple min was standing by his side

looking bland and precise tszelu looking bold and soldierly

zan yu and tszekung with a free and straightforward manner

         he said yu there he will not die a natural death

        chap xiii  some parties in lu were going to take

down and rebuild the long treasury

         min tszechien said suppose it were to be repaired

after its old style why must it be altered and made anew

         the master said this man seldom speaks when he

does he is sure to hit the point













        chap xiv  the master said what has the lute of yu to

do in my door

         the other disciples began not to respect tszelu the

master said yu has ascended to the hall though he has not yet

passed into the inner apartments

        chap xv  tszekung asked which of the two shih or

shang was the superior the master said shih goes beyond the

due mean and shang does not come up to it

         then said tszekung the superiority is with shih i

suppose

         the master said to go beyond is as wrong as to fall

short

        chap xvi  the head of the chi family was richer than

the duke of chau had been and yet chiu collected his imposts

for him and increased his wealth















         the master said he is no disciple of mine my little

are often correct

        chap xix tszechang asked what were the

characteristics of



ji









the good man the master said he does not tread in the

footsteps of others but moreover he does not enter the

chamber of the sage

        chap xx the master said if because a mans discourse

appears solid and sincere we allow him to be a good man is he

really a superior man or is his gravity only in appearance

        chap xxi tszelu asked whether he should immediately

carry into practice what he heard the master said there are

your father and elder brothers to be consulted why should

you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice

what you hear zan yu asked the same whether he should

immediately carry into practice what he heard and the master

answered immediately carry into practice what you hear

kunghsi hwa said yu asked whether he should carry

immediately into practice what he heard and you said there

are your father and elder brothers to be consulted chiu asked

whether he should immediately carry into practice what he

heard and you said carry it immediately into practice i

chih am perplexed and venture to ask you for an explanation

the master said chiu is retiring and slow therefore















i urged him forward yu has more than his own share of

energy therefore i kept him back

        chap xxii the master was put in fear in kwang and

yen yuan fell behind the master on his rejoining him said i

thought you had died hui replied while you were alive how

should i presume to die

        chap xxiii  chi tszezan asked whether chung yu and

zan chiu could be called great ministers

         the master said i thought you would ask about some

extraordinary individuals and you only ask about yu and chiu

         what is called a great minister is one who serves his

prince according to what is right and when he finds he cannot

do so retires

















         now as to yu and chiu they may be called ordinary

ministers

         tszezan said then they will always follow their

chief will they

         the master said in an act of parricide or regicide they

would not follow him

        chap xxiv  tszelu got tszekao appointed governor

of pi

         the master said you are injuring a mans son

         tszelu said there are there common people and

officers there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain

why must one read books before he can be considered to have

learned

         the master said it is on this account that i hate your

glibtongued people

        chap xxv  tszelu tsang hsi zan yu and kunghsi

hwa were sitting by the master

         he said to them though i am a day or so older than

you do not think of that













         from day to day you are saying we are not known

if some ruler were to know you what would you like to do

         tszelu hastily and lightly replied suppose the case of

a state of ten thousand chariots let it be straitened between

other large states let it be suffering from invading armies and

to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all

vegetables if i were intrusted with the government of it in

three years time i could make the people to be bold and to

recognise the rules of righteous conduct the master smiled at

him

         turning to yen yu he said chiu what are your

wishes chiu replied suppose a state of sixty or seventy li

square or one of fifty or sixty and let me have the government

of it in three years time i could make plenty to abound

among the people as to teaching them the principles of

propriety and music i must wait for the rise of a superior man

to do that













         what are your wishes chih said the master next to

kunghsi hwa chih replied i do not say that my ability

extends to these things but i should wish to learn them at the

services of the ancestral temple and at the audiences of the

princes with the sovereign i should like dressed in the dark

squaremade robe and the black linen cap to act as a small

assistant

         last of all the master asked tsang hsi tien what are

your wishes tien pausing as he was playing on his lute while

it was yet twanging laid the instrument aside and rose my

wishes he said are different from the cherished purposes of

these three gentlemen what harm is there in that said the

master do you also as well as they speak out your wishes

tien then said in this the last month of spring with the dress

of the season all complete along with five or six young men

who have assumed the cap and six or seven boys i would

wash in the i enjoy the breeze among the rain altars and

return home singing the master heaved a sigh and said i

give my approval to tien













         the three others having gone out tsang hsi remained

behind and said what do you think of the words of these

three friends the master replied they simply told each one

his wishes

         hsi pursued master why did you smile at yu

         he was answered the management of a state

demands the rules of propriety his words were not humble

therefore i smiled at him

         hsi again said but was it not a state which chiu

proposed for himself the reply was yes did you ever see a

territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty which

was not a state

         once more hsi inquired and was it not a state which

chih proposed for himself the master again replied yes who

but princes have to do with ancestral temples and with

audiences but the sovereign if chih were to be a small

assistant in these services who could be a great one





book xii yen yuan









        chap i  yen yuan asked about perfect virtue the

master said to subdue ones self and return to propriety is

perfect virtue if a man can for one day subdue himself and

return to propriety all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue

to him is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself or

is it from others

         yen yuan said i beg to ask the steps of that process

the master replied look not at what is contrary to propriety

listen not to what is contrary to propriety speak not what is

contrary to propriety make no movement which is contrary to

propriety yen yuan then said though i am deficient in

intelligence and vigour i will make it my business to practise

this lesson









        chap ii chungkung asked about perfect virtue the

master said it is when you go abroad to behave to every one

as if you were receiving a great guest to employ the people as

if you were assisting at a great sacrifice not to do to others as

you would not wish done to yourself to have no murmuring

against you in the country and none in the family chungkung

said though i am deficient in intelligence and vigour i will

make it my business to practise this lesson

        chap iii  szema niu asked about perfect virtue

         the master said the man of perfect virtue is cautious

and slow in his speech













         cautious and slow in his speech said niu is this

what is meant by perfect virtue the master said when a

man feels the difficulty of doing can he be other than cautious

and slow in speaking

        chap iv  szema niu asked about the superior man

the master said the superior man has neither anxiety nor

fear

         being without anxiety or fear said nui does this

constitute what we call the superior man

         the master said when internal examination discovers

nothing wrong what is there to be anxious about what is there

to fear

        chap v  szema niu full of anxiety said other men

all have their brothers i only have not

         tszehsia said to him there is the following saying

which i have heard











         death and life have their determined appointment

riches and honours depend upon heaven

         let the superior man never fail reverentially to order

his own conduct and let him be respectful to others and

observant of propriety then all within the four seas will be

his brothers what has the superior man to do with being

distressed because he has no brothers

        chap vi tszechang asked what constituted intelligence

the master said he with whom neither slander that gradually

soaks into the mind nor statements that startle like a wound in

the flesh are successful may be called intelligent indeed yea

he with whom neither soaking slander nor startling

statements are successful may be called farseeing











        chap vii  tszekung asked about government the

master said the requisites of government are that there be

sufficiency of food sufficiency of military equipment and the

confidence of the people in their ruler

         tszekung said if it cannot be helped and one of

these must be dispensed with which of the three should be

foregone first the military equipment said the master

         tszekung again asked if it cannot be helped and one

of the remaining two must be dispensed with which of them

should be foregone the master answered part with the food

from of old death has been the lot of all men but if the people

have no faith in their rulers there is no standing for the state

        chap viii  chi tszechang said in a superior man it

is only the substantial qualities which are wanted why

should we seek for ornamental accomplishments





kuo kuo 







         tszekung said alas your words sir show you to be a

superior man but four horses cannot overtake the tongue

         ornament is as substance substance is as ornament

the hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair is like the

hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair

        chap ix  the duke ai inquired of yu zo saying the

year is one of scarcity and the returns for expenditure are not

sufficient what is to be done

         yu zo replied to him why not simply tithe the

people

         with two tenths said the duke i find it not enough

how could i do with that system of one tenth

         yu zo answered if the people have plenty their prince

will not be left to want alone if the people are in want their

prince cannot enjoy plenty alone















        chap x  tszechang having asked how virtue was to

be exalted and delusions to be discovered the master said

hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles and be

moving continually to what is right this is the way to exalt

ones virtue

         you love a man and wish him to live you hate him and

wish him to die having wished him to live you also wish him

to die this is a case of delusion

         it may not be on account of her being rich yet you

come to make a difference

        chap xi  the duke ching of chi asked confucius

about government

         confucius replied there is government when the

prince is prince and the minister is minister when the father

is father and the son is son

         good said the duke if indeed the prince be not

prince the minister not minister the father not father and the

son not son although i have my revenue can i enjoy it













        chap xii  the master said ah it is yu who could

with half a word settle litigations

         tszelu never slept over a promise

        chap xiii the master said in hearing litigations i am

like any other body what is necessary however is to cause

the people to have no litigations

        chap xiv tszechang asked about government the

master said the art of governing is to keep its affairs before

the mind without weariness and to practise them with

undeviating consistency

        chap xv the master said by extensively studying all

learning and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules

of propriety one may thus likewise not err from what is right











        chap xvi the master said the superior man seeks to

perfect the admirable qualities of men and does not seek to

perfect their bad qualities the mean man does the opposite of

this

        chap xvii chi kang asked confucius about government

confucius replied to govern means to rectify if you lead on

the people with correctness who will dare not to be correct

        chap xviii chi kang distressed about the number of

thieves in the state inquired of confucius how to do away with

them confucius said if you sir were not covetous although

you should reward them to do it they would not steal

        chap xix chi kang asked confucius about government

saying what do you say to killing the unprincipled for the

good of the principled confucius replied sir in carrying on

your government why should you use killing at all let your

evinced desires be for what is good and the people will be

good the relation















between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind

and the grass the grass must bend when the wind blows

across it

        chap xx  tszechang asked what must the officer be

who may be said to be distinguished

         the master said what is it you call being

distinguished

         tszechang replied it is to be heard of through the

state to be heard of throughout his clan

         the master said that is notoriety not distinction

         now the man of distinction is solid and

straightforward and loves righteousness he examines peoples

words and looks at their countenances he is anxious to humble

himself to others such a man will be distinguished in the

country he will be distinguished in his clan

         as to the man of notoriety he assumes the appearance

of













virtue but his actions are opposed to it and he rests in this

character without any doubts about himself such a man will be

heard of in the country he will be heard of in the clan

        chap xxi  fan chih rambling with the master under

the trees about the rain altars said i venture to ask how to

exalt virtue to correct cherished evil and to discover

delusions

         the master said truly a good question

         if doing what is to be done be made the first business

and success a secondary consideration is not this the way to

exalt virtue to assail ones own wickedness and not assail that

of others is not this the way to correct cherished evil for a

mornings anger to disregard ones own life and involve that of

his parents is not this a case of delusion

        chap xxii  fan chih asked about benevolence the

master said it is to love all men he asked about knowledge

the master said it is to know all men















         fan chih did not immediately understand these

answers

         the master said employ the upright and put aside all

the crooked in this way the crooked can be made to be

upright

         fan chih retired and seeing tszehsia he said to him

a little while ago i had an interview with our master and

asked him about knowledge he said employ the upright and

put aside all the crooked in this way the crooked will be

made to be upright what did he mean

         tszehsia said truly rich is his saying

         shun being in possession of the kingdom selected

from among all the people and employed kaoyao on which all

who were devoid of virtue disappeared tang being in

possession of the kingdom selected from among all the people

and employed i yin and all who were devoid of virtue

disappeared

        chap xxiii tszekung asked about friendship the

master said faithfully admonish your friend and skillfully

lead him on if you find him impracticable stop do not

disgrace yourself







        chap xxiv the philosopher tsang said the superior

man on grounds of culture meets with his friends and by their

friendship helps his virtue





book xiii tszelu









        chap i  tszelu asked about government the master

said go before the people with your example and be laborious

in their affairs

         he requested further instruction and was answered

be not weary in these things

        chap ii  chungkung being chief minister to the head

of the chi family asked about government the master said

employ













first the services of your various officers pardon small faults

and raise to office men of virtue and talents

         chungkung said how shall i know the men of virtue

and talent so that i may raise them to office he was

answered raise to office those whom you know as to those

whom you do not know will others neglect them

        chap iii  tszelu said the ruler of wei has been

waiting for you in order with you to administer the

government what will you consider the first thing to be done

         the master replied what is necessary is to rectify

names

         so indeed said tszelu you are wide of the mark

why must there be such rectification

         the master said how uncultivated you are yu a

superior man in regard to what he does not know shows a

cautious reserve

         if names be not correct language is not in accordance

with











the truth of things if language be not in accordance with the

truth of things affairs cannot be carried on to success

         when affairs cannot be carried on to success

proprieties and music will not flourish when proprieties and

music do not flourish punishments will not be properly

awarded when punishments are not properly awarded the

people do not know how to move hand or foot

         therefore a superior man considers it necessary that

the names he uses may be spoken appropriately and also that

what he speaks may be carried out appropriately what the

superior man requires is just that in his words there may be

nothing incorrect

        chap iv  fan chih requested to be taught husbandry

the master said i am not so good for that as an old

husbandman he













requested also to be taught gardening and was answered i am

not so good for that as an old gardener

         fan chih having gone out the master said a small

man indeed is fan hsu

         if a superior love propriety the people will not dare

not to be reverent if he love righteousness the people will not

dare not to submit to his example if he love good faith the

people will not dare not to be sincere now when these things

obtain the people from all quarters will come to him bearing

their children on their backs what need has he of a

knowledge of husbandry

        chap v the master said though a man may be able to

recite the three hundred odes yet if when intrusted with a

governmental charge he knows not how to act or if when sent

to any quarter on a mission he cannot give his replies

unassisted notwithstanding the extent of his learning of what

practical use is it















        chap vi the master said when a princes personal

conduct is correct his government is effective without the

issuing of orders if his personal conduct is not correct he may

issue orders but they will not be followed

        chap vii the master said the governments of lu and

wei are brothers

        chap viii the master said of ching a scion of the ducal

family of wei that he knew the economy of a family well

when he began to have means he said ha here is a

collection when they were a little increased he said ha this

is complete when he had become rich he said ha this is

admirable

        chap ix  when the master went to wei zan yu acted

as driver of his carriage

         the master observed how numerous are the people

         yu said since they are thus numerous what more

shall be done for them enrich them was the reply





 ji





         and when they have been enriched what more shall

be done the master said teach them

        chap x the master said if there were any of the

princes who would employ me in the course of twelve

months i should have done something considerable in three

years the government would be perfected

        chap xi the master said if good men were to govern a

country in succession for a hundred years they would be able

to transform the violently bad and dispense with capital

punishments true indeed is this saying

        chap xii the master said if a truly royal ruler were to

arise it would still require a generation and then virtue would

prevail















        chap xiii the master said if a minister make his own

conduct correct what difficulty will he have in assisting in

government if he cannot rectify himself what has he to do

with rectifying others

        chap xiv the disciple zan returning from the court the

master said to him how are you so late he replied we had

government business the master said it must have been

family affairs if there had been government business though i

am not now in office i should have been consulted about it

        chap xv  the duke ting asked whether there was a

single sentence which could make a country prosperous

confucius replied such an effect cannot be expected from one

sentence













         there is a saying however which people have to

be a prince is difficult to be a minister is not easy

         if a ruler knows this the difficulty of being a

prince may there not be expected from this one sentence the

prosperity of his country

         the duke then said is there a single sentence which

can ruin a country confucius replied such an effect as that

cannot be expected from one sentence there is however the

saying which people have i have no pleasure in being a

prince but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what

i say

         if a rulers words be good is it not also good that no

one oppose them but if they are not good and no one opposes

them may there not be expected from this one sentence the

ruin of his country

        chap xvi  the duke of sheh asked about government

         the master said good government obtains when those

who are near are made happy and those who are far off are

attracted













        chap xvii tszehsia being governor of chufu asked

about government the master said do not be desirous to have

things done quickly do not look at small advantages desire to

have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly

looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being

accomplished

        chap xviii  the duke of sheh informed confucius

saying among us here there are those who may be styled

upright in their conduct if their father have stolen a sheep

they will bear witness to the fact

         confucius said among us in our part of the country

those who are upright are different from this the father

conceals the misconduct of the son and the son conceals the

misconduct of the father uprightness is to be found in this













        chap xix fan chih asked about perfect virtue the

master said it is in retirement to be sedately grave in the

management of business to be reverently attentive in

intercourse with others to be strictly sincere though a man go

among rude uncultivated tribes these qualities may not be

neglected

        chap xx  tszekung asked saying what qualities

must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer the

master said he who in his conduct of himself maintains a

sense of shame and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace

his princes commission deserves to be called an officer

         tszekung pursued i venture to ask who may be

placed in the next lower rank and he was told he whom the

circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial whom his fellow

villagers and neighbours pronounce to be fraternal

         again the disciple asked i venture to ask about the

class still next in order the master said they are determined

to be sincere in what they say and to carry out what they do

they are obstinate little men yet perhaps they may make the

next class















         tszekung finally inquired of what sort are those of

the present day who engage in government the master said

pooh they are so many pecks and hampers not worth being

taken into account

        chap xxi the master said since i cannot get men

pursuing the due medium to whom i might communicate my

instructions i must find the ardent and the cautiouslydecided

the ardent will advance and lay hold of truth the cautiously

decided will keep themselves from what is wrong

        chap xxii  the master said the people of the south

have a saying a man without constancy cannot be either a

wizard or a doctor good

         inconstant in his virtue he will be visited with

disgrace













         the master said this arises simply from not attending

to the prognostication

        chap xxiii the master said the superior man is

affable but not adulatory the mean man is adulatory but not

affable

        chap xxiv tszekung asked saying what do you say

of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood

the master replied we may not for that accord our approval

of him and what do you say of him who is hated by all the

people of his neighborhood the master said we may not for

that conclude that he is bad it is better than either of these

cases that the good in the neighborhood love him and the bad

hate him

        chap xxv the master said the superior man is easy to

serve and difficult to please if you try to please him in any

way which is not accordant with right he will not be pleased

but in his















employment of men he uses them according to their capacity

the mean man is difficult to serve and easy to please if you

try to please him though it be in a way which is not accordant

with right he may be pleased but in his employment of men

he wishes them to be equal to everything

        chap xxvi the master said the superior man has a

dignified ease without pride the mean man has pride without

a dignified ease

        chap xxvii the master said the firm the enduring

the simple and the modest are near to virtue

        chap xxviii tszelu asked saying what qualities must

a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar the master

said he must be thus earnest urgent and bland among

his friends earnest and urgent among his brethren bland







        chap xxix the master said let a good man teach the

people seven years and they may then likewise be employed

in war

        chap xxx the master said to lead an uninstructed

people to war is to throw them away





book xiv hsien wan





        chap i hsien asked what was shameful the master

said when good government prevails in a state to be thinking

only of salary and when bad government prevails to be

thinking in the same way only of salary this is shameful















        chap ii  when the love of superiority boasting

resentments and covetousness are repressed this may be

deemed perfect virtue

         the master said this may be regarded as the

achievement of what is difficult but i do not know that it is to

be deemed perfect virtue

        chap iii the master said the scholar who cherishes

the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar

        chap iv the master said when good government

prevails in a state language may be lofty and bold and actions

the same when bad government prevails the actions may be

lofty and bold but the language may be with some reserve

        chap v the master said the virtuous will be sure to

speak correctly but those whose speech is good may not

always be virtuous men of principle are sure to be bold but

those who are bold may not always be men of principle









        chap vi nankung kwo submitting an inquiry to

confucius said i was skillful at archery and ao could move a

boat along upon the land but neither of them died a natural

death yu and chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry

and they became possessors of the kingdom the master made

no reply but when nankung kwo went out he said a

superior man indeed is this an esteemer of virtue indeed is

this

        chap vii the master said superior men and yet not

always virtuous there have been alas but there never has

been a mean man and at the same time virtuous













        chap viii the master said can there be love which

does not lead to strictness with its object can there be loyalty

which does not lead to the instruction of its object

        chap ix the master said in preparing the

governmental notifications pi shan first made the rough

draught shishu examined and discussed its contents tszeyu

the manager of foreign intercourse then polished the style

and finally tszechan of tungli gave it the proper elegance

and finish

        chap x  some one asked about tszechan the master

said he was a kind man

         he asked about tszehsi the master said that man

that man

         he asked about kwan chung for him said the master

the city of pien with three hundred families was taken from

word though to the end of his life he had only coarse rice to

eat















        chap xi the master said to be poor without

murmuring is difficult to be rich without being proud is easy

        chap xii the master said mang kungcho is more than

fit to be chief officer in the families of chao and wei but he is

not fit to be great officer to either of the states tang or hsieh

        chap xiii  tszelu asked what constituted a

complete man the master said suppose a man with the

knowledge of tsang wuchung the freedom from covetousness

of kungcho the bravery of chwang of pien and the varied

talents of zan chiu add to these the accomplishments of the

rules of propriety and music such a one might be reckoned a

complete man

         he then added but what is the necessity for a

complete man of the present day to have all these things the

man who in the











view of gain thinks of righteousness who in the view of

danger is prepared to give up his life and who does not forget

an old agreement however far back it extends such a man

may be reckoned a complete man

        chap xiv  the master asked kungming chia about

kungshu wan saying is it true that your master speaks not

laughs not and takes not

         kungming chia replied this has arisen from the

reporters going beyond the truth my master speaks when it

is the time to speak and so men do not get tired of his

speaking he laughs when there is occasion to be joyful and so

men do not get tired of his laughing he takes when it is

consistent with righteousness to do so and so men do not get

tired of his taking the master said so but is it so with him









        chap xv the master said tsang wuchung keeping

possession of fang asked of the duke of lu to appoint a

successor to him in his family although it may be said that he

was not using force with his sovereign i believe he was

crafty and not upright the duke hwan of chi was upright and

not crafty

        chap xvii  tszelu said the duke hwan caused his

brother chiu to be killed when shao hu died with his master

but kwan chung did not die may not i say that he was wanting

in virtue

his

to the duke hwan made him leader of all the princes and

united and rectified the whole kingdom down to the present

day the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred but for

kwan chung we should now be wearing our hair unbound and

shu says that kaotsung while observing the usual imperial

mourning was for three years without speaking

vessels but i have not learned military matters on this he

took his departure the next day

         when he was in chan their provisions were exhausted

and his followers became so ill that they were unable to rise

his words be











not sincere and truthful and his actions not honourable and

careful will he with such conduct be appreciated even in his

neighborhood

         when he is standing let him see those two things as it

attached to the yoke then may he subsequently carry them

into practice

        chap xxiv  the master said in my dealings with

men whose evil do i blame whose goodness do i praise

beyond what is proper if i do sometimes exceed in praise

individual

         this people supplied the ground why the three

        chap xxviii the master said a man can enlarge the

principles which he follows those principles do not enlarge the

man

        chap xxix the master said to have faults and not to

reform them this indeed should be pronounced having

faults

        chap xxx the master said i have been the whole day















without eating and the whole night without sleeping

occupied with thinking it was of no use the better plan is to

learn

        chap xxxi the master said the object of the superior

man is truth food is not his object there is plowing even in

that there is sometimes want so with learning emolument

may be found in it the superior man is anxious lest he should

not get truth he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon

him

        chap xxxii  the master said when a mans

knowledge is sufficient to attain and his virtue is not sufficient

to enable him to hold whatever he may have gained he will

lose again

         when his knowledge is sufficient to attain and he has

virtue enough to hold fast if he cannot govern with dignity the

people will not respect him

         when his knowledge is sufficient to attain and he has

virtue enough to hold fast when he governs also with dignity

yet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of

propriety full excellence is not reached











        chap xxxiii the master said the superior man cannot

be known in little matters but he may be intrusted with great

concerns the small man may not be intrusted with great

concerns but he may be known in little matters

        chap xxxiv the master said virtue is more to man

than either water or fire i have seen men die from treading on

water and fire but i have never seen a man die from treading

the course of virtue

        chap xxxv the master said let every man consider

virtue as what devolves on himself he may not yield the

performance of it even to his teacher















        chap xxxvi the master said the superior man is

correctly firm and not firm merely

        chap xxxvii the master said a minister in serving his

prince reverently discharges his duties and makes his

emolument a secondary consideration

        chap xxxviii the master said in teaching there

should be no distinction of classes

        chap xxxix the master said those whose courses are

different cannot lay plans for one another

        chap xl the master said in language it is simply

required that it convey the meaning

        chap xli  the musicmaster mien having called upon

him when they came to the steps the master said here are

the steps when they came to the mat for the guest to sit upon

he







said here is the mat when all were seated the master

informed him saying so and so is here so and so is here

         the musicmaster mien having gone out tszechang

asked saying is it the rule to tell those things to the music

master

         the master said yes this is certainly the rule for

those who lead the blind





book xvi ke she







        chap i  the head of the chi family was going to attack

chwanyu

         zan yu and chilu had an interview with confucius and

said our chief chi is going to commence operations against

chwanyu













         confucius said chiu is it not you who are in fault

here

         now in regard to chwanyu long ago a former king

appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern

mang moreover it is in the midst of the territory of our state

and its ruler is a minister in direct connexion with the

sovereign what has your chief to do with attacking it

         zan yu said our master wishes the thing neither of us

two ministers wishes it

         confucius said chiu there are the words of chau

zan when he can put forth his ability he takes his place in

the ranks of office when he finds himself unable to do so he

retires from it how can he be used as a guide to a blind man

who does not support him when tottering nor raise him up

when fallen

         and further you speak wrongly when a tiger or

rhinoceros escapes from his cage when a tortoise or piece of

jade is injured in its repository whose is the fault











         zan yu said but at present chwanyu is strong and

near to pi if our chief do not now take it it will hereafter be a

sorrow to his descendants

         confucius said chiu the superior man hates that

declining to say i want such and such a thing and framing

explanations for the conduct

         i have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of

families are not troubled lest their people should be few but

are troubled lest they should not keep their several places that

they are not troubled with fears of poverty but are troubled

with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in

their several places for when the people keep their several

places there will be no poverty when harmony prevails there

will be no scarcity of people and when there is such a

contented repose there will be no rebellious upsettings

         so it is therefore if remoter people are not

submissive all









the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to

attract them to be so and when they have been so attracted

they must be made contented and tranquil

         now here are you yu and chiu assisting your chief

remoter people are not submissive and with your help he

cannot attract them to him in his own territory there are

divisions and downfalls leavings and separations and with

your help he cannot preserve it

         and yet he is planning these hostile movements

within the state i am afraid that the sorrow of the chisun

family will not be on account of chwanyu but will be found

within the screen of their own court











        chap ii  confucius said when good government

prevails in the empire ceremonies music and punitive

military expeditions proceed from the son of heaven when

bad government prevails in the empire ceremonies music and

punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes when

these things proceed from the princes as a rule the cases will

be few in which they do not lose their power in ten

generations when they proceed from the great officers of the

princes as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not

lose their power in five generations when the subsidiary

ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of

the state as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not

lose their power in three generations

         when right principles prevail in the kingdom

government will not be in the hands of the great officers

         when right principles prevail in the kingdom there

will be no discussions among the common people













        chap iii confucius said the revenue of the state has

left the ducal house now for five generations the government

has been in the hands of the great officers for four generations

on this account the descendants of the three hwan are much

reduced

        chap iv confucius said there are three friendships

which are advantageous and three which are injurious

friendship with the upright friendship with the sincere and

friendship with the man of much observation these are

advantageous friendship with the man of specious airs

friendship with the insinuatingly soft and friendship with the

glibtongued these are injurious

        chap v confucius said there are three things men find

enjoyment in which are advantageous and three things they

find enjoyment in which are injurious to find enjoyment in the

discriminating study of ceremonies and music to find

enjoyment in











speaking of the goodness of others to find enjoyment in having

many worthy friends these are advantageous to find

enjoyment in extravagant pleasures to find enjoyment in

idleness and sauntering to find enjoyment in the pleasures of

feasting these are injurious

        chap vi confucius said there are three errors to which

they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station

are liable they may speak when it does not come to them to

speak this is called rashness they may not speak when it

comes to them to speak this is called concealment they may

speak without looking at the countenance of their superior

this is called blindness

        chap vii confucius said there are three things which

the superior man guards against in youth when the physical

powers











are not yet settled he guards against lust when he is strong

and the physical powers are full of vigor he guards against

quarrelsomeness when he is old and the animal powers are

decayed he guards against covetousness

        chap viii  confucius said there are three things of

which the superior man stands in awe he stands in awe of the

ordinances of heaven he stands in awe of great men he stands

in awe of the words of sages

         the mean man does not know the ordinances of

heaven and consequently does not stand in awe of them he is

disrespectful to great men he makes sport of the words of

sages

        chap ix confucius said those who are born with the

possession of knowledge are the highest class of men those

who learn and so readily get possession of knowledge are the

next













those who are dull and stupid and yet compass the learning

are another class next to these as to those who are dull and

stupid and yet do not learn they are the lowest of the

people

        chap x confucius said the superior man has nine

things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration

in regard to the use of his eyes he is anxious to see clearly in

regard to the use of his ears he is anxious to hear distinctly in

regard to his countenance he is anxious that it should be

benign in regard to his demeanor he is anxious that it should

be respectful in regard to his speech he is anxious that it

should be sincere in regard to his doing of business he is

anxious that it should be reverently careful in regard to what

he doubts about he is anxious to question others when he is

angry he thinks of the difficulties his anger may involve him

in when he sees gain to be got he thinks of righteousness

        chap xi  confucius said contemplating good and

pursuing it as if they could not reach it contemplating evil

and shrinking from it as they would from thrusting the hand

into boiling water i have seen such men as i have heard

such words

         living in retirement to study their aims and

practising













righteousness to carry out their principles i have heard

these words but i have not seen such men

        chap xii  the duke ching of chi had a thousand

teams each of four horses but on the day of his death the

people did not praise him for a single virtue poi and shuchi

died of hunger at the foot of the shauyang mountain and the

people down to the present time praise them

         is not that saying illustrated by this

        chap xiii  chan kang asked poyu saying have you

heard any lessons from your father different from what we

have all heard

         poyu replied no he was standing alone once when i

passed below the hall with hasty steps and said to me have

you learned the odes on my replying not yet he added if

you do not learn the odes you will not be fit to converse with

i retired and studied the odes













         another day he was in the same way standing alone

when i passed by below the hall with hasty steps and said to

me have you learned the rules of propriety on my replying

not yet he added if you do not learn the rules of propriety

your character cannot be established i then retired and

learned the rules of propriety

         i have heard only these two things from him

         chang kang retired and quite delighted said i asked

one thing and i have got three things i have heard about the

odes i have heard about the rules of propriety i have also

heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve

towards his son

        chap xiv the wife of the prince of a state is called by

him fu zan she calls herself hsiao tung the people of the

state call





her chun fu zan and to the people of other states they call

her kwa hsiao chun the people of other states also call her

chun fu zan





book xvii yang ho













        chap i  yang ho wished to see confucius but

confucius would not go to see him on this he sent a present of

a pig to confucius who having chosen a time when ho was not

at home went to pay his respects for the gift he met him

however on the way

         ho said to confucius come let me speak with you he

then asked can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in

his











bosom and leaves his country to confusion confucius replied

no can he be called wise who is anxious to be engaged in

public employment and yet is constantly losing the

opportunity of being so confucius again said no the days

and months are passing away the years do not wait for us

confucius said right i will go into office

        chap ii the master said by nature men are nearly

alike by practice they get to be wide apart

        chap iii the master said there are only the wise of

the highest class and the stupid of the lowest class who cannot

be changed













        chap iv  the master having come to wuchang

heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing

         well pleased and smiling he said why use an ox knife

to kill a fowl

         tszeyu replied formerly master i heard you say

when the man of high station is well instructed he loves men

when the man of low station is well instructed he is easily

ruled

         the master said my disciples yens words are right

what i said was only in sport

        chap v kungshan fuzao when he was holding pi and

in an attitude of rebellion invited the master to visit him who

was rather inclined to go

         tszelu was displeased and said indeed you cannot

go why must you think of going to see kungshan













         the master said can it be without some reason that he

has invited me if any one employ me may i not make an

eastern chau

        chap vi tszechang asked confucius about perfect

virtue confucius said to be able to practise five things

everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue he

begged to ask what they were and was told gravity

generosity of soul sincerity earnestness and kindness if you

are grave you will not be treated with disrespect if you are

generous you will win all if you are sincere people will repose

trust in you if you are earnest you will accomplish much if

you are kind this will enable you to employ the services of

others











        chap vii  pi hsi inviting him to visit him the master

was inclined to go

         tszelu said master formerly i have heard you say

when a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil a

superior man will not associate with him pi hsi is in rebellion

holding possession of chungmau if you go to him what shall

be said

         the master said yes i did use these words but is it

not said that if a thing be really hard it may be ground

without being made thin is it not said that if a thing be really

white it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made

black

         am i a bitter gourd how can i be hung up out of the

way of being eaten











        chap viii  the master said yu have you heard the

six words to which are attached six becloudings yu replied i

have not

         sit down and i will tell them to you

         there is the love of being benevolent without the love

of learning the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity

there is the love of knowing without the love of learning the

beclouding here leads to dissipation of mind there is the love

of being sincere without the love of learning the beclouding

here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences there is

the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning

the beclouding here leads to rudeness there is the love of

boldness without the love of learning the beclouding here

leads to insubordination there is the love of firmness without

the love of learning the beclouding here leads to extravagant

conduct













        chap ix  the master said my children why do you

not study the book of poetry

         the odes serve to stimulate the mind

         they may be used for purposes of selfcontemplation

         they teach the art of sociability

         they show how to regulate feelings of resentment

         from them you learn the more immediate duty of

serving ones father and the remoter one of serving ones

prince

         from them we become largely acquainted with the

names of birds beasts and plants

        chap x the master said to poyu do you give yourself

to the chaunan and the shaonan the man who has not

studied the chaunan and the shaonan is like one who stands

with his face right against a wall is he not so











        chap xi the master said it is according to the rules of

propriety they say it is according to the rules of

propriety they say are gems and silk all that is meant by

propriety it is music they say it is music they say are

bells and drums all that is meant by music

        chap xii the master said he who puts on an

appearance of stern firmness while inwardly he is weak is like

one of the small mean people yea is he not like the thief

who breaks through or climbs over a wall

        chap xiii the master said your good careful people of

the villages are the thieves of virtue

        chap xiv the master said to tell as we go along what

we have heard on the way is to cast away our virtue













        chap xv  the master said there are those mean

creatures how impossible it is along with them to serve ones

prince

         while they have not got their aims their anxiety is

how to get them when they have got them their anxiety is lest

they should lose them

         when they are anxious lest such things should be lost

there is nothing to which they will not proceed

        chap xvi  the master said anciently men had three

failings which now perhaps are not to be found

         the highmindedness of antiquity showed itself in a

disregard of small things the highmindedness of the present

day shows itself in wild license the stern dignity of antiquity

showed itself in grave reserve the stern dignity of the present

day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness the stupidity of

antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness the stupidity of

the present day shows itself in sheer deceit











        chap xvii the master said fine words and an

insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue

        chap xviii the master said i hate the manner in

which purple takes away the luster of vermilion i hate the

way in which the songs of chang confound the music of the ya

i hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms

and families

        chap xix  the master said i would prefer not

speaking

         tszekung said if you master do not speak what

shall we your disciples have to record

         the master said does heaven speak the four seasons

pursue their courses and all things are continually being

produced but does heaven say anything











        chap xx zu pei wished to see confucius but confucius

declined on the ground of being sick to see him when the

bearer of this message went out at the door the master took

his lute and sang to it in order that pei might hear him

        chap xxi  tsai wo asked about the three years

mourning for parents saying that one year was long enough

         if the superior man said he abstains for three years

from the observances of propriety those observances will be

quite lost if for three years he abstains from music music will

be ruined

         within a year the old grain is exhausted and the new

grain has sprung up and in procuring fire by friction we go

through all the changes of wood for that purpose after a

complete year the mourning may stop

         the master said if you were after a year to eat good

rice and wear embroidered clothes would you feel at ease i

should replied wo











         the master said if you can feel at ease do it but a

superior man during the whole period of mourning does not

enjoy pleasant food which he may eat nor derive pleasure

from music which he may hear he also does not feel at ease if

he is comfortably lodged therefore he does not do what you

propose but now you feel at ease and may do it

         tsai wo then went out and the master said this

shows yus want of virtue it is not till a child is three years old

that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents and the three

years mourning is universally observed throughout the

empire did yu enjoy the three years love of his parents















        chap xxii the master said hard is it to deal with him

who will stuff himself with food the whole day without

applying his mind to anything good are there not gamesters

and chess players to be one of these would still be better than

doing nothing at all

        chap xxiii tszelu said does the superior man esteem

valour the master said the superior man holds

righteousness to be of highest importance a man in a superior

situation having valour without righteousness will be guilty of

insubordination one of the lower people having valour without

righteousness will commit robbery

        chap xxiv  tszekung said has the superior man his

hatreds also the master said he has his hatreds he hates

those who proclaim the evil of others he hates the man who











being in a low station slanders his superiors he hates those

who have valour merely and are unobservant of propriety he

hates those who are forward and determined and at the same

time of contracted understanding

         the master then inquired tsze have you also your

hatreds tszekung replied i hate those who pry out matters

and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom i hate those who

are only not modest and think that they are valourous i hate

those who make known secrets and think that they are

straightforward

        chap xxv the master said of all people girls and

servants are the most difficult to behave to if you are familiar

with them they lose their humility if you maintain a reserve

towards them they are discontented

        chap xxvi the master said when a man at forty is the

object of dislike he will always continue what he is





book xviii wei tsze











        chap i  the viscount of wei withdrew from the court

the viscount of chi became a slave to chau pikan

remonstrated with him and died

         confucius said the yin dynasty possessed these three

men of virtue

        chap ii hui of liuhsia being chief criminal judge was

thrice dismissed from his office some one said to him is it not

yet time for you sir to leave this he replied serving men in

an upright way where shall i go to and not experience such a

thricerepeated













dismissal if i choose to serve men in a crooked way what

necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents

        chap iii the duke ching of chi with reference to the

manner in which he should treat confucius said i cannot treat

him as i would the chief of the chi family i will treat him in a

manner between that accorded to the chief of the chi and that

given to the chief of the mang family he also said i am old i

cannot use his doctrines confucius took his departure

        chap iv the people of chi sent to lu a present of

female musicians which chi hwan received and for three days

no court was held confucius took his departure

        chap v  the madman of chu chiehyu passed by

confucius singing and saying o fang o fang how is your













virtue degenerated as to the past reproof is useless but the

future may still be provided against give up your vain pursuit

give up your vain pursuit peril awaits those who now engage

in affairs of government

         confucius alighted and wished to converse with him

but chiehyu hastened away so that he could not talk with

him

        chap vi  changtsu and chiehni were at work in the

field together when confucius passed by them and sent tsze

lu to inquire for the ford

         changtsu said who is he that holds the reins in the

carriage there tszelu told him it is kung chiu is it not

kung chiu of lu asked he yes was the reply to which the

other rejoined he knows the ford

         tszelu then inquired of chiehni who said to him

who











are you sir he answered i am chung yu are you not the

disciple of kung chiu of lu asked the other i am replied

he and then chiehni said to him disorder like a swelling

flood spreads over the whole empire and who is he that will

change its state for you than follow one who merely

withdraws from this one and that one had you not better

follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether

with this he fell to covering up the seed and proceeded with

his work without stopping

         tszelu went and reported their remarks when the

master observed with a sigh it is impossible to associate with

birds and beasts as if they were the same with us if i

associate not with these people with mankind with whom

shall i associate if right principles prevailed through the

empire there would be no use for me to change its state













        chap vii  tszelu following the master happened to

fall behind when he met an old man carrying across his

shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds tszelu said to him

have you seen my master sir the old man replied your four

limbs are unaccustomed to toil you cannot distinguish the five

kinds of grain who is your master with this he planted his

staff in the ground and proceeded to weed

         tszelu joined his hands across his breast and stood

before him

         the old man kept tszelu to pass the night in his

house killed a fowl prepared millet and feasted him he also

introduced to him his two sons

         next day tszelu went on his way and reported his

adventure the master said he is a recluse and sent tszelu

back to see him again but when he got to the place the old

man was gone

         tszelu then said to the family not to take office is not













righteous if the relations between old and young may not be

neglected how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be

observed between sovereign and minister wishing to

maintain his personal purity he allows that great relation to

come to confusion a superior man takes office and performs

the righteous duties belonging to it as to the failure of right

principles to make progress he is aware of that

        chap viii  the men who have retired to privacy from

the world have been poi shuchi yuchung iyi chuchang

hui of liuhsia and shaolien

         the master said refusing to surrender their wills or

to submit to any taint in their persons such i think were

poi and shuchi

         it may be said of hui of liuhsia and of shaolien that

they surrendered their wills and submitted to taint in their

persons











but their words corresponded with reason and their actions

were such as men are anxious to see this is all that is to be

remarked in them

         it may be said of yuchung and iyi that while they

hid themselves in their seclusion they gave a license to their

words but in their persons they succeeded in preserving their

purity and in their retirement they acted according to the

exigency of the times

         i am different from all these i have no course for

which i am predetermined and no course against which i am

predetermined

book xix tszechang







        chap i tszechang said the scholar trained for public

duty seeing threatening danger is prepared to sacrifice his life

when the opportunity of gain is presented to him he thinks of

righteousness in sacrificing his thoughts are reverential in

mourning his thoughts are about the grief which he should

feel such a man commands our approbation indeed

        chap ii tszechang said when a man holds fast to

virtue but without seeking to enlarge it and believes right

principles but without firm sincerity what account can be

made of his existence or nonexistence













        chap iii the disciples of tszehsia asked tszechang

about the principles that should characterize mutual

intercourse tszechang asked what does tszehsia say on the

subject they replied tszehsia says associate with those

who can advantage you put away from you those who cannot

do so tszechang observed this is different from what i

have learned the superior man honours the talented and

virtuous and bears with all he praises the good and pities the

incompetent am i possessed of great talents and virtue

who is there among men whom i will not bear with am i

devoid of talents and virtue men will put me away from

them what have we to do with the putting away of others

        chap iv tszehsia said even in inferior studies and

employments there is something worth being looked at but if

it be











attempted to carry them out to what is remote there is a

danger of their proving inapplicable therefore the superior

man does not practise them

        chap v tszehsia said he who from day to day

recognises what he has not yet and from month to month does

not forget what he has attained to may be said indeed to love

to learn

        chap vi tszehsia said there are learning extensively

and having a firm and sincere aim inquiring with earnestness

and reflecting with selfapplication virtue is in such a

course

        chap vii tszehsia said mechanics have their shops to

dwell in in order to accomplish their works the superior man

learns in order to reach to the utmost of his principles













        chap viii tszehsia said the mean man is sure to gloss

his faults

        chap ix tszehsia said the superior man undergoes

three changes looked at from a distance he appears stern

when approached he is mild when he is heard to speak his

language is firm and decided

        chap x tszehsia said the superior man having

obtained their confidence may then impose labours on his

people if he have not gained their confidence they will think

that he is oppressing them having obtained the confidence of

his prince one may then remonstrate with him if he have not

gained his confidence the prince will think that he is vilifying

him

        chap xi tszehsia said when a person does not

transgress the boundary line in the great virtues he may pass

and repass it in the small virtues













        chap xii  tszeyu said the disciples and followers of

tszehsia in sprinkling and sweeping the ground in answering

and replying in advancing and receding are sufficiently

accomplished but these are only the branches of learning and

they are left ignorant of what is essential how can they be

acknowledged as sufficiently taught

         tszehsia heard of the remark and said alas yen yu

is wrong according to the way of the superior man in teaching

what departments are there which he considers of prime

importance and delivers what are there which he considers of

secondary importance and allows himself to be idle about but

as in the case of plants which are assorted according to their

classes so he deals with his disciples how can the way of a

superior man be such as to make fools of any of them is it not

the sage alone who can unite in one the beginning and the

consummation of learning













        chap xiii tszehsia said the officer having discharged

all his duties should devote his leisure to learning the student

having completed his learning should apply himself to be an

officer

        chap xiv tszehsia said mourning having been carried

to the utmost degree of grief should stop with that

        chap xv tszehsia said my friend chang can do things

which are hard to be done but yet he is not perfectly virtuous

        chap xvi the philosopher tsang said how imposing is

the manner of chang it is difficult along with him to practise

virtue

        chap xvii the philosopher tsang said i heard this

from our master men may not have shown what is in them

to the full extent and yet they will be found to do so on

occasion of mourning for their parents













        chap xviii the philosopher tsang said i have heard

this from our master the filial piety of mang chwang in

other matters was what other men are competent to but as

seen in his not changing the ministers of his father nor his

fathers mode of government it is difficult to be attained to

        chap xix the chief of the mang family having

appointed yang fu to be chief criminal judge the latter

consulted the philosopher tsang tsang said the rulers have

failed in their duties and the people consequently have been

disorganised for a long time when you have found out the

truth of any accusation be grieved for and pity them and do

not feel joy at your own ability

        chap xx tszekung said chaus wickedness was not so

great as that name implies therefore the superior man hates

to dwell















in a lowlying situation where all the evil of the world will

flow in upon him

        chap xxi tszekung said the faults of the superior

man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon he has his

faults and all men see them he changes again and all men

look up to him

        chap xxii  kungsun chao of wei asked tszekung

saying from whom did chungni get his learning

         tszekung replied the doctrines of wan and wu have

not yet fallen to the ground they are to be found among men

men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of

them and others not possessing such talents and virtue

remember the smaller thus all possess the doctrines of wan

and wu where could our master go that he should not have an

opportunity of learning them and yet what necessity was

there for his having a regular master











        chap xxiii  shusun wushu observed to the great

officers in the court saying tszekung is superior to chungni

         tszefu chingpo reported the observation to tsze

kung who said let me use the comparison of a house and its

encompassing wall my wall only reaches to the shoulders one

may peep over it and see whatever is valuable in the

apartments

         the wall of my master is several fathoms high if one

do not find the door and enter by it he cannot see the ancestral

temple with its beauties nor all the officers in their rich array

         but i may assume that they are few who find the door

was not the observation of the chief only what might have

been expected













        chap xxiv shusun wushu having spoken revilingly of

chungni tszekung said it is of no use doing so chungni

cannot be reviled the talents and virtue of other men are

hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over chungni is

the sun or moon which it is not possible to step over although

a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage what harm

can he do to the sun or moon he only shows that he does not

know his own capacity

        chap xxv  chan tszechin addressing tszekung

said you are too modest how can chungni be said to be

superior to you

         tszekung said to him for one word a man is often

deemed to be wise and for one word he is often deemed to be

foolish we ought to be careful indeed in what we say

         our master cannot be attained to just in the same way

as the heavens cannot be gone up to by the steps of a stair







         were our master in the position of the ruler of a state

or the chief of a family we should find verified the description

which has been given of a sages rule he would plant the

people and forthwith they would be established he would lead

them on and forthwith they would follow him he would make

them happy and forthwith multitudes would resort to his

dominions he would stimulate them and forthwith they would

be harmonious while he lived he would be glorious when he

died he would be bitterly lamented how is it possible for him

to be attained to





book xx yao yueh











        chap i  yao said oh you shun the heaven

determined order of succession now rests in your person

sincerely hold fast the due mean if there shall be distress and

want within the four seas the heavenly revenue will come to a

perpetual end

         shun also used the same language in giving charge to

         chau conferred great gifts and the good were enriched

         although he has his near relatives they are not equal

to my virtuous men the people are throwing blame upon me

the one man

         he carefully attended to the weights and measures

examined the body of the laws restored the discarded officers

and the good government of the kingdom took its course

         he revived states that had been extinguished restored

families whose line of succession had been broken and called

to office those who had retired into obscurity so that

throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned

towards him

         what he attached chief importance to were the food of

the people the duties of mourning and sacrifices

         by his generosity he won all by his sincerity he made

the people repose trust in him by his earnest activity his

achievements were great by his justice all were delighted











        chap ii  tszechang asked confucius saying in what

way should a person in authority act in order that he may

conduct government properly the master replied let him

honour the five excellent and banish away the four bad

things then may he conduct government properly tsze

chang said what are meant by the five excellent things the

master said when the person in authority is beneficent

without great expenditure when he lays tasks on the people

without their repining when he pursues what he desires

without being covetous when he maintains a dignified ease

without being proud when he is majestic without being fierce

         tszechang said what is meant by being beneficent

without great expenditure the master replied when the

person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the

things from which











they naturally derive benefit is not this being beneficent

without great expenditure when he chooses the labours which

are proper and makes them labour on them who will repine

when his desires are set on benevolent government and he

secures it who will accuse him of covetousness whether he

has to do with many people or few or with things great or

small he does not dare to indicate any disrespect is not this

to maintain a dignified ease without any pride he adjusts his

clothes and cap and throws a dignity into his looks so that

thus dignified he is looked at with awe is not this to be

majestic without being fierce

         tszechang then asked what are meant by the four

bad things the master said to put the people to death

without having instructed them this is called cruelty to

require from them suddenly the full tale of work without

having given them warning this is called oppression to issue

orders as if without urgency at first and when the time

comes to insist on them with severity this is called injury

and generally in the giving pay









or rewards to men to do it in a stingy way this is called

acting the part of a mere official

        chap iii  the master said without recognising the

ordinances of heaven it is impossible to be a superior man

         without an acquaintance with the rules of propriety it

is impossible for the character to be established

         without knowing the force of words it is impossible to

know men

chapter i

of the chinese classics generally



section i

books included under the name of the chinese classics
 the books now recognised as of highest authority in china are

comprehended under the denominations of the five ching  and

the four shu   the term ching is of textile origin and

signifies the warp threads of a web and their adjustment an easy

application of it is to denote what is regular and insures regularity as

used with reference to books it indicates their authority on the subjects of

which they treat the five ching are the five canonical works

containing the truth upon the highest subjects from the sages of china and

which should be received as law by all generations the term shu

simply means writings or books  the pencil speaking it may

be used of a single character or of books containing thousands of

characters

 the five ching are the yi  or as it has been styled the

book of changes the shu  or the book of history the shih

 or the book of poetry the li chi  or record of rites and the

chun chiu  or spring and autumn a chronicle of events

extending from  to  bc the authorship or compilation rather of all

these works is loosely attributed to confucius but much of the li chi is

from later hands of the yi the shu and the shih it is only in the first that

we find additions attributed to the philosopher himself in the shape of

appendixes the chun chiu is the only one of the five ching which can

with an approximation to correctness be described as of his own making



 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the four books is an abbreviation for the books of the four

philosophers  the first is the lun yu  or digested conversations

being occupied chiefly with the sayings of confucius he is the philosopher

to whom it belongs it appears in this work under the title of confucian

analects the second is the ta hsio  or great learning now commonly

attributed to tsang shan  a disciple of the sage  he is he philosopher of

it the third is the chung yung  or doctrine of the mean as the name

has often been translated though it would be better to render it as in the

present edition by the state of equilibrium and harmony its composition

is ascribed to kung chi  the grandson of confucius he is the philosopher

of it  the fourth contains the works of mencius

 this arrangement of the classical books which is commonly supposed

to have originated with the scholars of the sung dynasty is defective the

great learning and the doctrine of the mean are both found in

the record of rites being the thirtyninth and twentyeighth books

respectively of that compilation according to the best arrangement of it

 the oldest enumerations of the classical books specify only the five

ching the yo chi or record of music  the remains of which now

form one of the books in the li chi was sometimes added to those making

with them the six ching a division was also made into nine

ching consisting of the yi the shih the shu the chau li  or ritual of

chau the i li  or certain ceremonial usages the li chi and the

annotated editions of the chun chiu  by tso chiuming  kung

yang kao  and kuliang chih  in the famous compilation of the

classical books undertaken by order of taitsung the second emperor of

the tang dynasty ad  and which appeared in the reign of his

successor there are thirteen ching viz the yi the shih the shu the

three editions of the chun chiu the li chi the chau li the i li the

confucian analects the r ya  a sort of ancient dictionary the

hsiao ching  or classic of filial piety and the works of mencius

 a distinction however was made among the works thus



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
comprehended under the same common name and mencius the lun yu

the ta hsio the chung yung and the hsiao ching were spoken of as the

hsiao ching or smaller classics it thus appears contrary to the ordinary

opinion on the subject that the ta hsio and chung yung had been

published as separate treatises before the sung dynasty and that four

books as distinguished from the greater ching had also previously found a

place in the literature of china 



section ii
the authority of the chinese classics
 this subject will be discussed in connexion with each separate work

and it is only designed here to exhibit generally the evidence on which the

chinese classics claim to be received as genuine productions of the time to

which they are referred

 in the memoirs of the former han dynasty bc ad  we

have one chapter which we may call the history of literature  it

commences thus after the death of confucius  there was an end of his

exquisite words and when his seventy disciples had passed away violence

began to be done to their meaning it came about that there were five

different editions of the chun chiu four of the shih and several of the yi

amid the disorder and collisions of the warring states bc  truth

and falsehood were still more in a state of warfare and a sad confusion

marked the words of the various scholars then came the calamity inflicted

under the chin dynasty bc  when the literary monuments

were destroyed by fire in order to keep the people in ignorance but by

and by there arose the han dynasty which set itself to remedy the evil

wrought by the chin great efforts were made to collect slips and tablets

 and the way was thrown wide open for the bringing in of books in the

time of the emperor hsiaowu  bc  portions of books being

wanting and tablets lost so that ceremonies and music were



 for the statements in the two last paragraphs see   



    

 

  slips and tablets of bamboo which supplied in those days the place

of paper

 
suffering great damage he was moved to sorrow and said i am very

sad for this he therefore formed the plan of repositories in which the

books might be stored and appointed officers to transcribe books on an

extensive scale embracing the works of the various scholars that they

might all be placed in the repositories the emperor chang bc 

finding that a portion of the books still continued dispersed or missing

commissioned chan nang the superintendent of guests  to search for

undiscovered books throughout the empire and by special edict ordered

the chief of the banqueting house liu hsiang  to examine the classical

works along with the commentaries on them the writings of the scholars

and all poetical productions the mastercontroller of infantry zan hwang

 to examine the books on the art of war the grand historiographer yin

hsien  to examine the books treating of the art of numbers ie

divination and the imperial physician li chukwo  to examine the

books on medicine whenever any book was done with hsiang forthwith

arranged it indexed it and made a digest of it which was presented to the

emperor while this work was in progress hsiang died and the emperor ai

bc ad  appointed his son hsin  a master of the imperial

carriages to complete his fathers work on this hsin collected all the

books and presented a report of them under seven divisions

the first of these divisions seems to have been a general catalogue 

containing perhaps only the titles of the works included in the other six

the second embraced the classical works  from the abstract of it which

is preserved in the chapter referred to we find that there were 

collections of the yiching from thirteen different individuals or editors

  collections of the shuching from nine different individuals 

volumes of the shihching from six different individuals  of the books

of rites  collec



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    how much of the whole work was contained in

each  it is impossible to determine p regis says pien quemadmodum

gallice dicimus des pieces dloquence de posie
    the collections of the shihching are mentioned

under the name of chuan sections portions had pien been

used it might have been understood of individual odes this change of

terms shows that by pien in the other summaries we are not to

understand single blocks or chapters
tions from thirteen different individuals of the books on music 

collections from six different editors  collections of history under the

heading of the chun chiu from twentythree different individuals 

collections of the lun yu including the analects and kindred fragments

from twelve different individuals of the hsiaoching embracing also the

r ya and some other portions of the ancient literature  collections

from eleven different individuals and finally of the lesser learning being

works on the form of the characters  collections from eleven different

individuals the works of mencius were included in the second division 

among the writings of what were deemed orthodox scholars  of which

there were  collections from fiftythree different individuals

 the above important document is sufficient to show how the

emperors of the han dynasty as soon as they had made good their

possession of the empire turned their attention to recover the ancient

literature of the nation the classical books engaging their first care and

how earnestly and effectively the scholars of the time responded to the

wishes of their rulers in addition to the facts specified in the preface to it

i may relate that the ordinance of the chin dynasty against possessing the

classical books with the exception as it will appear in its proper place of

the yiching was repealed by the second sovereign of the han the

emperor hsiao hui  in the fourth year of his reign bc  and that a

large portion of the shuching was recovered in the time of the third

emperor bc  while in the year bc  a special board was

constituted consisting of literati who were put in charge of the five ching



 the collections reported on by liu hsin suffered damage in the

troubles which began ad  and continued till the rise of the second or

eastern han dynasty in the year  the founder of it ad 

zealously promoted the undertaking of his predecessors and additional

repositories were required for the books which were collected his

successors the emperors hsiaoming   hsiaochang  

and hsiaohwo   took a part themselves in the studies and

discussions of the literary tribunal and



 

 

 

  

 

 

 
the emperor hsiaoling  between the years  had the text of

the five ching as it had been fixed cut in slabs of stone and set up in the

capital outside the gate of the grand college some old accounts say that

the characters were in three different forms but they were only in one

form  see the th book of chu itsuns great work

 since the han the successive dynasties have considered the literary

monuments of the country to be an object of their special care many of

them have issued editions of the classics embodying the commentaries of

preceding generations no dynasty has distinguished itself more in this line

than the present manchau possessors of the empire in fine the evidence

is complete that the classical books of china have come down from at least

a century before our christian era substantially the same as we have them

at present

 but it still remains to inquire in what condition we may suppose the

books were when the scholars of the han dynasty commenced their labors

upon them they acknowledge that the tablets  we cannot here speak of

manuscripts  were mutilated and in disorder was the injury which

they had received of such an extent that all the care and study put forth

on the small remains would be of little use this question can be answered

satisfactorily only by an examination of the evidence which is adduced for

the text of each particular classic but it can be made apparent that there is

nothing in the nature of the case to interfere with our believing that the

materials were sufficient to enable the scholars to execute the work

intrusted to them

 the burning of the ancient books by order of the founder of the chin

dynasty is always referred to as the greatest disaster which they

sustained and with this is coupled the slaughter of many of the literati by

the same monarch

the account which we have of these transactions in the historical

records is the following 

in his th year the th year that is after he had ascended the

throne of chin it was only the th year after he had been acknowledged

sovereign of the empire coinciding with bc  the emperor returning

from a visit to the south which had extended



 

 i have thought it well to endeavour to translate the whole of the

passages father de mailla merely constructs from them a narrative of his

own see lhistoire gnrale de la china tome ii pp  the 

avoids the difficulties of the original by giving an abridgment of it
as far as yueh gave a feast in his palace at hsienyang when the great

scholars amounting to seventy men appeared and wished him a long life

 one of the principal ministers chau chingchan  came forward and

said formerly the state of chin was only  li in extent but your

majesty by your spiritlike efficacy and intelligent wisdom has

tranquillized and settled the whole empire and driven away all barbarous

tribes so that wherever the sun and moon shine all rulers appear before

you as guests acknowledging subjection you have formed the states of the

various princes into provinces and districts where the people enjoy a

happy tranquillity suffering no more from the calamities of war and

contention this condition of things will be transmitted for 

generations from the highest antiquity there has been no one in awful

virtue like your majesty

the emperor was pleased with this flattery when shunyu yueh 

one of the great scholars a native of chi advanced and said the

sovereigns of yin and chau for more than a thousand years invested their

sons and younger brothers and meritorious ministers with domains and

rule and could thus depend upon them for support and aid that i have

heard but now your majesty is in possession of all within the seas and

your sons and younger brothers are nothing but private individuals the

issue will be that some one will arise to play the part of tien chang  or

of the six nobles of tsin without the support of your own family

where will you find the aid which you may require that a state of things

not modelled from the lessons of antiquity can long continue that is

what i have not heard ching is now showing himself to be a flatterer who

increases the errors of your majesty and not a loyal minister

the emperor requested the opinions of others on this representation

and the premier li sze  said the five emperors were not one the

double of the other nor did the three dynasties accept one anothers ways

each had a peculiar system of government not for the sake of the

contrariety but as being required by the changed times now your

majesty has laid the foundations of



  the  were not only great scholars but had an

official rank there was what we may call a college of them consisting of

seventy members

  

 

    should probably be  as it is given in the tung chien see

analects xiv xxii tien hang was the same as chan chang of that

chapter

 
imperial sway so that it will last for  generations this is indeed

beyond what a stupid scholar can understand and moreover yueh only

talks of things belonging to the three dynasties which are not fit to be

models to you at other times when the princes were all striving together

they endeavoured to gather the wandering scholars about them but now

the empire is in a stable condition and laws and ordinances issue from one

supreme authority let those of the people who abide in their homes

give their strength to the toils of husbandry while those who become

scholars should study the various laws and prohibitions instead of doing

this however the scholars do not learn what belongs to the present day

but study antiquity they go on to condemn the present time leading the

masses of the people astray and to disorder

at the risk of my life i the prime minister say formerly when the

nation was disunited and disturbed there was no one who could give unity

to it the princes therefore stood up together constant references were

made to antiquity to the injury of the present state baseless statements

were dressed up to confound what was real and men made a boast of their

own peculiar learning to condemn what their rulers appointed and now

when your majesty has consolidated the empire and distinguishing black

from white has constituted it a stable unity they still honour their

peculiar learning and combine together they teach men what is contrary

to your laws when they hear that an ordinance has been issued every one

sets to discussing it with his learning in the court they are dissatisfied in

heart out of it they keep talking in the streets while they make a

pretense of vaunting their master they consider it fine to have

extraordinary views of their own and so they lead on the people to be

guilty of murmuring and evil speaking if these things are not prohibited

your majestys authority will decline and parties will be formed the best

way is to prohibit them i pray that all the records in charge of the

historiographers be burned excepting those of chin that with the

exception of those officers belonging to the board of great scholars all

throughout the empire who presume to keep copies of the shihching or of

the shuching or of the books of the hundred schools be required to go

with them to the officers in charge of the several districts and burn them

 that all who may dare to speak



 
together about the shih and the shu be put to death and their bodies

exposed in the marketplace that those who make mention of the past so

as to blame the present be put to death along with their relatives that

officers who shall know of the violation of those rules and not inform

against the offenders be held equally guilty with them and that whoever

shall not have burned their books within thirty days after the issuing of

the ordinance be branded and sent to labor on the wall for four years

the only books which should be spared are those on medicine divination

and husbandry whoever wants to learn the laws may go to the

magistrates and learn of them

the imperial decision was  approved

the destruction of the scholars is related more briefly in the year after

the burning of the books the resentment of the emperor was excited by

the remarks and the flight of two scholars who had been favourites with

him and he determined to institute a strict inquiry about all of their class

in hsienyang to find out whether they had been making ominous

speeches about him and disturbing the minds of the people the

investigation was committed to the censors  and it being discovered

that upwards of  scholars had violated the prohibitions they were all

buried alive in pits  for a warning to the empire while degradation and

banishment were employed more strictly than before against all who fell

under suspicion the emperors eldest son fusu remonstrated with him

saying that such measures against those who repeated the words of

confucius and sought to imitate him would alienate all the people from

their infant dynasty but his interference offended him father so much that

he was sent off from court to be with the general who was superintending

the building of the great wall

 no attempts have been made by chinese critics and historians to

discredit the record of these events though some have questioned the

extent of the injury inflicted by them on the monuments of their ancient

literature  it is important to observe that the edict against the books

did not extend to the yiching which was



  

    the meaning of this passage as a whole

is sufficiently plain but i am unable to make out the force of the phrase 



 see the remarks of chamg chiatsi  of the sung dynasty on the

subject in the  bk clxxiv p 
exempted as being a work on divination nor did it extend to the other

classics which were in charge of the board of great scholars there ought to

have been no difficulty in finding copies when the han dynasty

superseded that of the chin and probably there would have been none

but for the sack of the capital in bc  by hsiang yu the formidable

opponent of the founder of the house of han then we are told the fires

blazed for three months among the palaces and public buildings and must

have proved as destructive to the copies of the great scholars as the edict

of the tyrant had been to the copies among the people

it is to be noted also that the life of shih hwang ti lasted only three

years after the promulgation of his edict he died in bc  and the reign

of his second son who succeeded him lasted only other three years a brief

period of disorder and struggling for the supreme authority between

different chiefs ensured but the reign of the founder of the han dynasty

dates from bc  thus eleven years were all which intervened between

the order for the burning of the books and rise of that family which

signaled itself by the care which it bestowed for their recovery and from

the edict of the tyrant of chin against private individuals having copies in

their keeping to its express abrogation by the emperor hsiao hui there

were only twentytwo years we may believe indeed that vigorous efforts

to carry the edict into effect would not be continued longer than the life of

its author that is not for more than about three years the calamity

inflicted upon the ancient books of china by the house of chin could not

have approached to anything like a complete destruction of them there

would be no occasion for the scholars of the han dynasty in regard to the

bulk of their ancient literature to undertake more than the work of

recension and editing

 the idea of forgery by them on a large scale is out of the question

the catalogues of liang hsin enumerated more than  volumes of a

larger or smaller size the productions of nearly  different writers and

arranged in thirtyeight subdivisions of subjects  in the third catalogue

the first subdivision contained the orthodox writers  to the number of

fiftythree with  works or portions of their works between mencius

and



    

 
kung chi the grandson of confucius eight different authors have place

the second subdivision contained the works of the taoist school 

amounting to  collections from thirtyseven different authors the

sixth subdivision contained the mohist writers  to the number of six

with their productions in  collections i specify these two subdivisions

because they embrace the works of schools or sects antagonistic to that of

confucius and some of them still hold a place in chinese literature and

contain many references to the five classics and to confucius and his

disciples

 the inquiry pursued in the above paragraphs conducts us to the

conclusion that the materials from which the classics as they have come

down to us were compiled and edited in the two centuries preceding our

christian era were genuine remains going back to a still more remote

period the injury which they sustained from the dynasty of chin was i

believe the same in character as that to which they were exposed during

all the time of the warring states it may have been more intense in

degree but the constant warfare which prevailed for some centuries

among the different states which composed the kingdom was eminently

unfavourable to the cultivation of literature mencius tells us how the

princes had made away with many of the records of antiquity from which

their own usurpations and innovations might have been condemned 

still the times were not unfruitful either in scholars or statesmen to

whom the ways and monuments of antiquity were dear and the space

from the rise of the chin dynasty to the death of confucius was not very

great it only amounted to  years between these two periods mencius

stands as a connecting link born probably in the year bc  he reached

by the intervention of kung chi back to the sage himself and as his death

happened bc  we are brought down to within nearly half a century of

the chin dynasty from all these considerations we may proceed with

confidence to consider each separate work believing that we have in these

classics and books what the great sage of china and his disciples gave to

their country more than  years ago

formation of the text of the analects by the scholars of the han

dynasty


 when the work of collecting and editing the remains of the classical

books was undertaken by the scholars of han there appeared two

different copies of the analects one from lu the native state of confucius

and the other from chi the state adjoining between these there were

considerable differences the former consisted of twenty books or

chapters the same as those into which the classic is now divided the

latter contained two books in addition and in the twenty books which

they had in common the chapters and sentences were somewhat more

numerous than in the lu exemplar

 the names of several individuals are given who devoted themselves

to the study of those two copies of the classic among the patrons of the lu

copy are mentioned the names of hsiahau shang grandtutor of the heir

apparent who died at the age of  and in the reign of the emperor hsuan

bc   hsiao wangchih  a generalofficer who died in the

reign of the emperor yuan bc  wei hsien who was a premier of

the empire from bc  and his son hsuanchang  as patrons of the

chi copy we have wang ching who was a censor in the year bc  

yung shang  and wang chi  a statesman who died in the beginning of

the reign of the emperor yuan

 but a third copy of the analects was discovered about bc  one of

the sons of the emperor ching was appointed king of lu  in the year bc

 and some time after wishing to enlarge his palace he proceeded to

pull down the house of the kung family known as that where confucius

himself had lived



 

  

    

 

 

 

  or 
while doing so there were found in the wall copies of the shuching

the chun chiu the hsiaoching and the lun yu or analects which had

been deposited there when the edict for the burning of the books was

issued there were all written however in the most ancient form of the

chinese character  which had fallen into disuse and the king returned

them to the kung family the head of which kung ankwo  gave

himself to the study of them and finally in obedience to an imperial order

published a work called the lun yu with explanations of the characters

and exhibition of the meaning 

 the recovery of this copy will be seen to be a most important

circumstance in the history f the text of the analects it is referred to by

chinese writers as the old lun yu in the historical narrative which we

have of the affair a circumstance is added which may appear to some

minds to throw suspicion on the whole account the king was finally

arrested we are told in his purpose to destroy the house by hearing the

sounds of bells musical stones lutes and citherns as he was ascending the

steps that led to the ancestral hall or temple this incident was contrived

we may suppose by the kung family to preserve the house or it may

have been devised by the historian to glorify the sage but we may not on

account of it discredit the finding of the ancient copies of the books we

have kung ankwos own account of their being committed to him and of

the ways which he took to decipher them the work upon the analects

mentioned above has not indeed come down to us but his labors on the

shuching still remain

 it has been already stated that the lun yu of chi contained two

books more than that of lu in this respect the old lun yu agreed with the

lu exemplar those two books were wanting in it as well the last book of

the lu lun was divided in it however into two the chapter beginning

yao said forming a whole book by itself and the remaining two chapters

formed another book beginning tszechang with this trifling difference

the old and the lu copies appear to have agreed together

 chang yu prince of anchang  who died bc  after having



   lit tadpole  characters they were it is said the original

forms devised by tsangchieh with large heads and fine tails like the

creature from which they were named see the notes to the preface to the

shuching in the thirteen classics

 

  see the preface to the lun yu in the thirteen ching it has

been my principal authority in this section

  
sustained several of the highest offices of the empire instituted a

comparison between the exemplars of lu and chi with a view to

determine the true text the result of his labors appeared in twentyone

books which are mentioned in liu hsins catalogue they were known as

the lun of prince chang  and commanded general approbation to

chang yu is commonly ascribed the ejecting from the classic the two

additional books which the chi exemplar contained but ma twanlin

prefers to rest that circumstance on the authority of the old lun which we

have seen was without them  if we had the two books we might find

sufficient reason from their contents to discredit them that may have

been sufficient for chang yu to condemn them as he did but we can hardly

supposed that he did not have before him the old lun which had come to

light about a century before he published his work

 in the course of the second century a new edition of the analects

with a commentary was published by one of the greatest scholars which

china has ever produced chang hsuan known also as chang kangchang

 he died in the reign of the emperor hsien ad   at the age

of  and the amount of his labors on the ancient classical literature is

almost incredible while he adopted the lu lun as the received text of his

time he compared it minutely with those of chi and the old exemplar in

the last section f this chapter will be found a list of the readings in his

commentary different from those which are now acknowledged in

deference to the authority of chu hsi of the sung dynasty they are not

many and their importance is but trifling

 on the whole the above statements will satisfy the reader of the care

with which the text of the lun yu was fixed during the dynasty of han



section ii

at what time and by whom the analects were written their plan

and authenticity


 at the commencement of the notes upon the first book under the

heading the title of the work i have given the received account of its

authorship which precedes the catalogue



 

  bk clxxxiv p 

  

 
of liu hsin according to that the analects were compiled by the

disciples if confucius coming together after his death and digesting the

memorials of his discourses and conversations which they had severally

preserved but this cannot be true we may believe indeed that many of

the disciples put on record conversations which they had had with their

master and notes about his manners and incidents of his life and that

these have been incorporated with the work which we have but that

work must have taken its present form at a period somewhat later

in book viii chapters iii iv we have some notices of the last days of

tsang shan and are told that he was visited on his deathbed by the

officer mang ching now ching was the posthumous title of chung

sun chieh  and we find him alive li chi ii pt ii  after the death of

duke tao of lu  which took place bc  about fifty years after the

death of confucius

again book xix is all occupied with the sayings of the disciples

confucius personally does not appear in it parts of it as chapters iii xii

and xviii carry us down to a time when the disciples had schools and

followers of their own and were accustomed to sustain their teachings by

referring to the lessons which they had learned from the sage

thirdly there is the second chapter of book xi the second paragraph of

which is evidently a note by the compilers of the work enumerating ten of

the principal disciples and classifying them according to their

distinguishing characteristics we can hardly suppose it to have been

written while any of the ten were alive but there is among them the name

of tszehsia who lived to the age of about a hundred we find him bc

 threequarters of a century after the death of confucius at the court

of wei to the prince of which he is reported to have presented some of the

classical books 

 we cannot therefore accept the above account of the origin of the

analects that they were compiled by the disciples of confucius much

more likely is the view that we owe the work to their disciples in the note

on i ii i a peculiarity is pointed out in the use of the surnames of yew zo

and tsang shan which



 see chu hsis commentary in loc     



 

  see the  bk i p 
has made some chinese critics attribute the compilation to their

followers but this conclusion does not stand investigation others have

assigned different portions to different schools thus book v is given to

the disciples of tszekung book xi to those of min tszechien book xiv

to yuan hsien and book xvi has been supposed to be interpolated from

the analects of chi even if we were to acquiesce in these decisions we

should have accounted only for a small part of the work it is best to rest

in the general conclusion that it was compiled by the disciples of the

disciples of the sage making free use of the written memorials concerning

him which they had received and the oral statements which they had

heard from their several masters  and we shall not be far wrong if we

determine its date as about the end of the fourth or the beginning of the

fifth century before christ

 in the critical work on the four books called record of remarks in

the village of yung  it is observed the analects in my opinion were

made by the disciples just like a record of remarks there they were

recorded and afterwards came a firstrate hand who gave them the

beautiful literary finish which we now witness so that there is not a

character which does not have its own indispensable place  we have

seen that the first of these statements contains only a small amount of

truth with regard to the materials of the analects nor can we receive the

second if one hand or one mind had digested the materials provided by

many the arrangement and the style of the work would have been

different we should not have had the same remark appearing in several

books with little variation and sometimes with none at all nor can we

account on this supposition for such fragments as the last chapters of the

ninth tenth and sixteenth books and many others no definite plan has

been kept in view throughout a degree of unity appears to belong to some

books more than others and in general to the first ten more than to those

which follow but there is no progress of thought or illustration of subject

from book to book and even in those where the chapters have



   the village of yung is i conceive the writers nom

de plume

      


a common subject they are thrown together at random more than on

any plan

 we cannot tell when the work was first called the lun yu  the

evidence in the preceding section is sufficient to prove that when the han

scholars were engaged in collecting the ancient books it came before them

not in broken tablets but complete and arranged in books or sections as

we now have it the old copy was found deposited in the wall of the house

which confucius had occupied and must have been placed there not later

than bc  distant from the date which i have assigned to the

compilation not much more than a century and a half that copy written

in the most ancient characters was possibly the autograph of the

compilers

we have the writings or portions of the writings of several authors of

the third and fourth centuries before christ of these in addition to the

great learning the doctrine of the mean and the works of mencius i

have looked over the works of hsun ching  of the orthodox school of

the philosophers chwang and lieh of the taoist school  and of the

heresiarch mo 

in the great learning commentary chapter iv we have the words of

ana xii xiii in the doctrine of the mean ch iii we have ana vi xxvii

and in ch xxviii  we have substantially ana iii ix in mencius ii pt i

ii  we have ana vii xxxiii and in vii  ana iv i in iii pt i iv 

ana viii xviii xix in iv pt i xiv  ana xi xvi  in v pt ii vii 

ana x xiii  and in vii pt ii xxxvii    ana v xxi xiii xxi and

xvii xiii these quotations however are introduced by the master said

or confucius said no mention being made of any book called the lun yu

or analects in the great learning commentary x  we have the words

of ana iv iii and in



 in the continuation of the general examination of records and

scholars  bk cxcviii p  it is said indeed on the authority of

wang chung  a scholar of our first century that when the work

came out of the wall it was named a chwan or record  and that it was

when kung ankwo instructed a native of tsin named fuching in it that

it first got the name of lun yu   

  if it were so it is strange the circumstance is not

mentioned in ho yens preface

 

  

 
mencius iii pt ii vii  those of ana xvii i but without any notice of

quotation

in the writings of hsun ching book i page  we find something like

the words of ana xv xxx and on p  part of xiv xxv but in these

instances there is no mark of quotation

in the writings of chwang i have noted only one passage where the

words of the analects are reproduced ana xviii v is found but with

large additions and no reference of quotation in his treatise on man in the

world associated with other men  in all those works as well as in

those of lieh and mo the references to confucius and his disciples and to

many circumstances of his life are numerous  the quotations of sayings

of his not found in the analects are likewise many especially in the

doctrine of the mean in mencius and in the works of chwang those in the

latter are mostly burlesques but those by the orthodox writers have more

or less of classical authority some of them may be found in the chia yu 

or narratives of the school and in parts of the li chi while others are

only known to us by their occurrence in these writings altogether they

do not supply the evidence for which i am in quest of the existence of the

analects as a distinct work bearing the name of the lun yu prior to the

chin dynasty they leave the presumption however in favour of those

conclusions which arises from the facts stated in the first section

undisturbed they confirm it rather they show that there was abundance

of materials at hand to the scholars of han to compile a much larger work

with the same title if they had felt it their duty to do the business of

compilation and not that of editing



section iii

of commentaries upon the analects


 it would be a vast and unprofitable labor to attempt to give a list of

the commentaries which have been published on this work my object is

merely to point out how zealously the business of interpretation was

undertaken as soon as the text had been



 

 in mos chapter against the literati he mentions some of the

characteristics of confucius in the very words of the tenth book of the

analects

 
recovered by the scholars of the han dynasty and with what industry it

has been persevered in down to the present time

 mention has been made in section i  of the lun of prince chang

published in the half century before our era pao hsien  a distinguished

scholar and officer f the reign of kwangwu  the first emperor of the

eastern han dynasty ad  and another scholar of the surname chau

 less known but of the same time published works containing

arrangements of this in chapters and sentences with explanatory notes

the critical work of kung ankwo on the old lun yu has been referred to

that was lost in consequence of suspicions under which ankwo fell

towards the close of the reign of the emperor wu but in the time of the

emperor shun ad  another scholar ma yung  undertook the

exposition of the characters in the old lun giving at the same time his

views of the general meaning the labors of chang hsuan in the second

century have been mentioned not long after his death there ensued a

period of anarchy when the empire was divided into three governments

well known from the celebrated historical romance called the three

kingdoms the strongest of them the house of wei patronized literature

and three of its high officers and scholars chan chun wang su and chau

shanglieh  in the first half and probably the second quarter of the

third century all gave to the world their notes on the analects

very shortly after five of the great ministers of the government of wei

sun yung chang chung tsao hsi hsun kai and ho yen  united in the

production of one great work entitled a collection of explanations of the

lun yu  it embodied the labors of all the writers which have been

mentioned and having been frequently reprinted by succeeding

dynasties it still remains the preface of the five compilers in the form of

a memorial to the emperor so called of the house of wei is published

with it and has been of much assistance to me in writing these sections ho



 

 

 

    

      

           

    

  i possess a copy of this work printed about the middle of our

fourteenth century
yen was the leader among them and the work is commonly quoted as if

it were the production of him alone

 from ho yen downwards there has hardly been a dynasty which has

not contributed its laborers to the illustration of the analects in the liang

which occupied the throne a good part of the sixth century there appeared

the comments of hwang kan  who to the seven authorities cited by ho

yen added other thirteen being scholars who had deserved well of the

classic during the intermediate time passing over other dynasties we

come to the sung ad  an edition of the classics was published

by imperial authority about the beginning of the eleventh century with

the title of the correct meaning the principal scholar engaged in the

undertaking was hsing ping  the portion of it on the analects  is

commonly reprinted in the thirteen classics after ho yens explanations

but the names of the sung dynasty are all thrown into the shade by that of

chu hsi than whom china has not produced a greater scholar he

composed or his disciples complied in the twelfth century three works on

the analects the first called collected meanings  the second

collected comments  and the third queries  nothing could exceed

the grace and clearness of his style and the influence which he has exerted

on the literature of china has been almost despotic

the scholars of the present dynasty however seem inclined to question

the correctness of his views and interpretations of the classics and the

chief place among them is due to mao chiling  known by the local

name of hsiho  his writings under the name of the collected works of

hsiho  have been published in eighty volumes containing between

three and four hundred books or sections he has nine treatises on the four

books or parts of them and deserves to take rank with chang hsuan and

chu hsi at the head of chinese scholars though he is a vehement opponent

of the latter most of his writings are to be found also in the great work

called a collection of works on the classics under the imperial dynasty of

ching  which contains  sections and is a noble contribution by

the scholars of the present dynasty to the illustration of its ancient

literature



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
section iv

of various readings
in the collection of supplementary observations on the four books 

the second chapter contains a general view of commentaries on the

analects and from it i extract the following list of various readings of the

text found in the comments of chang hsuan and referred to in the first

section of this chapter



book ii i  for  viii  for  xix  for  xxiii   without 

for  book iii vii in the clause  he makes a full stop at 

xxi   for  book iv x  for  and  for  book v xxi he puts a full

stop at  book vi vii he has not the characters  book vii iv  for 

 xxxiv  simply for  book ix ix  for  book xi xxv   for 

 and  for  book xiii iii   for  xviii   for  book xiv xxxi

 for  xxxiv   for  book xv i a  for 

book xvi i   for  book xvii i  for  xxiv   for  book

xviii iv  for  viii   for 



these various readings are exceedingly few and in themselves

insignificant the student who wishes to pursue this subject at length is

provided with the means in the work of ti chiaoshau  expressly

devoted to it it forms sections  of the works of the classics

mentioned at the close of the preceding section a still more

comprehensive work of the same kind is the examination of the text of

the classics and of commentaries on them published under the

superintendence of yuan yuan forming chapters  to  of the same

collection chapters  to  are occupied with the lun yu see the

reference to yuan yuan farther on on p

chapter iii

of the great learning



section i

history of the text and the different arrangements of it which have

been proposed
 it has already been mentioned that the great learning frms one of

the books of the li chi or record of rites the formation of the text of

which will be treated of in its proper place i will only say here that the

records of rites had suffered much more after the death of confucius

than the other ancient classics which were supposed to have been collected

and digested by him they were in a more dilapidated condition at the

time of the revivial of the ancient literature under the han dynasty and

were then published in three collections only one of which  the record of

rites  retains its place among the five ching

the record of rites consists according to the ordinary arrangement of

fortynine chapters or books liu hsiang see ch i sect ii  took the lead

in its formation and was followed by the two famous scholars tai teh 

and his relative tai shang  the first of these reduced upwards of 

chapters collected by hsiang to eightynine and shang reduced these

again to fortysix the three other books were added in the second century

of our era the great learning being one of them by ma yung mentioned

in the last chapter section iii  since his time the work has not received

any further additions

 in his note appended to what he calls the chapter of classical text

chu hsi says that the tablets of the old copies of the rest of the great

learning were considerably out of order by those old copies he intends

the work of chang hsuan who published his commentary on the classic

soon after it was completed by the additions of ma yung and t is possible

that the tablets were in confusion and had not been arranged with

sufficient care but such a thing does not appear to have been suspected

until the



 

  shang was a second cousin of teh
twelfth century nor can any evidence from ancient monuments be

adduced in its support

i have related how the ancient classics were cut on slabs of stone by

imperial order ad  the text being that which the various literati had

determined and which had been adopted by chang hsuan the same work

was performed about seventy years later under the socalled dynasty of

wei between the years  and  and the two sets of slabs were set up

together the only difference between them was that whereas the classics

had been cut in the first instance only in one form the characters in the

slabs of wei were in three different forms amd the changes of dynasties

the slabs both of han and wei had perished or nearly so before the rise of

the tang dynasty ad  but under one of its emperors in the year

 a copy of the classics was again cut on stone though only in one form

of the character these slabs we can trace down through the sung dynasty

when they were known as the tablets of shen  they were in exact

conformity with the text of the classics adopted by chang hsuan in his

commentaries and they exist at the present day at the city of hsian

shenhsi still called by the same name

the sung dynasty did not accomplish a similar work itself nor did

either of the two which followed it think it necessary to engrave in stone

in this way the ancient classics about the middle of the sixteenth century

however the literary world in china was startled by a reprt that the slabs

of wei which contained the great learning had been discovered but this

was nothing more than the result f an impudent attempt at an imposition

for which it is difficult to a foreigner to assign any adequate cause the

treatise as printed from these slabs has some trifling additions and many

alterations in the order of the text but differing from the arrangements

proposed by chu hsi and by other scholars there seems to be now no

difference of opinion among chinese critics that the whole affair was a

forgery the text of the great learning as it appears in the record of rites

with the commentary of chang hsuan and was thrice engraved on stone in

three different dynasties is no doubt that which was edited in the han

dynasty by ma yung

 i have said that it is possible that the tablets containing the



 
text were not arranged with sufficient care by him and indeed any one

who studies the treatise attentively will probably come to the conclusion

that the part of it forming the first six chapters of commentary in the

present work is but a fragment it would not be a difficult task to propose

an arrangement of the text different from any which i have yet seen but

such an undertaking would not be interesting out of china my object here

is simply to mention the chinese scholars wh have rendered themselves

famous or notorious in their own country by what they hav done in this

way the first was chang hao a native of loyang in honan province in

the eleventh century  his designation of poshun but since his death he

has been known chiefly by the style of mingtao  which we may render

the wiseindoctrine the eulogies heaped on him by chu hsi and others

are extravagant and he is placed immediately after mencious in the list of

great scholars doubtless he was a man of vast literary acquirements the

greatest change which he introduced into the great learning was to read

sin  for chin  at the commencement making the second

object proposed in the treatise to be the renovation of the people

instead of loving them this alteration and his various transpositions

of the text are found in mao hsihos treatise on the attested text of the

great learning 

hardly less illustrious than chang hao was his younger brother chang

i known by the style of changshu  and since his death by that of

ichwan  he followed hao in the adoption of the reading to

renovate instead of to love but he transposed the text

differently more akin to the arrangement afterwards made by chu hsi

suggesting also that there were some superfluous sentences in the old text

which might conveniently be erased the work as proposed to be read by

him will be found in the volume of mao just referred to

we come to the name of chu hsi who entered into the labors of the

brothers chang the young of whom he styles his master in his

introductory note to the great learning his arrangement of the text is that

now current in all the editions of the four books and it had nearly

displaced the ancient text



 

 

 

 

 

 

 
altogether the sanction of imperial approval was given to it during the

yuan and ming dynasties in the editions of the five ching published

by them only the names of the doctrine of the mean and the great

learning were preserved no text of these books was given and hsiho

tells us that in the reign of chiaching  the most flourishing period of

the ming dynasty ad  when wang wanchang  published

a copy of the great learning taken from the tang edition of the thirteen

ching all the officers and scholars looked at one another in

astonishment and were inclined to supposed that the work was a forgery

besides adopting the reading of sin for chin from the chang

and modifying their arrangements of the text chu hsi made other

innovations he first divided the whole into one chapter of classical text

which he assigned to confucius and then chapters of commentary which

he assigned to the disciple tsang previous to him the whole had been

published indeed without any specification of chapters and paragraphs

he undertook moreover to supply one whole chapter which he supposed

after his master chang to be missing

since the time of chu hsi many scholars have exercised their wit on the

great learning  the work of mao hsiho contains four arrangements of the

text proposed respectively by the scholars wang luchai  chi pang

shan  kao chingyi  and ko chichan  the curious student may

examine them here

under the present dynasty the tendency has been to depreciate the

labors of chu hsi the integrity of the text of chang hsuan is zealously

maintained and the simpler method of interpretation employed by him is

advocated in preference to the more refined and ingenious schemes of the

sung scholars  i have referred several times in the notes to a work

published a few years ago under the title of the old text of the sacred

ching with commentary and discussions by lo chungfan of nanhai

 i knew the man many years ago he was a fine scholar and had taken

the second degree or that of chuzan he applied to me in  for

christian baptism and offended by my hesitancy went and enrolled

himself among the disciples of another missionary he soon however



 

 

 

 

 

 

 
withdrew into seclusion and spent the last years of his life in literary

studies his family have published the work on the great learning and

one or two others he most vehemently impugns nearly every judgment of

chu hsi but in his own exhibitions of the meaning he blends many ideas of

the supreme being and of the condition of human nature which he had

learned from the christian scriptures



section ii

of the authorship and distinction of the text into classical text and

commentary
 the authorship of the great learning is a very doubtful point and

one on which it does not appear possible to come to a decided conclusion

chu hsi as i have stated in the last section determined that so much of it

was ching or classic being the very words of confucius and that all

the rest was chwan or commentary being the views of tsang shan

upon the sages words recorded by his disciples thus he does not

expressly attribute the composition of the treatise to tsang as he is

generally supposed to do what he says however as it is destitute of

external support is contrary also to the internal evidence the fourth

chapter of commentary commences with the master said surely if there

were anything more directly from confucius there would be an intimation

of it in the same way or if we may allow that short sayings of confucius

might be interwoven with the work as in the fifteenth paragraph of the

tenth chapter without referring them expressly to him it is too much to

ask us to receive the long chapter at the beginning as being from him with

regard to the work having come from the disciples of tsang shan

recording their masters views the paragraph in chapter sixth

commencing with the disciple tsang said seems to be conclusive against

such an hypothesis so much we may be sure is tsangs and no more both

of chu hsis judgments must be set aside we cannot admit either the

distinction of the contents into classical text and commentary or that the

work was the production of tsangs disciples

 who then was the author an ancient tradition attributes it to kung

chi the grandson of confucius in a notice published at the time of their

preparation about the stone slabs of wei the



following statement by chia kwei a noted scholar of the first century is

found when kung chi was living and in straits in sung being afraid

lest the lessons of the former sages should become obscure and the

principles of the ancient sovereigns and kings fall to the ground he

therefore made the great learning as the warp of them and the doctrine

of the mean as the woof  this would seem therefore to have been the

opinion of that early time and i may say the only difficulty in admitting it

is that no mention is made of it by chang hsuan there certainly is that

agreement between the two treatises which makes their common

authorship not at all unlikely

 though we cannot positively assign the authorship of the great

learning there can be no hesitation in receiving it as a genuine monument

of the confucian school there are not many words in it from the sage

himself but it is a faithful reflection of his teachings written by some of

his followers not far removed from him by lapse of time it must

synchronize pretty nearly with the analects and may be safely referred to

the fifth century before our era



section iii

its scope and value
 the worth of the great learning has been celebrated in most

extravagant terms by chinese writers and there have been foreigners who

have not yielded to them in their estimation of it pauthier in the

argument philosphique prefixed to his translation of the work says it

is evident that the aim of the chinese philosopher is to exhibit the duties of

political government as those of the perfecting of self and of the practice

of virtue by all men he felt that he had a higher mission than that with

which the greater part of ancient and modern philosophers have contented

themselves and his immense love for the happiness of humanity which

dominated over all his other sentiments has made of his





 

 see the  p 
philosophy a system of social perfectionating which we venture to say

has never been equalled

very different is the judgment passed upon the treatise by a writer in

the chinese repository the ta hsio is a short politicomoral

discourse ta hsio or superior learning is at the same time both

the name and the subject of the discourse it is the summum bonum

of the chinese in opening this book compiled by a disciple of confucius

and containing his doctrines we might expect to find a work like ciceros

de officiis but we find a very different production consisting of a

few commonplace rules for the maintenance of a good government 

my readers will perhaps think after reading the present section that

the truth lies between these two representations

 i believe that the book should be styled tai hsio  and not

ta hsio and that it was so named as setting forth the higher and

more extensive principles of moral science which come into use and

manifestation in the conduct of government when chu shi endeavours to

make the title mean  the principles of learning which were taught in

the higher schools of antiquity and tells us how at the age of fifteen all

the sons of the sovereign with the legitimate sons of the nobles and high

officers down to the more promising scions of the common people all

entered these seminaries and were taught the difficult lessons here

inculcated we pity the ancient youth of china such strong meat is not

adapted for the nourishment of youthful minds but the evidence adduced

for the existence of such educational institutions in ancient times is

unsatisfactory and from the older interpretation of the title we advance

more easily to contemplate the object and method of the work

 the object is stated definitely enough in the opening paragraph

what the great learning teaches is  to illustrate illustrious virtue to

love the people and to rest in the highest excellence the political aim of

the writer is here at once evident he has before him on one side the

people the masses of the empire and over against them are those

whose work and duty delegated by heaven is to govern them

culminating as a class in the son of heaven  the one man  the

sovereign from the fourth and



 chinese repository vol iii p 

  not  see the note on the title of the work below

  cl classical text par  

  comm ix 
fifth paragraphs we see that if the lessons of the treatise be learned

and carried into practice the result will be that illustrious virtue will be

illustrated throughout the nation which will be brought through all its

length and breadth to a condition of happy tranquillity this object is

certainly both grand and good annd if a reasonable and likely method to

secure it were proposed in the work language would hardly supply terms

adequate to express its value

 but the above account of the object of the great learning leads us to

the conclusion that the student of it should be a sovereign  what interest

can an ordinary man have in it it is high up in the clouds far beyond his

reach this is a serious objection to it and quite unfits it for a place in

schools such as chu hsi contends it once had intelligent chinese whose

minds were somewhat quickened by christianity have spoken to me of

this defect and complained of the difficulty they felt in making the book a

practical directory for their conduct it is so vague and vast was the

observation of one man the writer however has made some provision for

the general application of his instructions he tells us that from the

sovereign down to the mass of the people all must consider the cultivation

of the person to be the root that is the first thing to be attended to  as

in his method moreover he reaches from the cultivation of the person to

the tranquillization of the kingdom through the intermediate steps of the

regulation of the family and the government of the state  there is room

for setting forth principles that parents and rulers generally may find

adapted for their guidance

 the method which is laid down for the attainment of the great object

proposed consists of seven steps the investigation of things the

completion of knowledge the sincerity of the thoughts the rectifying of

the heart the cultivation of the person the regulation of the family and

the government of the state these form the steps of a climax the end of

which is the kingdom tranquillized pauthier calls the paragraphs where

they occur instances of the sorites or abridged syllogism but they elong to

rhetoric and not to logic

 in offering some observations on these steps and the writers

treatment of them it will be well to separate them into those preceding

the cultivation of the person and those following it and to



  cl text par 

  cl text pars  
deal with the latter first  let us suppose that the cultivation of the

person is fully attained every discordant mental element having been

subdued and removed it is assumed that the regulation of the family will

necessarily flow from this two short paragraphs are all that are given to

the illustration of the point and they are vague generalities on the subject

of mens being led astray by their feelings and affections

the family being regulated there will result from it the government of

the state first the virtues taught in the family have their

correspondencies in the wider sphere filial piety will appear as loyalty

fraternal submission will be seen in respect and obedience to elders and

superiors kindness is capable of universal application second from the

loving example of one family a whole state becomes loving and from its

courtesies the whole state become courteous  seven paragraphs suffice

to illustrate these statements and short as they are the writer goes back

to the topic of selfcultivation returning from the family to the individual

the state being governed the whole empire will become peaceful and

happy there is even less of connexion however in the treatment of this

theme between the premiss and the conclusion than in the two previous

chapters nothing is said about the relation between the whole kingdom

and its component states or any one of them it is said at once what is

meant by the making the whole kingdom peaceful and happy depends on

the government of the state is this when the sovereign behaves to his

aged as the aged should be behaved to the people become filial when the

sovereign behaves to his elders as elders should be behaved to the people

learn brotherly submission when the sovereign treats compassionately the

young and helpless the people do the same  this is nothing but a

repetition of the preceding chapter instead of that chapters being made a

step from which to go on to the splendid consummation of the good

government of the whole kingdom

the words which i have quoted are followed by a very striking

enunciation of the golden rule in its negative form and under the name of

the measuring square and all the lessons of the chapter are

connected more or less closely with that the application of this principle

by a ruler whose heart is in the first place in loving sympathy with the

people will guide him in all the exactions which



  see comm ix 

  see comm x 
he lays upon them and in his selection of ministers in such a way that

he will secure the affections of his subjects and his throne will be

established for by gaining the people the kingdom is gained and by

losing the people the kingdom is lost  there are in this part of the

treatise many valuable sentiments and counsels for all in authority over

others the objection to it is that as the last step of the climax it does not

rise upon all the others with the accumulated force of their conclusions

but introduces us to new principles of action and a new line of argument

cut off the commencement of the first paragraph which connects it with

the preceding chapters and it would form a brief but admirable treatise

by itself on the art of government

this brief review of the writers treatment of the concluding steps of his

method will satisfy the reader that the execution is not equal to the design

and moreover underneath all the reasoning and more especially apparent

in the eighth and ninth chapters of commentary according to the ordinary

arrangement of the work there lies the assumption that example is all but

omnipotent we find this principle pervading all the confucian philosophy

and doubtless it is a truth most important in education and government

that the influence of example is very great i believe and will insist upon

it hereafter in these prolegomena that we have come to overlook this

element in our conduct of administration it will be well if the study of the

chinese classics should call attention to it yet in them the subject is

pushed to an extreme and represented in an extravagant manner

proceeding from the view of human nature that it is entirely good and led

astray only by influences from without the sage of china and his followers

attribute to personal example and to instruction a power which we do not

find that they actually possess

 the steps which precede the cultivation of the person are more

briefly dealt with than those which we have just considered the

cultivation of the person results from the rectifying of the heart or mind

 true but in the great learning very inadequately set forth

the rectifying of the mind is realized when the thoughts are made

sincere  and the thoughts are sincere when no selfdeception is

allowed and we move without effort to what is right and wrong as we

love what is beautiful and as we dislike a bad

smell  how are we to attain this state here the chinese moralist

fails us according to chu hsis arrangement of the treatise there is only

one sentence from which we can frame a reply to the above question

therefore it is said the superior man must be watchful over himself

when he is alone  following chus sixth chapter of commentary and

forming we may say part of it we have in the old arrangement of the

great learning all the passages which he has distributed so as to form the

previous five chapters but even from the examination of them we do not

obtain the information which we desire on this momentous inquiry

 indeed the more i study the work the more satisfied i become that

from the conclusion of what is now called the chapter of classical text to

the sixth chapter of commentary we have only a few fragments which it

is of no use trying to arrange so as fairly to exhibit the plan of the author

according to his method the chapter on the connexion between making

the thoughts sincere and so rectifying the mental nature should be

preceded by one on the completion of knowledge as the means of making

the thoughts sincere and that again by one on the completion of

knowledge by the investigation of things or whatever else the phrase ko

wu may mean i am less concerned for the loss and injury which this

part of the work has suffered because the subject of the connexion

between intelligence and virtue is very fully exhibited in the doctrine of

the mean and will come under our notice in the review of that treatise

the manner in which chu hsi has endeavoured to supply the blank about

the perfecting of knowledge by the investigation of things is too

extravagant the learning for adults he says at the outset of its lessons

instructs the learner in regard to all things in the world to proceed from

what knowledge he has of their principles and pursue his investigation of

them till he reaches the extreme point after exerting himself for a long

time he will suddenly find himself possessed of a wide and farreaching

penetration then the qualities of all things whether external or internal

the subtle or the coarse will be apprehended and the mind in its entire

substance and its relations to things will be perfectly intelligent this is

called the investigation of things this is called the perfection of knowledge

 and knowledge must be thus perfected before we can achieve the

sincerity of our thoughts and the rectifying of our hearts

verily this would be learning not for adults only but even methuselahs

would not be able to compass it yet for centuries this has been accepted as

the orthodox exposition of the classic lo chungfan does not express

himself too strongly when he says that such language is altogether

incoherent the author would only be imposing on himself and others

 the orthodox doctrine of china concerning the connexion between

intelligence and virtue is most seriously erroneous but i will not lay to the

charge of the author of the great learning the wild representations of the

commentator of our twelfth century nor need i make here any remarks on

what the doctrine really is after the exhibition which i have given my

readers will probably conclude that the work before us is far from

developing as pauthier asserts a system of social perfectionating which

has never been equalled

 the treatise has undoubtedly great merits but they are not to be

sought in the severity of its logical processes or the largeminded

prosecution of any course of thought we shall find them in the

announcement of certain seminal principles which if recognised in

government and the regulation of conduct would conduce greatly to the

happiness and virtue of mankind i will conclude these observations by

specifying four such principles

first the writer conceives nobly of the object of government that it is

to make its subjects happy and good this may not be a sufficient account

of that object but it is much to have it so clearly laid down to all kings and

governors that they are to love the people ruling not for their own

gratification but for the good of those over whom they are exalted by

heaven very important also is the statement that rulers have no divine

right but what springs from the discharge of their duty the decree does

not always rest on them goodness obtains it and the want of goodness

loses it 

second the insisting on personal excellence in all who have authority in

the family the state and the kingdom is a great moral and social principle

the influence of such personal excellence may be overstated but by the

requirement of its cultivation the writer deserved well of his country

third still more important than the requirement of such excellence is

the principle that it must be rooted in the state of



 comm x 
the heart and be the natural outgrowth of internal sincerity as a man

thinketh in his heart so is he this is the teaching alike of solomon and the

author of the great learning

fourth i mention last the striking exhibition which we have of the

golden rule though only in its negative form what a man dislikes in his

superiors let him not display in the treatment of his inferiors what he

dislikes in inferiors let him not display in his service of his superiors what

he dislikes in those who are before him let him not therewith precede

those who are behind him what he dislikes in those who are behind him

let him not therewith follow those who are before him what he dislikes to

receive on the right let him not bestow on the left what he dislikes to

receive on the left let him not bestow on the right this is what is called

the principle with which as with a measuring square to regulate ones

conduct  the work which contains those principles cannot be thought

meanly of they are commonplace as the writer in the chinese repository

calls them but they are at the same time eternal verities

the doctrine of the mean



section i

its place in the li chi and its publication separately
 the doctrine of the mean was one of the treatises which came to light

in connexion with the labors of liu hsiang and its place as the thirtyfirst

book in the li chi was finally determined by ma yung and chang hsuan in

the translation of the li chi in the sacred books of the east it is the

twentyeighth treatise

 but while it was thus made to form a part of the great collection of

treatises on ceremonies it maintained a separate footing of its own in liu

hsins catalogue of the classical works we find two pien of

observations on the chung yung l in the records of the dynasty of sui

ad  in the chapter on the history of literature  there are

mentioned three works on the chung yung the first called the record of

the chung yung in two chuan attributed to tai yung a scholar who

flourished about the middle of the fifth century the second a paraphrase

and commentary on the chung yung attributed to the emperor wu ad

 of the liang dynasty in one chuan  and the third a

private record determining the meaning of the chung yung in five

chuan the author or supposed author of which is not mentioned 

it thus appears that the chung yung had been published and

commented on separately long before the time of the sung dynasty the

scholars of that however devoted special attention to it the way being led

by the famous chau lienchi  he was followed by the two brothers

chang but neither of them published upon it at last came chu hsi who

produced his work called



 

  p 

 

 
the chung yung in chapters and sentences  which was made the

text book of the classic at the literary examinations by the fourth emperor

of the yuan dynasty ad  and from that time the name

merely of the treatise was retained in editions of the li chi neither text

nor ancient commentary was given

under the present dynasty it is not so in the superb edition of the

three li ching edited by numerous committees of scholars towards

the middle of the chienlung reign the chung yung is published in two

parts the ancient commentaries from the thirteen ching being

given side by side with those of chu hsi



section ii

its author and some account of him
 the composition of the chung yung is attributed to kung chi the

grandson of confucius  chinese inquirers and critics are agreed on this

point and apparently on sufficient grounds there is indeed no internal

evidence in the work to lead us to such a conclusion among the many

quotations of confuciuss words and references to him we might have

expected to find some indication that the sage was the grandfather of the

author but nothing of the kind is given the external evidence however

or that from the testimony of authorities is very strong in szema chiens

historical records published about bc  it is expressly said that tsze

sze made the chung yung and we have a still stronger proof a century

earlier from tszeszes own descendant kung fu whose words are tsze

sze compiled the chung yung in fortynine pien  we may

therefore accept the received account without hesitation

 as chi spoken of chiefly by his designation of tszesze thus occupies

a distinguished place in the classical literature of china it



 

  see the 

 this kung fu  was that descendant of confucius who hid several

books in the wall of his house on the issuing of the imperial edict for their

burning he was a writer himself and his works are referred to under the

title of  i have not seen them but the statement given above is

found in the  art   
may not be out of place to bring together here a few notices of him

gathered from reliable sources

he was the son of li whose death took place bc  four years before

that of the sage his father i have not found it recorded in what year he

was born szema chien says he died at the age of  but this is evidently

wrong for we learn from mencius that he was high in favour with the

duke mu of lu  whose accession to that principality dates in bc 

seventy years after the death of confucius in the plates and notices of the

worthies sacrificed to in the sages temples  it is supposed that the

sixtytwo in the historical records should be eightytwo  it is

maintained by others that tszeszes life was protracted beyond  years

 this variety of opinions simply shows that the point cannot be

positively determined to me it seems that the conjecture in the sacrificial

canon must be pretty near the truth 

during the years of his boyhood then tszesze must have been with his

grandfather and received his instructions it is related that one day when

he was alone with the sage and heard him sighing he went up to him and

bowing twice inquired the reason of his grief is it said he because you

think that your descendants through not cultivating themselves will be

unworthy of you or is it that in your admiration of the ways of yao and

shun you are vexed that you fall short of them child replied confucius

how is it that you know my thoughts i have often said tszesze heard

from you the lesson that when the father has gathered and prepared the

firewood if the son cannot carry the bundle he is to be pronounced

degenerate and unworthy the remark comes frequently into my thoughts

and fills me with great apprehensions the sage was delighted he



 or 

 

  eightytwo and sixtytwo may more easily be

confounded as written in chinese than with the roman figures

 see the  on the preface to the chung yung  

 li himself was born in confuciuss twentyfirst year and if tszesze had

been born in lis twentyfirst year he must have been  at the time of

duke mus accession but the tradition is that tszesze was a pupil of tsang

shan who was born bc  we must place his birth therefore

considerably later and suppose him to have been quite young when his

father died i was talking once about the question with a chinese friend

who observed li was fifty when he died and his wife married again

into a family of wei we can hardly think therefore that she was anything

like that age li could not have married so soon as his father did perhaps

he was about forty when chi was born
smiled and said now indeed shall i be without anxiety my

undertakings will not come to naught they will be carried on and flourish

 after the death of confucius chi became a pupil it is said of the

philosopher tsang but he received his instructions with discrimination

and in one instance which is recorded in the li chi the pupil suddenly took

the place of the master we there read tsang said to tszesze chi when i

was engaged in mourning for my parents neither congee nor water

entered my mouth for seven days tszesze answered in ordering their

rules of propriety it was the design of the ancient kings that those who

would go beyond them should stoop and keep by them and that those who

could hardly reach them should stand on tiptoe to do so thus it is that the

superior man in mourning for his parents when he has been three days

without water or congee takes a staff to enable himself to rise 

while he thus condemned the severe discipline of tsang tszesze

appears in various incidents which are related of him to have been

himself more than sufficiently ascetic as he was living in great poverty a

friend supplied him with grain which he readily received another friend

was emboldened by this to send him a bottle of spirits but he declined to

receive it you receive your corn from other people urged the donor and

why should you decline my gift which is of less value you can assign no

ground in reason for it and if you wish to show your independence you

should do so completely i am so poor was the reply as to be in want

and being afraid lest i should die and the sacrifices not be offered to my

ancestors i accept the grain as an alms but the spirits and the dried flesh

which you offer to me are the appliances of a feast for a poor man to be

feasting is certainly unreasonable this is the ground of my refusing your

gift i have no thought of asserting my independence 

to the same effect is the account of tszesze which we have from liu

hsiang that scholar relates when chi was living in wei he wore a

tattered coat without any lining and in thirty days had only nine meals

tien tszefang having heard of his



 see the  in the place just quoted from for the incident we are

indebted to kung fu see note  p 

 li chi ii sect i ii 

 see the  as above
distress sent a messenger to him with a coat of foxfur and being

afraid that he might not receive it he added the message when i

borrow from a man i forget it when i give a thing i part with it freely as

if i threw it away tszesze declined the gift thus offered and when tsze

fang said i have and you have not why will you not take it he replied

you give away as rashly as if you were casting your things into a ditch

poor as i am i cannot think of my body as a ditch and do not presume to

accept your gift  tszeszes mother married again after lis death into

a family of wei but this circumstance which is not at all creditable in

chinese estimation did not alienate his affections from her he was in lu

when he heard of her death and proceeded to weep in the temple of his

family a disciple came to him and said your mother married again into

the family of the shu and do you weep for her in the temple of the kung

i am wrong said tszesze i am wrong and with these words he went to

weep elsewhere 

in his own married relation he does not seem to have been happy and

for some cause which has not been transmitted to us he divorced his wife

following in this it has been wrongly said the example of confucius on

her death her son tszeshang  did not undertake any mourning for

her tszeszes disciples were surprised and questioned him did your

predecessor a superior man they asked mourn for his mother who had

been divorced yes was the reply then why do you not cause pai  to

mourn for his mother tszesze answered my progenitor a superior man

failed in nothing to pursue the proper path his observances increased or

decreased as the case required but i cannot attain to this while she was

my wife she was pais mother when she ceased to be my wife she ceased

to be pais mother the custom of the kung family not to mourn for a

mother who had been divorced took its rise from tszesze 

these few notices of kung chi in his more private relations bring him

before us as a man of strong feeling and strong will independent and with

a tendency to asceticism in his habits



 see the  as above

 see the li chi ii sect ii iii   must be understood as i have

done above and not with chang hsuan  your mother was born a miss

shu

   this was the designation of tszeszes son

  this was tszeshangs name

 see the li chi ii sect i i 
as a public character we find him at the ducal courts of wei sung lu

and pi and at each of them held in high esteem by the rulers to wei he

was carried probably by the fact of his mother having married into that

state we are told that the prince of wei received him with great

distinction and lodged him honourably on one occasion he said to him an

officer of the state of lu you have not despised this small and narrow wei

but have bent your steps hither to comfort and preserve it vouchsafe to

confer your benefits upon me tszesze replied if i should wish to requite

your princely favour with money and silks your treasuries are already full

of them and i am poor if i should wish to requite it with good words i

am afraid that what i should say would not suit your ideas so that i

should speak in vain and not be listened to the only way in which i can

requite it is by recommending to your notice men of worth the duke

said men of worth are exactly what i desire nay said chi you are not

able to appreciate them nevertheless was the reply i should like to

hear whom you consider deserving that name tszesze replied do you

wish to select your officers for the name they may have or for their

reality for their reality certainly said the duke his guest then said in

the eastern borders of your state there is one li yin who is a man of real

worth what were his grandfather and father asked the duke they

were husbandmen was the reply on which the duke broke into a loud

laugh saying  i do not like husbandry the son of a husbandman cannot

be fit for me to employ i do not put into office all the cadets of those

families even in which office is hereditary tszesze observed i mention

li yin because of his abilities what has the fact of his forefathers being

husbandmen to do with the case and moreover the duke of chau was a

great sage and kangshu was a great worthy yet if you examine their

beginnings you will find that from the business of husbandry they came

forth to found their states i did certainly have my doubts that in the

selection of your officers you did not have regard to their real character

and capacity with this the conversation ended the duke was silent 

tszesze was naturally led to sung as the kung family originally sprang

from that principality one account quoted in the



 see the 
four books text and commentary with proofs and illustrations 

says that he went thither in his sixteenth year and having foiled an officer

of the state named yo so in a conversation on the shu ching his opponent

was so irritated at the disgrace put on him by a youth that he listened to

the advice of evil counsellors and made an attack on him to put him to

death the duke of sung hearing the tumult hurried to the rescue and

when chi found himself in safety he said when king wan was imprisoned

in yuli he made the yi of chau my grandfather made the chun chiu

after he had been in danger in chan and tsai shall i not make something

when rescued from such a risk in sung upon this he made the chung

yung in fortynine pien

according to this account the chung yung was the work of tszeszes

early manhood and the tradition has obtained a wonderful prevalence

the notice in the sacrificial canon says on the contrary that it was the

work of his old age when he had finally settled in lu which is much more

likely 

of tszesze in pi which could hardly be said to be out of lu we have

only one short notice in mencius v pt ii iii  where the duke hui of pi

is introduced as saying i treat tszesze as my master

we have fuller accounts of him in lu where he spent all the latter

years of his life instructing his disciples to the number of several hundred

 and held in great reverence by the duke mu the duke indeed wanted

to raise him to the highest office but he declined this and would only

occupy the position of a guide philosopher and friend of the attention

which he demanded however instances will he found in mencius ii pt ii

xi  v pt ii vi  and vii  in his intercourse with the duke he spoke

the truth to him fearlessly in the cyclopaedia of surnames  i find the

following conversations but i cannot tell from what source they are

extracted into that work one day the duke said to tszesze the officer

hsien told me that you do good without



 this is the work so often referred to as the  the full title

being  the passage here translated from it will be found in the

place several times referred to in this section

 the author of the  adopts the view that the work was

composed in sung some have advocated this from ch xxviii  compared

with ana iii ix it being proper they say that tszesze writing in sung

should not depreciate it as confucius had done out of it

 see in the sacrificial canon on tszesze

 this is the work referred to in note  p 
wishing for any praise from men is it so tszesze replied no that

is not my feeling when i cultivate what is good i wish men to know it for

when they know it and praise me i feel encouraged to be more zealous in

the cultivation this is what i desire and am not able to obtain if i

cultivate what is good and men do not know it it is likely that in their

ignorance they will speak evil of me so by my gooddoing i only come to

be evil spoken of this is what i do not desire but am not able to avoid in

the case of a man who gets up at cockcrowing to practise what is good

and continues sedulous in the endeavour till midnight and says at the

same time that he does not wish men to know it lest they should praise

him i must say of such a man that if he be not deceitful he is stupid

another day the duke asked tszesze saying can my state be made to

flourish it may was the reply and how tszesze said o prince if you

and your ministers will only strive to realize the government of the duke

of chau and of pochin practising their transforming principles sending

forth wide the favours of your ducal house and not letting advantages

flow in private channels if you will thus conciliate the affections of the

people and at the same time cultivate friendly relations with neighboring

states your state will soon begin to flourish

on one occasion the duke asked whether it had been the custom of old

for ministers to go into mourning for a prince whose service and state they

had left tszesze replied to him of old princes advanced their ministers

to office according to propriety and dismissed them in the same way and

hence there was that rule but nowadays princes bring their ministers

forward as if they were going to take them on their knees and send them

away as if they would cast them into an abyss if they do not treat them as

their greatest enemies it is well how can you expect the ancient practice

to be observed in such circumstances 

these instances may suffice to illustrate the character of tszesze as it

was displayed in his intercourse with the princes of his time we see the

same independence which he affected in private life and a dignity not

unbecoming the grandson of confucius but we miss the reach of thought

and capacity for administration which belonged to the sage it is with him

how



 this conversation is given in the li chi ii sect ii pt ii 
ever as a thinker and writer that we have to do and his rank in that

capacity will appear from the examination of the chung yung in the section

iv below his place in the temples of the sage has been that of one of his

four assessors since the year  he ranks with yen hui tsang shan

and mencius and bears the title of the philosopher tszesze transmitter

of the sage 



section iii

its integrity
in the testimony of kung fu which has been adduced to prove the

authorship of the chung yung it is said that the work consisted originally

of fortynine pien from this statement it is argued by some that the

arrangement of it in thirtythree chapters which originated with chu hsi

is wrong  but this does not affect the question of integrity and the

character pien is so vague and indefinite that we cannot affirm that

kung fu meant to tell us by it that tszesze himself divided his treatise

into so many paragraphs or chapters



it is on the entry in liu hsins catalogue quoted section i two

pien of observations on the chung yung that the integrity of the

present work is called in question yen szeku of the tang dynasty has a

note on that entry to the effect there is now the chung yung in the li

chi in one pien but that is not the original treatise here mentioned

but only a branch from it  wang wei a writer of the ming dynasty

says anciently the chung yung consisted of two pien as appears

from the history of literature of the han dynasty but in the li chi we

have only one pien which chu hsi when he made his chapters and

sentences divided into thirtythree chapters the old work in two

pien is not to be met with now 

these views are based on a misinterpretation of the entry in the



 

 see the  art 

 

 


catalogue it does not speak of two pien of the chung yung but of

two pien of observations thereon the great learning

carries on its front the evidence of being incomplete but the student will

not easily believe that the doctrine of the mean is so i see no reason for

calling its integrity in question and no necessity therefore to recur to the

ingenious device employed in the edition of the five ching published

by the imperial authority of kang hsi to get over the difficulty which

wang wei supposes it there appears in two pien of which we have

the following account from the author of supplemental remarks upon the

four books the proper course now is to consider the first twenty

chapters in chu hsis arrangement as making up the first pien and

the remaining thirteen as forming the second in this way we retain the

old form of the treatise and do not come into collision with the views of

chu for this suggestion we are indebted to lu wangchai an author of

the sung dynasty  



section iv

its scope and value
 the doctrine of the mean is a work not easy to understand it first

says the philosopher chang speaks of one principle it next spreads this

out and embraces all things finally it returns and gathers them up under

the one principle unroll it and it fills the universe roll it up and it retires

and lies hid in secrecy  there is this advantage however to the student

of it that more than most other chinese treatises it has a beginning a

middle and an end the first chapter stands to all that follows in the

character of a text containing several propositions of which we have the

expansion or development if that development were satisfactory we

should be able to bring our own minds en rapport with that of the

author unfortunately it is not so as a writer he belongs to the intuitional

school more than to the logical this is well put in the continuation of the

general examination of literary monuments and learned men the

philosopher tsang reached his conclusions by following in the train of

things watch



 see the  art 

 see the introductory note of chu hsi
ing and examining whereas tszesze proceeds directly and reaches to

heavenly virtue his was a mysterious power of discernment approaching

to that of yen hui  we must take the book and the author however as

we have them and get to their meaning if we can by assiduous

examination and reflection

 man has received his nature from heaven conduct in

accordance with that nature constitutes what is right and true is a

pursuing of the proper path the cultivation or regulation of that

path is what is called instruction it is with these axioms that the

treatise commences and from such an introduction we might expect that

the writer would go on to unfold the various principles of duty derived

from an analysis of mans moral constitution

confining himself however to the second axiom he proceeds to say that

the path may not for an instant be left and that the superior man is

cautious and careful in reference to what he does not see and fearful and

apprehensive in reference to what he does not hear there is nothing more

visible than what is secret and nothing more manifest than what is

minute and therefore the superior man is watchful over his

aloneness this is not all very plain comparing it with the sixth

chapter of commentary in the great learning it seems to inculcate what is

there called making the thoughts sincere the passage contains an

admonition about equivalent to that of solomon keep thy heart with all

diligence for out of it are the issues of life

the next paragraph seems to speak of the nature and the

path under other names while there are no movements of pleasure

anger sorrow or joy we have what may be called the state of

equilibrium when those feelings have been moved and they all act

in the due degree we have what may be called the state of harmony

this equilibrium is the great root of the world and this harmony is its

universal path what is here called the state of equilibrium is the same

as the nature given by heaven considered absolutely in itself without

deflection or inclination this nature acted on from without and

responding with the various emotions so as always to hit  the mark

with entire



 see the  bk cxcix art 



 
correctness produces the state of harmony and such harmonious

response is the path along which all human activities should proceed

finally let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection

and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth and all things

will be nourished and flourish here we pass into the sphere of mystery

and mysticism the language according to chu hsi describes the

meritorious achievements and transforming influence of sage and spiritual

men in their highest extent from the path of duty where we tread on

solid ground the writer suddenly raises us aloft on wings of air and will

carry us we know not where and to we know not what

 the paragraphs thus presented and which constitute chu hsis first

chapter contain the sum of the whole work this is acknowledged by all

by the critics who disown chu hsis interpretations of it as freely as by

him  revolving them in my own mind often and long i collect from

them the following as the ideas of the author firstly man has received

from heaven a moral nature by which he is constituted a law to himself

secondly over this nature man requires to exercise a jealous watchfulness

and thirdly as he possesses it absolutely and relatively in perfection or

attains to such possession of it he becomes invested with the highest

dignity and power and may say to himself i am a god yea i sit in the

seat of god i will not say here that there is impiety in the last of these

ideas but do we not have in them the same combination which we found

in the great learning a combination of the ordinary and the

extraordinary the plain and the vague which is very perplexing to the

mind and renders the book unfit for the purposes of mental and moral

discipline

and here i may inquire whether we do right in calling the treatise by

any of the names which foreigners have hitherto used for it in the note

on the title i have entered a little into this question the work is not at all

what a reader must expect to find in what he supposes to be a treatise on

the golden medium the invariable mean or the doctrine of the mean

those



l compare chu hsis language in his concluding note to the first chapter

 and mao hsihos in his   p  


names are descriptive only of a portion of it where the phrase chung

yung occurs in the quotations from confucius in nearly every chapter

from the second to the eleventh we do well to translate it by the course of

the mean or some similar terms but the conception of it in tszeszes

mind was of a different kind as the preceding analysis of the first chapter

sufficiently shows 

 i may return to this point of the proper title for the work again but

in the meantime we must proceed with the analysis of it the ten

chapters from the second to the eleventh constitute the second part and in

them tszesze quotes the words of confucius for the purpose according

to chu hsi of illustrating the meaning of the first chapter yet as i have

just intimated they do not to my mind do this confucius bewails the rarity

of the practice of the mean and graphically sets forth the difficulty of it

the empire with its component states and families may be ruled

dignities and emoluments may be declined naked weapons may be

trampled under foot but the course of the mean can not be attained to 

the knowing go beyond it and the stupid do not come up to it  yet

some have attained to it shun did so humble and ever learning from

people far inferior to himself  and yen hui did so holding fast whatever

good he got hold of and never letting it go  tszelu thought the mean

could be taken by storm but confucius taught him better  and in fine

it is only the sage who can fully exemplify the mean 

all these citations do not throw any light on the ideas presented in the

first chapter on the contrary they interrupt the train of thought instead

of showing us how virtue or the path of duty is in accordance with our

heavengiven nature they lead us to think of it as a mean between two

extremes each extreme may be a violation of the law of our nature but

that is not made to appear confuciuss sayings would be in place in

illustrating the doctrine of the peripatetics which placed all virtue in a

medium between opposite vices  here in the chung yung of tszesze i

have always felt them to be out of place

 in the twelfth chapter tszesze speaks again himself and we seem at

once to know the voice he begins by saying that the way of the superior

man reaches far and wide and yet is



 in the version in the sacred books of the east i call the treatise the

state of equilibrium and harmony

secret by which he means to tell us that the path of duty is to be

pursued everywhere and at all times while yet the secret spring and rule

of it is near at hand in the heavenconferred nature the individual

consciousness with which no stranger can intermeddle chu hsi as will be

seen in the notes gives a different interpretation of the utterance but the

view which i have adopted is maintained convincingly by mao hsiho in

the second part of his observations on the chung yung with this chapter

commences the third part of the work which embraces also the eight

chapters which follow it is designed says chu hsi to illustrate what is

said in the first chapter that the path may not be left but more than that

one sentence finds its illustration here tszesze had reference in it also to

what he had said the superior man does not wait till he sees things to

be cautious nor till he hears things to be apprehensive there is nothing

more visible than what is secret and nothing more manifest than what is

minute therefore the superior man is watchful over himself when he is

alone it is in this portion of the chung yung that we find a good deal of

moral instruction which is really valuable most of it consists of sayings of

confucius but the sentiments of tszesze himself in his own language are

interspersed with them the sage of china has no higher utterances than

those which are given in the thirteenth chapter the path is not far from

man when men try to pursue a course which is far from the common

indications of consciousness this course cannot be considered the

path in the book of poetry it is said
in hewing an axehandle in hewing an axehandle

the pattern is not far off
we grasp one axehandle to hew the other and yet if we look askance

from the one to the other we may consider them as apart therefore the

superior man governs men according to their nature with what is proper

to them and as soon as they change what is wrong he stops when one

cultivates to the utmost the moral principles of his nature and exercises

them on the principle of reciprocity he is not far from the path what you

do not like when done to yourself do not do to others

in the way of the superior man there are four things to none of which

have i as yet attained to serve my father as i would require my son to

serve me to this i have not attained to serve





my elder brother as i would require my younger brother to serve me

to this i have not attained to serve my ruler as i would require my

minister to serve me to this i have not attained to set the example in

behaving to a friend as i would require him to behave to me to this i have

not attained earnest in practising the ordinary virtues and careful in

speaking about them if in his practice he has anything defective the

superior man dares not but exert himself and if in his words he has any

excess he dares not allow himself such license thus his words have

respect to his actions and his actions have respect to his words is it not

just an entire sincerity which marks the superior man

we have here the golden rule in its negative form expressly

propounded what you do not like when done to yourself do not do to

others but in the paragraph which follows we have the rule virtually in

its positive form confucius recognises the duty of taking the initiative of

behaving himself to others in the first instance as he would that they

should behave to him there is a certain narrowness indeed in that the

sphere of its operations seems to be confined to the relations of society

which are spoken of more at large in the twentieth chapter but let us not

grudge the tribute of our warm approbation to the sentiments

this chapter is followed by two from tszesze to the effect that the

superior man does what is proper in every change of his situation always

finding his rule in himself and that in his practice there is an orderly

advance from step to step from what is near to what is remote then

follow five chapters from confucius the first on the operation and

influence of spiritual beings to show the manifestness of what is minute

and the irrepressibleness of sincerity the second on the filial piety of

shun and how it was rewarded by heaven with the throne with enduring

fame and with long life the third and fourth on the kings wan and wu

and the duke of chau celebrating them for their filial piety and other

associate virtues and the fifth on the subject of government these

chapters are interesting enough in themselves but when i go back from

them and examine whether i have from them any better understanding of

the paragraphs in the first chapter which they are said to illustrate i do

not find that i have three of them the seventeenth eighteenth and

nineteenth would be more in place in the classic of filial piety than here

in the chung yung the meaning of the





sixteenth is shadowy and undefined after all the study which i have

directed to it there are some points in reference to which i have still

doubts and difficulties

the twentieth chapter which concludes the third portion of the work

contains a full exposition of confuciuss views on government though

professedly descriptive only of that of the kings wan and wu along with

lessons proper for a ruler there are many also of universal application but

the mingling of them perplexes the mind it tells us of the five duties of

universal application those between sovereign and minister husband

and wife father and son elder and younger brother and friends of the

three virtues by which those duties are carried into effect namely

knowledge benevolence and energy and of the one thing by which those

virtues are practised which is singleness or sincerity  it sets forth in

detail the nine standard rules for the administration of government

which are the cultivation by the ruler of his own character the honouring

men of virtue and talents affection to his relatives respect towards the

great ministers kind and considerate treatment of the whole body of

officers cherishing the mass of the people as children encouraging all

classes of artisans indulgent treatment of men from a distance and the

kindly cherishing of the princes of the states  there are these and

other equally interesting topics in this chapter but as they are in the

work they distract the mind instead of making the authors great object

more clear to it and i will not say more upon them here

 doubtless it was the mention of singleness or sincerity in the

twentieth chapter which made tszesze introduce it into this treatise for

from those terms he is able to go on to develop what he intended in saying

that if the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection a happy

order will prevail throughout heaven and earth and all things will be

nourished and flourish it is here that now we are astonished at the

audacity of the writers assertions and now lost in vain endeavours to

ascertain his meaning i have quoted the words of confucius that it is

singleness by which the three virtues of knowledge benevolence and

energy are able to carry into practice the duties of universal obligation he

says also that it is this same singleness by which the nine standard rules

of government can be effectively carried out  this singleness is merely

a name for the states of equilibrium

and harmony existing in perfection it denotes a character absolutely

and relatively good wanting nothing in itself and correct in all its

outgoings sincerity is another term for the same thing and in speaking

about it confucius makes a distinction between sincerity absolute and

sincerity acquired the former is born with some and practised by them

without any effort the latter is attained by study and practised by strong

endeavour  the former is the way of heaven the latter is the way of

men  he who possesses sincerity absolutely that is is he who

without effort hits what is right and apprehends without the exercise of

thought he is the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way

he who attains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good and firmly

holds it fast and to this attainment there are requisite the extensive study

of what is good accurate inquiry about it careful reflection on it the clear

discrimination of it and the earnest practice of it  in these passages

confucius unhesitatingly enunciates his belief that there are some men

who are absolutely perfect who come into the world as we might conceive

the first man was when he was created by god in his own image full of

knowledge and righteousness and who grow up as we know that christ

did increasing in wisdom and in stature he disclaimed being considered

to be such an one himself  but the sages of china were such and

moreover others who are not so naturally may make themselves to

become so some will have to put forth more effort and to contend with

greater struggles but the end will be the possession of the knowledge and

the achievement of the practice

i need not say that these sentiments are contrary to the views of

human nature which are presented in the bible the testimony of

revelation is that there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and

sinneth not if we say that we have no sin and in writing this term i am

thinking here not of sin against god but if we can conceive of it apart

from that of failures in regard to what ought to be in our regulation of

ourselves and in our behavior to others if we say that we have no sin

we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us this language is

appropriate in the lips of the learned as well as in those of the ignorant to

the highest sage as to the lowest child of the soil neither the scriptures of

god nor the experience of man know of individuals

absolutely perfect the other sentiment that men can make themselves

perfect is equally wide of the truth intelligence and goodness by no means

stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect the sayings of ovid

video meliora proboque deteriora sequor nitimur in velitum semper

cupimusque negata are a more correct expression of the facts of

human consciousness and conduct than the highflown praises of

confucius

 but tszesze adopts the dicta of his grandfather without questioning

them and gives them forth in his own style at the commencement of the

fourth part of his treatise when we have intelligence resulting from

sincerity this condition is to be ascribed to nature when we have sincerity

resulting from intelligence this condition is to be ascribed to instruction

but given the sincerity and there shall be the intelligence given the

intelligence and there shall be the sincerity 

tszesze does more than adopt the dicta of confucius he applies them

in a way which the sage never did and which he would probably have

shrunk from doing the sincere or perfect man of confucius is he who

satisfies completely all the requirements of duty in the various relations of

society and in the exercise of government but the sincere man of tszesze

is a potency in the universe able to give its full development to his own

nature he can do the same to the nature of other men able to give its full

development to the nature of other men he can give their full

development to the natures of animals and things able to give their full

development to the natures of creatures and things he can assist the

transforming and nourishing powers of heaven and earth able to assist

the transforming and nourishing powers of heaven and earth he may with

heaven and earth form a ternion  such are the results of sincerity

natural the case below this  of sincerity acquired is as follows the

individual cultivates its shoots from these he can attain to the possession

of sincerity this sincerity becomes apparent from being apparent it

becomes manifest from being manifest it becomes brilliant brilliant it

affects others affecting others they are changed by it changed by it they

are transformed it is only he who is possessed of the most complete

sincerity that can exist under heaven who can transform  it may safely

be affirmed that when he thus expressed himself tszesze understood

neither what he said nor

whereof he affirmed mao hsiho and some other modern writers

explain away many of his predicates of sincerity so that in their hands

they become nothing but extravagant hyperboles but the author himself

would i believe have protested against such a mode of dealing with his

words true his structures are castles in the air but he had no idea

himself that they were so

in the twentyfourth chapter there is a ridiculous descent from the

sublimity of the two preceding we are told that the possessor of entire

sincerity is like a spirit and can foreknow but the foreknowledge is only a

judging by the milfoil and tortoise and other auguries but the author

recovers himself and resumes his theme about sincerity as conducting to

selfcompletion and the completion of other men and things describing it

also as possessing all the qualities which can be predicated of heaven and

earth gradually the subject is made to converge to the person of confucius

who is the ideal of the sage as the sage is the ideal of humanity at large

an old account of the object of tszesze in the chung yung is that he wrote

it to celebrate the virtue of his grandfather  he certainly contrives to do

this in the course of it the thirtieth thirtyfirst and thirtysecond

chapters contain his eulogium and never has any other mortal been

exalted in such terms he may be compared to heaven and earth in their

supporting and containing their overshadowing and curtaining all things

he may be compared to the four seasons in their alternating progress and

to the sun and moon in their successive shining quick in apprehension

clear in discernment of farreaching intelligence and allembracing

knowledge he was fitted to exercise rule magnanimous generous benign

and mild he was fitted to exercise forbearance impulsive energetic

strong and enduring he was fitted to maintain a firm hold selfadjusted

grave never swerving from the mean and correct he was fitted to

command reverence accomplished distinctive concentrative and

searching he was fitted to exercise discrimination allembracing and

vast he was like heaven deep and active as a fountain he was like the

abyss therefore his fame overspreads the middle kingdom and extends

to all barbarous tribes wherever ships and carriages reach wherever the

strength of man penetrates wherever the heavens overshadow



  see the  p 
and the earth sustains wherever the sun and moon shine wherever

frosts and dews fall all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honour

and love him hence it is said he is the equal of heaven who can know

him but he who is indeed quick in apprehension clear in discernment of

farreaching intelligence and allembracing knowledge possessing all

heavenly virtue

 we have arrived at the concluding chapter of the work in which the

author according to chu hsi having carried his descriptions to the highest

point in the preceding chapters turns back and examines the source of his

subject and then again from the work of the learner free from all

selfishness and watchful over himself when he is alone he carries out his

description till by easy steps he brings it to the consummation of the

whole world tranquillized by simple and sincere reverentialness he

moreover eulogizes its mysteriousness till he speaks of it at last as without

sound or smell  between the first and last chapters there is a

correspondency and each of them may be considered as a summary of the

whole treatise the difference between them is that in the first a

commencement is made with the mention of heaven as the conferrer of

mans nature while in this the progress of man in virtue is traced step by

step till at last it is equal to that of high heaven

 i have thus in the preceding paragraphs given a general and

somewhat copious review of this work my object has been to seize if i

could the train of thought and to hold it up to the reader minor objections

to it arising from the confused use of terms and singular applications of

passages from the older classics are noticed in the notes subjoined to the

translation i wished here that its scope should be seen and the means be

afforded of judging how far it is worthy of the high character attributed to

it the relish of it says the younger chang is inexhaustible the whole of

it is solid learning when the skilful reader has explored it with delight till

he has apprehended it he may carry it into practice all his life and will

find that it cannot be exhausted 

my own opinion of it is less favourable the names by which it has been

called in translations of it have led to misconceptions of its character were

it styled the states of equilibrium and harmony we should be prepared

to expect something strange and probably extravagant assuredly we

should expect nothing more



 see the concluding note by chu hsi

 see the introductory note below
strange or extravagant than what we have it begins sufficiently well

but the author has hardly enunciated his preliminary apophthegms when

he conducts into an obscurity where we can hardly grope our way and

when we emerge from that it is to be bewildered by his gorgeous but

unsubstantial pictures of sagely perfection he has eminently contributed

to nourish the pride of his countrymen he has exalted their sages above

all that is called god or is worshipped and taught the masses of the people

that with them they have need of nothing from without in the meantime

it is antagonistic to christianity byandby when christianity has

prevailed in china men will refer to it as a striking proof how their fathers

by their wisdom knew neither god nor themselves

confucius and his immediate disciples



section i

life of confucius


 and have you foreigners surnames as well this question has often

been put to me by chinese it marks the ignorance which belongs to the

people of all that is external to



sidebar his ancestry



themselves and the pride of antiquity which enters largely as an

element into their character if such a pride could in any case be justified

we might allow it to the family of the kung the descendants of confucius

in the reign of kanghsi twentyone centuries and a half after the death

of the sage they amounted to eleven thousand males but their ancestry is

carried back through a period of equal extent and genealogical tables are

common in which the descent of confucius is traced down from hwangti

in whose reign the cycle was invented bc  

the more moderate writers however content themselves with

exhibiting his ancestry back to the commencement of the chau dynasty

bc  among the relatives of the tyrant chau the last emperor of the

yin dynasty was an elder brother by a concubine named chi  who is

celebrated by confucius ana xviii i under the title of the viscount of

wei foreseeing the impending ruin of their family chi withdrew from the

court and subsequently he was invested by the emperor chang the

second of the house of chau with the principality of sung which embraced

the eastern portion of the present province of honan that he might there

continue the sacrifices to the sovereigns of yin chi was followed as duke

of sung by a younger brother in whose line the succession continued his

greatgrandson the duke min  was



l see mmoires concernant les chinois tome xii p  et seq

father amiot states p  that he had seen the representative of the

family who succeeded to the dignity of  in the ninth year of chien

lung ad  the last duke not the present was visited in our own time

by the late dr williamson and mr consul markham it is hardly necessary

that i should say here that the name confucius is merely the chinese

characters  kung futsze the master kung latinized

 

 
followed bc  by a younger brother leaving however two sons

fufu ho  and fangsze  fu ho  resigned his right to the dukedom

in favour of fangsze who put his uncle to death in bc  and became

master of the state he is known as the duke li  and to his elder brother

belongs the honour of having the sage among his descendants

three descents from fu ho we find chang kaofu  who was a

distinguished officer under the dukes tai wu and hsuan  bc 

 he is still celebrated for his humility and for his literary tastes we

have accounts of him as being in communication with the grand

historiographer of the kingdom and engaged in researches about its

ancient poetry thus setting an example of one of the works to which

confucius gave himself  kao gave birth to kungfu chia  from whom

the surname of kung took its rise five generations had now elapsed since

the dukedom was held in the direct line of his ancestry and it was

according to the rule in such cases that the branch should cease its

connexion with the ducal stem and merge among the people under a new

surname kung chia was master of the horse in sung and an officer of

wellknown loyalty and probity unfortunately for himself he had a wife

of surpassing beauty of whom the chief minister of the state by name

hwa tu  happened on one occasion to get a glimpse determined to

possess her he commenced a series of intrigues which ended bc  in

the murder of chia and of the ruling duke shang  at the same time tu

secured the person of the lady and hastened to his palace with the prize

but on the way she had strangled herself with her girdle

an enmity was thus commenced between the two families of kung and

hwa which the lapse of time did not obliterate and the latter being the

more powerful of the two chias greatgrandson withdrew into the state of

lu to avoid their persecution there he was appointed commandant of the

city of fang  and is known

appears in the history of the times as a soldier of great prowess and daring

bravery in the year bc  when serving at the siege of a place called

pehyang  a party of the assailants made their way in at a gate which

had purposely been left open and no sooner were they inside than the

portcullis was dropped heh was just entering and catching the massive

structure with both his hands he gradually by dint of main strength raised

it and held it up till his friends had made their escape

thus much on the ancestry of the sage doubtless he could trace his

descent in the way which has been indicated up to the imperial house of

yin nor was there one among his ancestors during the rule of chau to

whom he could not refer with satisfaction they had been ministers and

soldiers of sung and lu all men of worth and in chang kao both for his

humility and literary researches confucius might have special

complacency

 confucius was the child of shuliang hehs old age the soldier had

married in early life but his wife brought him only

daughters to the number of nine and no son by a concubine he had a

son named mangpi and also poni  who proved a cripple so that

when he was over seventy years heh sought a second wife in the yen

family  from which came subsequently yen hui the favourite disciple of

his son there were three daughters in the family the youngest being

named changtsai  their father said to them here is the commandant

of tsau his father and grandfather were only scholars but his ancestors

before them were descendants of the sage sovereigns he is a man ten feet

high  and of extraordinary prowess and i am very desirous of his

alliance though he is old and austere you need have no misgivings about

him which of you three will be his wife the two elder daughters were

silent but changtsai said why do you ask us father it is for you to

determine very well said her father in reply you will do changtsai

accordingly became hehs wife and in due time gave



 

 

 

 

  

 

 

   see on the length of the ancient foot ana viii vi but the

point needs a more sifting investigation than it has yet received
birth to confucius who received the name of chiu and was

subsequently styled chungni  the event happened on the twentyfirst

day of the tenth month of the twentyfirst year of the duke hsiang of lu

being the twentieth year of the emperor ling bc   the birthplace

was in the district of tsau  of which heh was the governor it was

somewhere within the limits of the present department of yenchau in

shantung but the honour of being the exact spot is claimed for two places

in two different districts of the department

the notices which we have of confuciuss early years are very scanty

when he was in his third year his father died it is related of him that as a

boy he used to play at the arrangement of



   the legends say that changtsai fearing lest she should

not have a son in consequence of her husbands age privately ascended

the nichiu hill to pray for the boon and that when she had obtained it

she commemorated the fact in the names  chiu and chungni but the

cripple mangpi had previous been styled poni there was some reason

previous to confuciuss birth for using the term ni in the family as

might be expected the birth of the sage is surrounded with many

prodigious occurrences one account is that the husband and wife prayed

together for a son in a dell of mount ni as changtsai went up the hill the

leaves of the trees and plants all erected themselves and bent downwards

on her return that night she dreamt the black ti appeared and said

to her you shall have a son a sage and you must bring him forth in a

hollow mulberry tree one day during her pregnancy she fell into a

dreamy state and saw five old men in the hall who called themselves the

essences of the five planets and led an animal which looked like a small

cow with one horn and was covered with scales like a dragon this

creature knelt before changtsai and cast forth from its mouth a slip of

jade on which was the inscription the son of the essence of water shall

succeed to the decaying chau and be a throneless king changtsai tied a

piece of embroidered ribbon about its horn and the vision disappeared

when heh was told of it he said the creature must be the chilin as her

time drew near changtsai asked her husband if there was any place in

the neighborhood called the hollow mulberry tree he told her there was a

dry cave in the south hill which went by that name then she said i will

go and be confined there her husband was surprised but when made

acquainted with her former dream he made the necessary arrangements

on the night when the child was born two dragons came and kept watch

on the left and right of the hill and two spiritladies appeared in the air

pouring out fragrant odors as if to bathe changtsai and as soon as the

birth took place a spring of clear warm water bubbled up from the floor of

the cave which dried up again when the child had been washed in it the

child was of an extraordinary appearance with a mouth like the sea ox

lips a dragons back c c on the top of his head was a remarkable

formation in consequence of which he was named chiu c see the 

bk lxxviiiszema chien seems to make confucius to have been

illegitimate saying that heh and miss yen cohabited in the wilderness 

 chiang yung says that the phrase has reference simply to the disparity of

their ages

 szema chien says that confucius was born in the twentysecond year of

duke hsiang bc  he is followed by chu hsi in the short sketch of

confuciuss life prefixed to the lun yu and by the annals of the empire

 published with imperial sanction in the reign of chiaching

to this latter work i have generally referred for my dates the year

assigned in the text above rests on the authority of kuliang and kung

yang the two commentators on the chunchiu with regard to the month

however the tenth is that assigned by kuliang while kungyang names

 tsau is written    and 
sacrificial vessels and at postures of ceremony of his schooling we have

no reliable account there is a legend indeed that at seven he went to

school to yen pingchung  but it must be rejected as pingchung

belonged to the state of chi he tells us himself that at fifteen he bent his

mind to learning  but the condition of the family was one of poverty at

a subsequent period when people were astonished at the variety of his

knowledge he explained it by saying when i was young my condition

was low and therefore i acquired my ability in many things but they

were mean matters 

when he was nineteen he married a lady from the state of sung of the

chienkwan family  and in the following year his son li was born on

the occasion of this event the duke chao sent him a present of a couple of

carp it was to signify his sense of his princes favour that he called his son

li the carp and afterwards gave him the designation of poyu 

fish primus no mention is made of the birth of any other children

though we know from ana v i that he had at least one daughter we

know also from an inscription on her grave that he had one other

daughter who died when she was quite young the fact of the duke of lus

sending him a gift on the occasion of lis birth shows that he was not

unknown but was already commanding public attention and the respect of

the great

it was about this time probably in the year after his marriage that

confucius took his first public employment as keeper of the stores of grain

 and in the following year he was put in charge of the public fields and

lands  mencius adduces these employments in illustration of his

doctrine that the superior man may at times take office on account of his

poverty but must confine himself in such a case to places of small

emolument and aim at nothing but the discharge of their humble duties

according to him confucius as keeper of stores said my calculations

must all be right that is all i have to care about and when in charge of

the public fields he said the oxen and sheep must be fat and strong and

subsequent words  show that the office was the same

 mencius calls this office  while szema chien says 
superior that is all i have to care about  it does not appear

whether these offices were held by confucius in the direct employment of

the state or as a dependent of the chi family in whose jurisdiction he

lived the present of the carp from the duke may incline us to suppose the

former

 in his twentysecond year confucius commenced his labors as a

public teacher and his house became a resort for young and inquiring

spirits who wished to learn the doctrines of antiquity



sidebar commencement of his labors as a teacher the death of

his mother bc 



however small the fee his pupils were able to afford he never refused

his instructions  all that he required was an ardent desire for

improvement and some degree of capacity i do not open up the truth he

said to one who is not eager to get knowledge nor help out any one who

is not anxious to explain himself when i have presented one corner of a

subject to any one and he cannot from it learn the other three i do not

repeat my lesson 

his mother died in the year bc  and he resolved that her body

should lie in the same grave with that of his father and that their common

restingplace should be in fang the first home of the kung in lu but here

a difficulty presented itself his fathers coffin had been for twenty years

where it had first been deposited off the road of the five fathers in

the vicinity of tsau would it be right in him to move it he was relieved

from this perplexity by an old woman of the neighborhood who told him

that the coffin had only just been put into the ground as a temporary

arrangement and not regularly buried on learning this he carried his

purpose into execution both coffins were conveyed to fang and put in the

ground together with no intervening space between them as was the

custom in some states and now came a new perplexity he said to himself

in old times they had graves but raised no tumulus over them but i am

a man who belongs equally to the north and the south the east and the

west i must have something by which i can remember the place

accordingly he raised a mound four feet high over the grave and

returned home leaving a party of his disciples to see everything properly

completed in the meantime there came on a heavy storm of rain and it

was a considerable time before the disciples joined him what makes you

so late he asked the grave in fang fell down they said he made no

reply and they repeated their

answer three times when he burst into tears and said ah they did

not make their graves so in antiquity  confucius mourned for his

mother the regular period of three years three years nominally but in

fact only twentyseven months five days after the mourning was expired

he played on his lute but could not sing it required other five days before

he could accompany an instrument with his voice 

some writers have represented confucius as teaching his disciples

important lessons from the manner in which he buried his mother and

having a design to correct irregularities in the ordinary funeral ceremonies

of the time these things are altogether without book we simply have a

dutiful son paying the last tribute of affection to a good parent in one

point he departs from the ancient practice raising a mound over the grave

and when the fresh earth gives way from a sudden rain he is moved to

tears and seems to regret his innovation this sets confucius vividly

before us a man of the past as much as of the present whose own

natural feelings were liable to be hampered in their development by the

traditions of antiquity which he considered sacred it is important

however to observe the reason which he gave for rearing the mound he

had in it a presentiment of much of his future course he was a man of the

north the south the east and the west he might not confine himself to

any one state he would travel and his way might be directed to some

wise ruler whom his counsels would conduct to a benevolent sway that

would break forth on every side till it transformed the empire

 when the mourning for his mother was over confucius remained in

lu but in what special capacity we do not know probably he continued to

encourage the resort of

ministers the sacrifices to the emperor shaohao the next in descent

from hwangti were maintained in tan so that the chief fancied that he

hearing about the matter waited on the visitor and learned from him all

that he had to communicate

referred his studying music under a famous master of the name of hsiang

 he was approaching his thirtieth year when as he tells us he stood 

firm that is in his convictions on the subjects of learning to which he had

bent his mind fifteen years before five years more however were still to

pass by before the anticipation mentioned in the conclusion of the last

paragraph began to receive its fulfillment  though we may conclude

from the way in which it was brought about that he was growing all the

time in the estimation of the thinking minds in his native state

in the twentyfourth year of duke chao bc  one of the principal

ministers of lu known by the name of mang hsi died seventeen years

before he had painfully felt his ignorance of ceremonial observances and

had made it his subsequent business to make himself acquainted with

them on his deathbed he addressed his chief officer saying a knowledge

of propriety is the stem of a man without it he has no means of standing

 the journey to chau is placed by szema chien before confuciuss

holding of his first official employments and chu hsi and most other

writers follow him it is a great error and arisen from a misunderstanding

of the passage from the  upon the subject
tell hochi to go and study proprieties under him  in consequence of

this charge hochi  mang hsis son who appears in the analects under

the name of mang i  and a brother or perhaps ony a near relative

named nankung changshu  became disciples of confucius their

wealth and standing in the state gave him a position which he had not had

before and he told changshu of a wish which he had to visit the court of

chau and especially to confer on the subject of ceremonies and music with

lao tan changshu represented the matter to the duke chao who put a

carriage and a pair of horses at confuciuss disposal for the expedition 

at this time the court of chau was in the city of lo  in the present

department of honan of the province of the same name the reigning

sovereign is known by the title of chang  but the sovereignty was little

more than nominal the state of china was then analogous to that of one of

the european kingdoms during the prevalence of the feudal system at the

commencement of the dynasty the various states of the kingdom had been

assigned to the relatives and adherents of the reigning family there were

thirteen principalities of greater note and a large number of smaller

dependencies during the vigorous youth of the dynasty the sovereign or

lord paramount exercised an effective control over the various chiefs but

with the lapse of time there came weakness and decay the chiefs 

corresponding somewhat to the european dukes earls marquises barons

c  quarrelled and warred among themselves and the stronger among

them barely acknowledged their subjection to the sovereign a similar

condition of things prevailed in each particular state there there sic

were hereditary ministerial families who were continually encroaching on

the authority of their rulers and the heads of those families again were

frequently hard pressed by their inferior officers such was the state of

china in confuciuss time the reader must have it clearly before him if he

would understand the position of the sage and the reforms which we shall

find it was subsequently his object to introduce

arrived at chau he had no intercourse with the court or any of



 see  

 

 

 

 the  makes changshu accompany confucius to chau it is difficult to

understand this if changshu were really a son of mang hsi who had died

that year

 

  bc 
the principal ministers he was there not as a politician but as an

inquirer about the ceremonies and maxims of the founders of the existing

dynasty lao tan  whom he had wished to see generally acknowledged

as the founder of the taoists or rationalistic sect so called which has

maintained its ground in opposition to the followers of confucius was then

a curator of the royal library they met and freely interchanged their

views but no reliable account of their conversations has been preserved

in the fifth book of the li chi which is headed the philosopher tsang

asked confucius refers four times to the views of laotsze on certain

points of funeral ceremonies and in the narratives of the school book

xxiv he tells chi kang what he had heard from him about the five tis

but we may hope their conversation turned also on more important

subjects szema chien favourable to laotsze makes him lecture his

visitor in the following style those whom you talk about are dead and

their bones are moldered to dust only their words remain when the

superior man gets his time he mounts aloft but when the time is against

him he moves as if his feet were entangled i have heard that a good

merchant though he has rich treasures deeply stored appears as if he

were poor and that the superior man whose virtue is complete is yet to

outward seeming stupid put away your proud air and many desires your

insinuating habit and wild will  these are of no advantage to you this

is all which i have to tell you on the other hand confucius is made to say

to his disciples i know how birds can fly how fishes can swim and how

animals can run but the runner may be snared the swimmer may be

hooked and the flyer may be shot by the arrow but there is the dragon i

cannot tell how he mounts on the wind through the clouds and rises to

heaven today i have seen laotsze and can only compare him to the

dragon 

while at lo confucius walked over the grounds set apart for the great

sacrifices to heaven and earth inspected the pattern of the hall of light

built to give audience in to the princes of the kingdom and examined all

the arrangements of the ancestral temple and the court from the whole he

received a profound



 according to szema chien tan was the posthumous epithet of this

individual whose surname was li  name r  and designation

 see the   and compare the remarks attributed to laotsze in

the account of the kung family near the beginning
impression now said he with a sigh i know the sage wisdom of the

duke of chau and how the house of chau attained to the royal sway 

on the walls of the hall of light were paintings of the ancient sovereigns

from yao and shun downwards their characters appearing in the

representations of them and words of praise or warning being appended

there was also a picture of the duke of chau sitting with his infant

nephew the king chang upon his knees to give audience to all the

princes confucius surveyed the scene with silent delight and then said to

his followers here you see how chau became so great as we use a glass to

examine the forms of things so must we study antiquity in order to

understand the present time  in the hall of the ancestral temple there

was a metal statue of a man with three clasps upon his mouth and his

back covered over with an enjoyable homily on the duty of keeping a

watch upon the lips confucius turned to his disciples and said observe it

my children these words are true and commend themselves to our

feelings 

about music he made inquiries at chang hung to whom the following

remarks are attributed i have observed about chungni many marks of

a sage he has river eyes and a dragon forehead the very characteristics

of hwangti his arms are long his back is like a tortoise and he is nine

feet six inches in height the very semblance of tang the completer

when he speaks he praises the ancient kings he moves along the path of

humility and courtesy he has heard of every subject and retains with a

strong memory his knowledge of things seems inexhaustible have we

not in him the rising of a sage 

i have given these notices of confucius at the court of chau more as

being the only ones i could find than because i put much faith in them he

did not remain there long but returned the same year to lu and

continued his work of teaching his fame was greatly increased disciples

came to him from different parts till their number amounted to three

thousand several of those who have come down to us as the most

distinguished among his followers however were yet unborn and the

statement just given may be considered as an exaggeration we are not to

conceive of the disciples as forming a community and living together

parties



   see the   art 

 quoted by chiang yung from the narratives of the school
of them may have done so we shall find confucius hereafter always

moving amid a company of admiring pupils but the greater number must

have had their proper avocations and ways of living and would only resort

to the master when they wished specially to ask his counsel or to learn of

him

 in the year succeeding the return to lu that state fell into great

confusion there were three families in it all connected irregularly with

the ducal house which had long kept the rulers in a condition of

dependency they appear frequently in the analects as the chi clan the

shu and the mang and while confucius freely spoke of their



sidebar he withdraws to chi and returns to lu the following

year bc  



usurpations  he was a sort of dependent of the chi family and

appears in frequent communication with members of all the three in the

year bc  the duke chao came to open hostilities with them and being

worsted fled into chi the state adjoining lu on the north thither

confucius also repaired that he might avoid the prevailing disorder of his

native state chi was then under the government of a ruler in rank a

marquis but historically called duke  afterwards styled ching  who

had a thousand teams each of four horses but on the day of his death the

people did not praise him for a single virtue  his chief minister

however was yen ying  a man of considerable ability and worth at his

court the music of the ancient sageemperor shun originally brought to

chi from the state of chan  was still preserved

according to the narratives of the school an incident occurred on the

way to chi which i may transfer to these pages as a good specimen of the

way in which confucius turned occurring matters to account in his

intercourse with his disciples as he was passing by the side of the tai

mountain there was a woman weeping and wailing by a grave confucius

bent forward in his carriage and after listening to her for some time sent

tszelu to ask the cause of her grief you weep as if you had experienced

sorrow upon sorrow said tszelu the woman replied it is so my

husbands father was killed here by a tiger and my husband also and now

my son has met the same fate confucius asked her why she did not

remove from the place and on her answering there is here no oppressive

government he turned to his disciples and said my



 see analects iii i ii et al

 

 ana xvi xii

  this is the same who was afterwards styled 

 
children remember this oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger



as soon as he crossed the border from lu we are told he discovered

from the gait and manners of a boy whom he saw carrying a pitcher the

influence of the sages music and told the driver of his carriage to hurry

on to the capital  arrived there he heard the strain and was so

ravished with it that for three months he did not know the taste of flesh

i did not think he said that music could have been made so excellent as

this  the duke ching was pleased with the conferences which he had

with him  and proposed to assign to him the town of linchiu from the

revenues of which he might derive a sufficient support but confucius

refused the gift and said to his disciples a superior man will only receive

reward for services which he has done i have given advice to the duke

ching but he has not yet obeyed it and now he would endow me with this

place very far is he from understanding me 

on one occasion the duke asked about government and received the

characteristic reply there is government when the ruler is ruler and the

minister is minister when the father is father and the son is son  i say

that the reply is characteristic once when tszelu asked him what he

would consider the first thing to be done if entrusted with the government

of a state confucius answered what is necessary is to rectify names 

the disciple thought the reply wide of the mark but it was substantially

the same with what he said to the marquis ching there is a sufficient

foundation in nature for government in the several relations of society

and if those be maintained and developed according to their relative

significancy it is sure to obtain this was a first principle in the political

ethics of confucius

another day the duke got to a similar inquiry the reply that the art of

government lay in an economical use of the revenues and being pleased

he resumed his purpose of retaining the philosopher in his state and

proposed to assign to him the fields of nichi his



 see the   art  i have translated however from the li

chi ii sect ii iii  where the same incident is given with some

variations and without saying when or where it occurred

 see the   p 

 ana vii xiii

 some of these are related in the narratives of the school about the

burning of the ancestral shrine of the sovereign  and a onefooted bird

which appeared hopping and flapping its wings in chi they are plainly

fabulous though quoted in proof of confuciuss sage wisdom this

reference to them is more than enough

 ana xiii iii
chief minister yen ying dissuaded him from the purpose saying those

scholars are impracticable and cannot be imitated they are haughty and

conceited of their own views so that they will not be content in inferior

positions they set a high value on all funeral ceremonies give way to

their grief and will waste their property on great burials so that they

would only be injurious to the common manners this mr kung has a

thousand peculiarities it would take generations to exhaust all that he

knows about the ceremonies of going up and going down this is not the

time to examine into his rules of propriety if you prince wish to employ

him to change the customs of chi you will not be making the people your

primary consideration 

i had rather believe that these were not the words of yen ying but they

must represent pretty correctly the sentiments of many of the statesmen

of the time about confucius the duke of chi got tired ere long of having

such a monitor about him and observed i cannot treat him as i would the

chief of the chi family i will treat him in a way between that accorded to

the chief of the chi and that given to the chief of the mang family finally

he said i am old i cannot use his doctrines  these observations were

made directly to confucius or came to his hearing  it was not consistent

with his selfrespect to remain longer in chi and he returned to lu 

 returned to lu he remained for the long period of about fifteen

years without being engaged in any official employment it



sidebar he remains without office in lu bc 



was a time indeed of great disorder the duke chao continued a refugee

in chi the government being in the hands of the great families up to his

death in bc  on which event the rightful heir was set aside and

another member of the ducal house known to us by the title of ting 

substituted in his place the ruling authority of the principality became

thus still more enfeebled than it had been before and on the other hand

the chiefs of the chi the shu and the mang could hardly keep their

ground against their own officers of those latter the two most conspicuous

were yang hu  called also yang ho  and



 see the   p 

 ana xviii iii

  szema chien makes the first observation to have been addressed

directly to confucius

 according to the above account confucius was only once and for a

portion of two years in chi for the refutation of contrary accounts see

chiang yungs life of the sage

 

 

 
kungshan fuzao  at one time chi hwan the most powerful of the

chiefs was kept a prisoner by yang hu and was obliged to make terms

with him in order to obtain his liberation confucius would give his

countenance to none as he disapproved of all and he studiously kept aloof

from them of how he comported himself among them we have a specimen

in the incident related in the analects xvii i yang ho wished to see

confucius but confucius would not go to see him on this he sent a present

of a pig to confucius who having chosen a time when ho was not at home

went to pay his respects for the gift he met him however on the way

come let me speak with you said the officer can he be called

benevolent who keeps his jewel in his bosom and leaves his country to

confusion confucius replied no can he be called wise who is anxious

to be engaged in public employment and yet is constantly losing the

opportunity of being so confucius again said no the other added the

days and months are passing away the years do not wait for us confucius

said right i will go into office chinese writers are eloquent in their

praises of the sage for the combination of propriety complaisance and

firmness which they see in his behavior in this matter to myself there

seems nothing remarkable in it but a somewhat questionable dexterity

but it was well for the fame of confucius that his time was not occupied

during those years with official services he turned them to better account

prosecuting his researches into the poetry history ceremonies and music

of the nation many disciples continued to resort to him and the legendary

writers tell us how he employed their services in digesting the results of

his studies i must repeat however that several of them whose names are

most famous such as tsang shan were as yet children and min sun 

was not born till bc 

to this period we must refer the almost single instance which we have

of the manner of confuciuss intercourse with his son li have you heard

any lessons from your father different from what we have all heard

asked one of the disciples once of li no said li he was standing alone

once when i was passing through the court below with hasty steps and

said to me have you learned the odes on my replying not yet he

added if you do not learn the odes you will not be fit to converse with

another day



  

 
in the same place and the same way he said to me have you read the

rules of propriety on my replying not yet he added if you do not

learn the rules of propriety your character cannot be established i have

heard only these two things from him the disciple was delighted and

observed i asked one thing and i have got three things i have heard

about the odes i have heard about the rules of propriety i have also

heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son



i can easily believe that this distant reserve was the rule which

confucius followed generally in his treatment of his son a stern dignity is

the quality which a father has to maintain upon his system it is not to be

without the element of kindness but that must never go beyond the line of

propriety there is too little room left for the play and development of

natural affection

the divorce of his wife must also have taken place during these years if

it ever took place at all which is a disputed point the curious reader will

find the question discussed in the notes on the second book of the li chi

the evidence inclines i think against the supposition that confucius did

put his wife away when she died at a period subsequent to the present

li kept on weeping aloud for her after the period for such a demonstration

of grief had expired when confucius sent a message to him that his sorrow

must be subdued and the obedient son dried his tears  we are glad to

know that on one occasion the death of his favourite disciple yen hui 

the tears of confucius himself would flow over and above the measure of

propriety 

 we come to the short period of confuciuss official life in the



sidebar he holds office bc 



year bc  things had come to a head between the chiefs of the three

families and their ministers and had resulted in the defeat of the latter in

that year the resources of yang hu were exhausted and he fled into chi so

that the state was delivered from its greatest troubler and the way was

made more clear for confucius to go into office should an opportunity

occur it soon presented itself towards the end of that year he was made

chief magistrate of the town of chungtu

 ana xi ix

  amiot says this was la ville meme ou le souverain tenoit sa cour

vie de confucius p  he is followed of course by thornton and

pauthier my reading has not shown me that such was the case in the

notes to kanghsis edition of the five ching li chi ii sect i iii  it is

simply said chungtu the name of a town of lu it afterwards

belonged to chi when it was called pinglu 
just before he received this appointment a circumstance occurred of

which we do not well know what to make when yanghu fled into chi

kungshan fuzao who had been confederate with him continued to

maintain an attitude of rebellion and held the city of pi against the chi

family thence he sent a message to confucius inviting him to join him and

the sage seemed so inclined to go that his disciple tszelu remonstrated

with him saying indeed you cannot go why must you think of going to

see kungshan confucius replied can it be without some reason that he

has invited me if any one employ me may i not make an eastern chau



the upshot however was that he did not go and i cannot suppose that

he had ever any serious intention of doing so amid the general gravity of

his intercourse with his followers there gleam out a few instances of quiet

pleasantry when he amused himself by playing with their notions about

him this was probably one of them

as magistrate of chungtu he produced a marvellous reformation of the

manners of the people in a short time according to the narratives of the

school he enacted rules for the nourishing of the living and all

observances to the dead different food was assigned to the old and the

young and different burdens to the strong and the weak males and

females kept apart from each other in the streets a thing dropped on the

road was not picked up there was no fraudulent carving of vessels inner

coffins were made four inches thick and the outer ones five graves were

made on the high grounds no mounds being raised over them and no

trees planted about them within twelve months the princes of the other

states all wished to imitate his style of administration 

the duke ting surprised at what he saw asked whether his rules could

be employed to govern a whole state and confucius told him that they

might be applied to the whole kingdom on this the duke appointed him

assistantsuperintendent of works  in which capacity he surveyed the

lands of the state and made many improvements in agriculture from this

he was quickly made minister of crime  and the appointment was

enough to put an end to crime there was no necessity to put the penal

laws in execution no offenders showed themselves 



 ana xvii v

  bk i

  this office however was held by the chief of the mang family we

must understand that confucius was only an assistant to him or perhaps

acted for him

 

  bk i
these indiscriminating eulogies are of little value one incident related

in the annotations of tsoshih on the chunchiu  commends itself at

once to our belief as in harmony with confuciuss character the chief of

the chi pursuing with his enmity the duke chao even after his death had

placed his grave apart from the graves of his predecessors and confucius

surrounded the ducal cemetery with a ditch so as to include the solitary

restingplace boldly telling the chief that he did it to hide his disloyalty

 but he signalized himself most of all in bc  by his behavior at an

interview between the dukes of lu and chi at a place called shihchi 

and chiaku  in the present district of laiwu in the department of

taian  confucius was present as master of ceremonies on the part of

lu and the meeting was professedly pacific the two princes were to form

a covenant of alliance the principal officer on the part of chi however

despising confucius as a man of ceremonies without courage had advised

his sovereign to make the duke of lu a prisoner and for this purpose a

band of the halfsavage original inhabitants of the place advanced with

weapons to the stage where the two dukes were met confucius understood

the scheme and said to the opposite party our two princes are met for a

pacific object for you to bring a band of savage vassals to disturb the

meeting with their weapons is not the way in which chi can expect to give

law to the princes of the kingdom these barbarians have nothing to do

with our great flowery land such vassals may not interfere with our

covenant weapons are out of place at such a meeting as before the

spirits such conduct is unpropitious in point of virtue it is contrary to

right as between man and man it is not polite the duke of chi ordered

the disturbers off but confucius withdrew carrying the duke of lu with

him the business proceeded notwithstanding and when the words of the

alliance were being read on the part of chi  so be it to lu if it

contribute not  chariots of war to the help of chi when its army goes

across its borders a messenger from confucius added and so be it to us

if we obey your orders unless you return to us the fields on the south of

the wan at the conclusion of the ceremonies the prince of chi wanted to

give a grand entertainment but confucius demonstrated that such a thing

would be



  

  bk i

 

 

  
contrary to the established rules of propriety his real object being to

keep his sovereign out of danger in this way the two parties separated

they of chi filled with shame at being foiled and disgraced by the man of

ceremonies and the result was that the lands of lu which had been

appropriated by chi were restored 

for two years more confucius held the office of minister of crime some

have supposed that he was further raised to the dignity of chief minister

of the state  but that was not the case one instance of the manner in

which he executed his functions is worth recording when any matter came

before him he took the opinion of different individuals upon it and in

giving judgment would say i decide according to the view of so and so

there was an approach to our jury system in the plan confuciuss object

being to enlist general sympathy and carry the public judgment with him

in his administration of justice a father having brought some charge

against his son confucius kept them both in prison for three months

without making any difference in favour of the father and then wished to

dismiss them both the head of the chi was dissatisfied and said you are

playing with me sir minister of crime formerly you told me that in a

state or a family filial duty was the first thing to be insisted on what

hinders you now from putting to death this unfilial son as an example to

all the people confucius with a sigh replied when superiors fail in their

duty and yet go to put their inferiors to death it is not right this father

has not taught his son to be filial to listen to his charge would be to slay

the guiltless the manners of the age have been long in a sad condition we

cannot expect the people not to be transgressing the laws 

at this time two of his disciples tszelu and tszeyu entered the

employment of the chi family and lent their influence the former

especially to forward the plans of their master one great cause of disorder

in the state was the fortified cities held by the three chiefs in which they

could defy the supreme authority and were in turn defied themselves by

their officers those cities were like the castles of the barons of england in

the time of the norman



 this meeting at chiaku is related in szema chien the narratives of

the school and kuliang with many exaggerations i have followed 



 the  says bk ii   but he was a  only in the sense

of an assistant of ceremonies as at the meeting in chiaku described

above

 see the  bk ii
kings confucius had their destruction very much at heart and partly by

the influence of persuasion and partly by the assisting counsels of tszelu

he accomplished his object in regard to pi  the chief city of the chi and

hau  the chief city of the shu

it does not appear that he succeeded in the same way in dismantling

chang  the chief city of the mang  but his authority in the state

greatly increased he strengthened the ducal house and weakened the

private families he exalted the sovereign and depressed the ministers a

transforming government went abroad dishonesty and dissoluteness were

ashamed and hid their heads loyalty and good faith became the

characteristics of the men and chastity and docility those of the women

strangers came in crowds from other states  confucius became the idol

of the people and flew in songs through their mouths 

but this sky of bright promise was soon overcast as the fame of the

reformations in lu went abroad the neighboring princes began to be

afraid the duke of chi said with confucius at the head of its government

lu will become supreme among the states and chi which is nearest to it

will be the first swallowed up let us propitiate it by a surrender of

territory one of his ministers proposed that they should first try to

separate between the sage and his sovereign and to effect this they hit

upon the following scheme eighty beautiful girls with musical and dancing

accomplishments and a hundred and twenty of the finest horses that could

be found were selected and sent as a present to duke ting they were put

up at first outside the city and chi hwan having gone in disguise to see

them forgot the lessons of confucius and took the duke to look at the bait

they were both captivated the women were received and the sage was

neglected for three days the duke gave no audience to his ministers

master said tszelu to confucius it is time for you to be going but

confucius was very unwilling to leave the spring was coming on when the

sacrifice to heaven would be offered and he determined to wait and see

whether the



 

 

 

 in connexion with these events the narratives of the school and szema

chien mention the summary punishment inflicted by confucius on an able

but unscrupulous and insidious officer the shaou chang maou  his

judgment and death occupy a conspicuous place in the legendary accounts

but the analects tszesze mencius and tso chiuming are all silent about

it and chiang yung rightly rejects it as one of the many narratives

invented to exalt the sage

 see the  bk ii

 see  quoted by chiang yung
solemnization of that would bring the duke back to his right mind no

such result followed the ceremony was hurried through and portions of

the offerings were not sent round to the various ministers according to the

established custom confucius regretfully took his departure going away

slowly and by easy stages  he would have welcomed a message of

recall but the duke continued in his abandonment and the sage went forth

to thirteen weary years of homeless wandering

 on leaving lu confucius first bent his steps westward to the state of

wei situate about where the present provinces of chihli and honan

adjoin



sidebar he wanders from state to state bc 



he was now in his fiftysixth year and felt depressed and melancholy

as he went along he gave expression to his feelings in verse



fain would i still look towards lu

but this kwei hill cuts off my view

with an axe id hew the thickets through

vain thought gainst the hill i nought can do
and again
through the valley howls the blast

drizzling rain falls thick and fast

homeward goes the youthful bride

oer the wild crowds by her side

how is it o azure heaven

from my home i thus am driven

through the land my way to trace

with no certain dwellingplace

dark dark the minds of men

worth in vain comes to their ken

hastens on my term of years

old age desolate appears 
a number of his disciples accompanied him and his sadness infected

them when they arrived at the borders of wei at a place called i the

warden sought an interview and on coming out from the sage he tried to

comfort the disciples saying my friends why are you distressed at your

masters loss of office the world has been long without the principles of

truth and right heaven is going to use your master as a bell with its

wooden tongue  such was the thought of this friendly stranger the bell

did indeed sound but few had ears to hear

confuciuss fame however had gone before him and he was in little

danger of having to suffer from want on arriving at the capital of wei he

lodged at first with a worthy officer named yen chauyu  the reigning

duke known to us by the epithet of ling  was a worthless dissipated

man but he could not neglect a visitor of such eminence and soon assigned

to confucius a revenue of  measures of grain  here he remained

for ten months and then for some reason left it to go to chan  on the

way he had to pass by kwang  a place probably in the present

department of kaifung in honan which had formerly suffered from

yanghu it so happened that confucius resembled hu and the attention of

the people being called to him by the movements of his carriagedriver

they thought it was their old enemy and made an attack upon him his

followers were alarmed but he was calm and tried to assure them by

declaring his belief that he had a divine mission he said to them after

the death of king wan was not the cause of truth lodged here in me if

heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish then i a future mortal

should not have got such a relation to that cause while heaven does not

let the cause of truth perish what can the people of kwang do to me 

having escaped from the hands of his assailants he does not seem to have

carried out his purpose of going to chan but returned to wei

on the way he passed a house where he had formerly lodged and

finding that the master was dead and the funeral ceremonies going on he

went in to condole and weep when he came out he told tszekung to take

the outside horses from his carriage and give them as a contribution to the

expenses of the occasion you never did such a thing tszekung

remonstrated at the funeral of any of your disciples is it not too great a

gift on this occasion of the death of an old host when i went in replied

confucius my presence brought a burst of grief from the chief mourner

and i joined him with my tears i dislike the thought of my tears not being

followed by anything do it my child  on reaching wei he lodged with

chu poyu an officer of whom

honourable mention is made in the analects  but this time he did not

remain long in the state the duke was



sidebar bc 



married to a lady of the house of sung known by the name of nantsze

notorious for her intrigues and wickedness she sought an interview with

the sage which he was obliged unwillingly to accord  no doubt he was

innocent of thought or act of evil but it gave great dissatisfaction to tsze

lu that his master should have been in company with such a woman and

confucius to assure him swore an oath saying wherein i have done

improperly may heaven reject me may heaven reject me  he could

not well abide however about such a court one day the duke rode out

through the streets of his capital in the same carriage with nantsze and

made confucius follow them in another perhaps he intended to honour the

philosopher but the people saw the incongruity and cried out lust in the

front virtue behind confucius was ashamed and made the observation i

have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty  wei was no

place for him he left it and took his way towards chan

chan which formed part of the present province of honan lay south

from wei after passing the small state of tsao  he approached the

borders of sung occupying the present prefecture of kweiteh and had

some intentions of entering it when an incident occurred which it is not

easy to understand from the meagre style in which it is related but which

gave occasion to a remarkable saying confucius was practising ceremonies

with his disciples we are told under the shade of a large tree hwan tui

an illminded officer of sung heard of it and sent a band of men to pull

down the tree and kill the philosopher if they could get hold of him the

disciples were much alarmed but confucius observed heaven has

produced the virtue that is in me what can hwan tui do to me  they

all made their escape but seem to have been driven westwards to the

state of chang  on arriving at the gate conducting into which from the

east confucius found himself separated from his followers tszekung had

arrived before him and was told by a native of chang that there was a

man standing by the east gate with a forehead like yao a neck like kao

yao his shoulders on a level with those of tszechan but wanting below

the waist three

inches of the height of yu and altogether having the disconsolate

appearance of a stray dog tszekung knew it was the master hastened to

him and repeated to his great amusement the description which the man

had given the bodily appearance said confucius is but a small matter

but to say i was like a stray dog capital capital the stay they made at

chang was short and by the end of bc  confucius was in chan

all the next year he remained there lodging with the warder of the city

wall an officer of worth of the name of chang  and we have no

accounts of him which deserve to be related here 

in bc  chan was much disturbed by attacks from wu  a large

state the capital of which was in the present department of suchau and

confucius determined to retrace his steps to wei on the way he was laid

hold of at a place called pu  which was held by a rebellious officer

against wei and before he could get away he was obliged to engage that

he would not proceed thither thither notwithstanding he continued his

route and when tszekung asked him whether it was right to violate the

oath he had taken he replied it was a forced oath the spirits do not hear

such  the duke ling received him with distinction but paid no more

attention to his lessons than before and confucius is said then to have

uttered his complaint if there were any of the princes who would employ

me in the course of twelve months i should have done something

considerable in three years the government would be perfected 

a circumstance occurred to direct his attention to the state of tsin 

which occupied the southern part of the present shanhsi and extended

over the yellow river into honan an invitation came to confucius like

that which he had formerly received from kungshan fuzao pi hsi an

officer of tsin who was holding the town of chungmau against his chief

invited him to visit him and confucius was inclined to go tszelu was

always the mentor on such occasions he said to him master i have heard

you say



 see the   p 

  see mencius v pt i viii 

 chiang yung digests in this place two foolish stories about a large bone

found in the state of yueh and a bird which appeared in chia and died

shot through with a remarkable arrow confucius knew all about them

 

 

 this ia related by szema chien  p  and also in the narratives

of the school i would fain believe it is not true the wonder is that no

chinese critic should have set about disproving it

 ana xii x

 
that when a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil a superior

man will not associate with him pi hsi is in rebellion if you go to him

what shall be said confucius replied yes i did use those words but is it

not said that if a thing be really hard it may be ground without being

made thin and if it be really white it may be steeped in a dark fluid

without being made black am i a bitter gourd am i to be hung up out of

the way of being eaten 

these sentiments sound strangely from his lips after all he did not go

to pi hsi and having travelled as far as the yellow river that he might see

one of the principal ministers of tsin he heard of the violent death of two

men of worth and returned to wei lamenting the fate which prevented

him from crossing the stream and trying to solace himself with poetry as

he had done on leaving lu again did he communicate with the duke but

as ineffectually and disgusted at being questioned by him about military

tactics he left and went back to chan

he resided in chan all the next year bc  without anything

occurring there which is worthy of note  events had transpired in lu

however which were to issue in his return to his native state the duke

ting had deceased bc  and chi hwan the chief of the chi family died

in this year on his deathbed he felt remorse for his conduct to confucius

and charged his successor known to us in the analects as chi kang to

recall the sage but the charge was not immediately fulfilled chi kang by

the advice of one of his officers sent to chan for the disciple yen chiu

instead confucius willingly sent him off and would gladly have

accompanied him let me return he said let me return  but that was

not to be for several years yet

in bc  accompanied as usual by several of his disciples he went

from chan to tsai a small dependency of the great fief of chu which

occupied a large part of the present provinces of hunan and hupei on

the way between chan and tsai their provisions became exhausted and

they were cut off somehow from obtaining a fresh supply the disciples

were quite overcome with want and tszelu said to the master has the

superior man indeed to endure in this way confucius answered him the

superior man may indeed have to endure want but the mean man



l ana xvii vii

 tso chiuming indeed relates a story of confucius on the report of a

fire in lu telling whose ancestral temple had been destroyed by it

 ana v xxi
when he is in want gives way to unbridled license  according to the

narratives of the school the distress continued seven days during which

time confucius retained his equanimity and was even cheerful playing on

his lute and singing  he retained however a strong impression of the

perils of the season and we find him afterwards recurring to it and

lamenting that of the friends that were with him in chan and tsai there

were none remaining to enter his door 

escaped from this strait he remained in tsai over bc  and in the

following year we find him in sheh another district of chu the chief of

which had taken the title of duke according to the usurping policy of that

state puzzled about his visitor he asked tszelu what he should think of

him but the disciple did not venture a reply when confucius heard of it

he said to tszelu why did you not say to him he is simply a man who

in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his food who in the joy of its

attainment forgets his sorrows and who does not perceive that old age is

coming on  subsequently the duke in conversation with confucius

asked him about government and got the reply dictated by some

circumstances of which we are ignorant good government obtains when

those who are near are made happy and those who are far off are

attracted 

after a short stay in sheh according to szema chien he returned to

tsai and having to dross a river he sent tszelu to inquire for the ford of

two men who were at work in a neighboring field they were recluses

men who had withdrawn from public life in disgust at the waywardness of

the times one of them was called changtsu and instead of giving tszelu

the information he wanted he asked him who is it that holds the reins in

the carriage there it is kung chiu kung chiu of lu yes was the

reply and then the man rejoined he knows the ford

tszelu applied to the other who was called chiehni but got for

answer the question who are you sir he replied i am chung yu

chung yu who is the disciple of kung chiu of lu yes again replied

tszelu and chiehni said to him disorder like a swelling flood spreads

over the whole kingdom

and who is he that will change it for you than follow one who merely

withdraws from this one and that one had you not better follow those who

withdraw from the world altogether with this he fell to covering up the

seed and gave no more heed to the stranger tszelu went back and

reported what they had said when confucius vindicated his own course

saying it is impossible to associate with birds and beasts as if they were

the same with us if i associate not with these people with mankind

with whom shall i associate if right principles prevailed through the

kingdom there would be no need for me to change its state 

about the same time he had an encounter with another recluse who

was known as the madman of chu he passed by the carriage of

confucius singing out o phoenix o phoenix how is your virtue

degenerated as to the past reproof is useless but the future may be

provided against give up give up your vain pursuit confucius alighted

and wished to enter into conversation with him but the man hastened

away 

but now the attention of the ruler of chu  king as he styled himself 

was directed to the illustrious stranger who was in his dominions and he

met confucius and conducted him to his capital which was in the present

district of ichang in the department of hsiangyang  in hupei after a

time he proposed endowing the philosopher with a considerable territory

but was dissuaded by his prime minister who said to him has your

majesty any officer who could discharge the duties of an ambassador like

tszekung or any one so qualified for a premier as yen hui or any one to

compare as a general with tszelu the kings wan and wu from their

hereditary dominions of a hundred li rose to the sovereignty of the

kingdom if kung chiu with such disciples to be his ministers get the

possession of any territory it will not be to the prosperity of chu  on

this remonstrance the king gave up his purpose and when he died in the

same year confucius left the state and went back again to wei

the duke ling had died four years before soon after confucius

had last parted from him and the reigning duke known to us by the

title of chu  was his grandson and was holding the principality against

his own father the relations

between them were rather complicated the father had been driven out

in consequence of an attempt which he had instigated on the life of his

stepmother the notorious nantsze and the succession was given to his

son subsequently the father wanted to reclaim what he deemed his right

and an unseemly struggle ensued the duke chu was conscious how much

his cause would be strengthened by the support of confucius and hence

when he got to wei tszelu could say to him the prince of wei has been

waiting for you in order with you to administer the government what

will you consider the first thing to be done  the opinion of the

philosopher however was against the propriety of the dukes course 

and he declined taking office with him though he remained in wei for

between five and six years during all that time there is a blank in his

history in the very year of his return according to the annals of the

empire his most beloved disciple yen hui died on which occasion he

exclaimed alas heaven is destroying me heaven is destroying me 

the death of his wife is assigned to bc  but nothing else is related

which we can connect with this long period

 his return to lu was brought about by the disciple yen yu who we

have seen went into the service of chi kang in bc 



sidebar from his return to lu to his death bc 



in the year bc  yu had the conduct of some military operations

against chi and being successful chi kang asked him how he had

obtained his military skill was it from nature or by learning he replied

that he had learned it from confucius and entered into a glowing eulogy of

the philosopher the chief declared that he would bring confucius home

again to lu if you do so said the disciple see that you do not let mean

men come between you and him on this kang sent three officers with

appropriate presents to wei to invite the wanderer home and he returned

with them accordingly 

this event took place in the eleventh year of the duke ai  who

succeeded to ting and according to kung fu confuciuss descendant the

invitation proceeded from him  we may suppose that



 ana xiii iii in the notes on this passage i have given chu hsis

opinion as to the time when tszelu made this remark it seems more

correct however to refer it to confuciuss return to wei from chu as is

done by chiang yung

chronological difficulty connected with the dates assigned respectively to

the deaths of yen hui and confuciuss own son li chiang yung assigns

 see chiang yungs memoir in loc
while chi kang was the mover and director of the proceeding it was

with the authority and approval of the duke it is represented in the

chronicle of tso chiuming as having occurred at a very opportune time

the philosopher had been consulted a little before by kung wan  an

officer of wei about how he should conduct a feud with another officer

and disgusted at being referred to on such a subject had ordered his

carriage and prepared to leave the state exclaiming the bird chooses its

tree the tree does not choose the bird kung wan endeavoured to excuse

himself and to prevail on confucius to remain in wei and just at this

juncture the messengers from lu arrived 

confucius was now in his sixtyninth year the world had not dealt

kindly with him in every state which he had visited he had met with

disappointment and sorrow only five more years remained to him nor

were they of a brighter character than the past he had indeed attained to

that state he tells us in which he could follow what his heart desired

without transgressing what was right  but other people were not more

inclined than they had been to abide by his counsels the duke ai and chi

kang often conversed with him but he no longer had weight in the

guidance of state affairs and wisely addressed himself to the completion of

his literary labors he wrote a preface according to szema chien to the

shuching carefully digested the rites and ceremonies determined by the

wisdom of the more ancient sages and kings collected and arranged the

ancient poetry and undertook the reform of music  he has told us

himself i returned from wei to lu and then the music was reformed and

the pieces in the songs of the kingdom and praise songs found all their

proper place  to the yiching he devoted much study and szema

chien says that the leather thongs by which the tablets of his copy were

bound together were thrice worn out if some years were added to my

life he said i would give fifty to the study of the yi and then i might

come to be without great faults  during this time also we may suppose

that he supplied tsang shan with the materials of the classic of filial piety

the same year that he returned chi kang sent yen yu to ask his opinion

about an

 ana vii xvi
additional impost which he wished to lay upon the people but confucius

refused to give any reply telling the disciple privately his disapproval of

the proposed measure it was carried out however in the following year

by the agency of yen on which occasion i suppose it was that confucius

said to the other disciples he is no disciple of mine my little children

beat the drum and assail him  the year bc  was marked by the

death of his son li which he seems to have borne with more equanimity

than he did that of his disciple yen hui which some writers assign to the

following year though i have already mentioned it under the year bc



in the spring of bc  a servant of chi kang caught a chilin on a

hunting excursion of the duke in the present district of chiahsiang  no

person could tell what strange animal it was and confucius was called to

look at it he at once knew it to be a lin and the legendwriters say

that it bore on one of its horns the piece of ribbon which his mother had

attached to the one that appeared to her before his birth according to the

chronicle of kungyang he was profoundly affected he cried out for

whom have you come for whom have you come his tears flowed freely

and he added the course of my doctrines is run 

notwithstanding the appearance of the lin the life of confucius

was still protracted for two years longer though he took occasion to

terminate with that event his history of the chun chiu this work

according to szema chien was altogether the production of this year but

we heed not suppose that it was so in it from the standpoint of lu he

briefly indicates the principal events occurring throughout the country

every term being expressive it is said of the true character of the actors

and events described confucius said himself it is the spring and autumn

which will make men know me and it is the spring and autumn which

will make men condemn me  mencius makes the composition of it to

have been an achievement as great as yus regulation of the waters of the

deluge confucius completed the spring and autumn and rebellious

ministers and villainous sons were struck with terror 

towards the end of this year word came to lu that the duke

   according to kungyang however the lin was

found by some woodgatherers

 mencius iii pt ii ix 

 mencius iii pt ii ix 
of chi had been murdered by one of his officers confucius was moved

with indignation such an outrage he felt called for his solemn

interference he bathed went to court and represented the matter to the

duke saying chan hang has slain his sovereign i beg that you will

undertake to punish him the duke pleaded his incapacity urging that lu

was weak compared with chi but confucius replied one half the people

of chi are not consenting to the deed if you add to the people of lu one

half the people of chi you are sure to overcome but he could not infuse

his spirit into the duke who told him to go and lay the matter before the

chiefs of the three families sorely against his sense of propriety he did so

but they would not act and he withdrew with the remark following in

the rear of the great officers i did not dare not to represent such a matter



in the year bc  confucius had to mourn the death of another of his

disciples one of those who had been longest with him the wellknown

tszelu he stands out a sort of peter in the confucian school a man of

impulse prompt to speak and prompt to act he gets many a check from

the master but there is evidently a strong sympathy between them tsze

lu uses a freedom with him on which none of the other disciples dares to

venture and there is not one among them all for whom if i may speak

from my own feeling the foreign student comes to form such a liking a

pleasant picture is presented to us in one passage of the analects it is

said the disciple min was standing by his side looking bland and precise

tszelu named yu looking bold and soldierly yen yu and tszekung

with a free and straightforward manner the master was pleased but he

observed yu there he will not die a natural death 

this prediction was verified when confucius returned to lu from wei

he left tszelu and tszekao  engaged there in official service troubles

arose news came to lu bc  that a revolution was in progress in wei

and when confucius heard it he said chai will come here but yu will die

 so it turned out when tszekao saw that matters were desperate he

made his escape but tszelu would not forsake the chief who had treated

 see the  
him well he threw himself into the melee and was slain confucius

wept sore for him but his own death was not far off it took place on the

eleventh day of the fourth month in the same year bc   early one

morning we are told he got up and with his hands behind his back

dragging his staff he moved about by his door crooning over



the great mountain must crumble

the strong beam must break

and the wise man wither away like a plant
after a little he entered the house and sat down opposite the door

tszekung had heard his words and said to himself if the great mountain

crumble to what shall i look up if the strong beam break and the wise

man wither away on whom shall i lean the master i fear is going to be

ill with this he hastened into the house confucius said to him tsze what

makes you so late according to the statutes of hsia the corpse was

dressed and coffined at the top of the eastern steps treating the dead as if

he were still the host under the yin the ceremony was performed

between the two pillars as if the dead were both host and guest the rule

of chau is to perform it at the top of the western steps treating the dead

as if he were a guest i am a man of yin and last night i dreamt that i was

sitting with offerings before me between the two pillars no intelligent

monarch arises there is not one in the kingdom that will make me his

master my time has come to die so it was he went to his couch and after

seven days expired 

such is the account which we have of the last hours of the great

philosopher of china his end was not unimpressive but it was melancholy

he sank behind a cloud disappointed hopes made his soul bitter the great

ones of the kingdom had not received his teachings no wife nor child was

by to do the kindly offices of affection for him nor were the expectations

of another life present with him as he passed through the dark valley he

uttered no prayer and he betrayed no apprehensions deeptreasured in

his own heart may have been the thought that he had endeavoured to

serve his generation by the will of god but he gave no sign the mountain

falling came to nought and the rock was removed

out of his place so death prevailed against him and he passed his

countenance was changed and he was sent away

 i flatter myself that the preceding paragraphs contain a more

correct narrative of the principal incidents in the life of confucius than has

yet been given in any european language they might easily have been

expanded into a volume but i did not wish to exhaust the subject but only

to furnish a sketch which while it might satisfy the general reader would

be of special assistance to the careful student of the classical books i had

taken many notes of the manifest errors in regard to chronology and other

matters in the narratives of the school and the chapter of szema chien

on the kung family when the digest of chiang yung to which i have made

frequent reference attracted my attention conclusions to which i had

come were confirmed and a clue was furnished to difficulties which i was

seeking to disentangle i take the opportunity to acknowledge here my

obligations to it with a few notices of confuciuss habits and manners i

shall conclude this section

very little can be gathered from reliable sources on the personal

appearance of the sage the height of his father is stated as i have noted

to have been ten feet and though confucius came short of this by four

inches he was often called the tall man it is allowed that the ancient foot

or cubit was shorter than the modem but it must be reduced more than

any scholar i have consulted has yet done to bring this statement within

the range of credibility the legends assign to his figure nineandforty

remarkable peculiarities  a tenth part of which would have made him

more a monster than a man dr morrison says that the images of him

which he had seen in the northern parts of china represent him as of a

dark swarthy colour  it is not so with those common in the south he

was no doubt in size and complexion much the same as many of his

descendants in the present day dr edkins and myself enjoyed the services

of two of those descendants who acted as wheelers in the wheelbarrows

which conveyed us from chufau to a town on the grand canal more than

 miles off they were strong capable men both physically and

mentally superior to their companions



 

 chinese and english dictionary char  sir john davis also mentions

seeing a figure of confucius in a temple near the poyang lake of which

the complexion was quite black the chinese vol ii p 
but if his disciples had nothing to chronicle of his personal appearance

they have gone very minutely into an account of many of his habits the

tenth book of the analects is all occupied with his deportment his eating

and his dress in public whether in the village the temple or the court he

was the man of rule and ceremony but at home he was not formal yet if

not formal he was particular in bed even he did not forget himself he

did not lie like a corpse and he did not speak he required his sleeping

dress to be half as long again as his body if he happened to be sick and

the prince came to visit him he had his face set to the east made his court

robes be put over him and drew his girdle across them

he was nice in his diet not disliking to have his rice dressed fine nor

to have his minced meat cut small anything at all gone he would not

touch he must have his meat cut properly and to every kind its proper

sauce but he was not a great eater it was only in drink that he laid down

no limit to himself but he did not allow himself to be confused by it

when the villagers were drinking together on those who carried staffs

going out he went out immediately after there must always be ginger at

the table and when eating he did not converse although his food might

be coarse rice and poor soup he would offer a little of it in sacrifice with a

grave respectful air

on occasion of a sudden clap of thunder or a violent wind he would

change countenance he would do the same and rise up moreover when

he found himself a guest at a loaded board at the sight of a person in

mourning he would also change countenance and if he happened to be in

his carriage he would bend forward with a respectful salutation his

general way in his carriage was not to turn his head round nor talk

hastily nor point with his hands he was charitable when any of his

friends died if there were no relations who could be depended on for the

necessary offices he would say i will bury him

the disciples were so careful to record these and other characteristics

of their master it is said because every act of movement or of rest was

closely associated with the great principles which it was his object to

inculcate the detail of so many small matters however hardly impresses

a foreigner so favourably there rather seems to be a want of freedom

about the philosopher

his influence and opinions
 confucius died we have seen complaining that of all the princes of

principles and obey his lessons he had hardly passed from the stage of

life when his merit began to be acknowledged when the duke ai heard of

his death he pronounced his eulogy in the words heaven has not left to

me the aged man there is none now to assist me on the throne woe is me

alas o venerable ni  tszekung complained of the inconsistency of this

lamentation from one who could not use the master when he was alive but

the prince was probably sincere in his grief he caused a temple to be

erected and ordered that sacrifice should be offered to the sage at the

four seasons of the year 

the sovereigns of the tottering dynasty of chau had not the intelligence

nor were they in a position to do honour to the departed philosopher but

the facts detailed in the first chapter of these prolegomena in connexion

with the attempt of the founder of the chin dynasty to destroy the literary

monuments of antiquity show how the authority of confucius had come by

that time to prevail through the nation the founder of the han dynasty in

passing through lu bc  visited his tomb and offered the three victims

in sacrifice to him other sovereigns since then have often made

pilgrimages to the spot the most famous temple in the empire now rises

near the place of the grave the second and greatest of the rulers of the

present dynasty in the twentythird year of his reign the kanghsi

period there set the example of kneeling thrice and each time laying his

forehead thrice in the dust before the image of the sage

in the year of our lord  began the practice of conferring honourary

designations on confucius by imperial authority the emperor ping  then

styled him the duke ni allcomplete and

illustrious  this was changed in ad  to the venerable ni the

accomplished sage  other titles have supplanted this shunchih  the

first of the manchau dynasty adopted in his second year ad  the

style kung the ancient teacher accomplished and illustrious all

complete the perfect sage  but twelve years later a shorter title was

introduced kung the ancient teacher the perfect sage  since that

year no further alteration has been made

at first the worship of confucius was confined to the country of lu but

in ad  it was enacted that sacrifices should be offered to him in the

imperial college and in all the colleges of the principal territorial divisions

throughout the empire in those sacrifices he was for some centuries

associated with the duke of chau the legislator to whom confucius made

frequent reference but in ad  separate temples were assigned to

them and in  our sage displaced the older worthy altogether about

the same time began the custom which continues to the present day of

erecting temples to him separate structures in connexion with all the

colleges or examinationhalls of the country

the sage is not alone in those temples in a hall behind the principal one

occupied by himself are the tablets  in some cases the images  of

several of his ancestors and other worthies while associated with himself

are his principal disciples and many who in subsequent times have

signalized themselves as expounders and exemplifiers of his doctrines on

the first day of every month offerings of fruits and vegetables are set

forth and on the fifteenth there is a solemn burning of incense but twice a

year in the middle months of spring and autumn when the first ting

day  of the month comes round the worship of confucius is performed

with peculiar solemnity at the imperial college the emperor himself is

required to attend in state and is in fact the principal performer after all

the preliminary arrangements have been made and the emperor has twice

knelt and six times bowed his head to the earth the presence of

confuciuss spirit is invoked in the words great art thou o perfect sage

thy virtue is full thy doctrine is complete among mortal men there has

not been thine equal all kings honour thee thy statutes and laws have

come gloriously



 

 

 

   

 

 
down thou art the pattern in this imperial school reverently have the

sacrificial vessels been set out full of awe we sound our drums and bells



the spirit is supposed now to be present and the service proceeds

through various offerings when the first of which has been set forth an

officer reads the following  which is the prayer on the occasion on

this  month of this  year i ab the emperor offer a sacrifice to

the philosopher kung the ancient teacher the perfect sage and say o

teacher in virtue equal to heaven and earth whose doctrines embrace the

past time and the present thou didst digest and transmit the six classics

and didst hand down lessons for all generations now in this second month

of spring or autumn in reverent observance of the old statutes with

victims silks spirits and fruits i carefully offer sacrifice to thee with

thee are associated the philosopher yen continuator of thee the

philosopher tsang exhibiter of thy fundamental principles the

philosopher tszesze transmitter of thee and the philosopher mang

second to thee mayst thou enjoy the offerings

i need not go on to enlarge on the homage which the emperors of china

render to confucius it could not be more complete he was unreasonably

neglected when alive he is now unreasonably venerated when dead

 the rulers of china are not singular in this matter but in entire

sympathy with the mass of their people it is the distinction



sidebar general appreciation of confucius



of this empire that education has been highly prized in it from the

earliest times it was so before the era of confucius and we may be sure

that the system met with his approbation one of his remarkable sayings

was to lead an uninstructed people to war is to throw them away 

when he pronounced this judgment he was not thinking of military

training but of education in the duties of life and citizenship a people so

taught he thought would be morally fitted to fight for their government

mencius when lecturing to the ruler of tang on the proper way of

governing a kingdom told him that he must provide the means of

education for all the poor as well as the rich establish said he hsiang

hsu hsio and hsiao all those educational institutions for the

instruction of the people 



  see the 

 ana xiii xxx

 mencius iii pt i iii 
at the present day education is widely diffused throughout china in

few other countries is the schoolmaster more abroad and in all schools it is

confucius who is taught the plan of competitive examinations and the

selection for civil offices only from those who have been successful

candidates good so far as the competition is concerned but injurious

from the restricted range of subjects with which an acquaintance is

required have obtained for more than twelve centuries the classical

works are the text books it is from them almost exclusively that the

themes proposed to determine the knowledge and ability of the students

are chosen the whole of the magistracy of china is thus versed in all that

is recorded of the sage and in the ancient literature which he preserved

his thoughts are familiar to every man in authority and his character is

more or less reproduced in him

the official civilians of china numerous as they are are but a fraction

of its students and the students or those who make literature a

profession are again but a fraction of those who attend school for a shorter

or longer period yet so far as the studies have gone they have been

occupied with the confucian writings in the schoolrooms there is a tablet

or inscription on the wall sacred to the sage and every pupil is required

on coming to school on the morning of the first and fifteenth of every

month to bow before it the first thing as an act of reverence  thus all

in china who receive the slightest tincture of learning do so at the fountain

of confucius they learn of him and do homage to him at once i have

repeatedly quoted the statement that during his lifetime he had three

thousand disciples hundreds of millions are his disciples now it is hardly

necessary to make any allowance in this statement for the followers of

taoism and buddhism for as sir john davis has observed whatever the

other opinions or faith of a chinese may be he takes good care to treat

confucius with respect  for two thousand years he has reigned

supreme the undisputed teacher of this most populous land

 this position and influence of confucius are to be ascribed i conceive

chiefly to two causes his being the preserver namely of



l during the present dynasty the tablet of  the god of literature

has to a considerable extent displaced that of confucius in schools yet the

worship of him does not clash with that of the other he is the father of

composition only

 the chinese vol ii p 
the monuments of antiquity and the exemplifier and expounder of



sidebar the causes of his influence



the maxims of the golden age of china and the devotion to him of his

immediate disciples and their early followers the national and the

personal are thus blended in him each in its highest degree of excellence

he was a chinese of the chinese he is also represented as and all now

believe him to have been the beau ideal of humanity in its best and

noblest estate

 it may be well to bring forward here confuciuss own estimate of

himself and of his doctrines it will serve to illustrate the



sidebar his own estimate of himself and of his doctrines



statements just made the following are some of his sayings the sage

and the man of perfect virtue how dare i rank myself with them it

may simply be said of me that i strive to become such without satiety

and teach others without weariness in letters i am perhaps equal to

other men but the character of the superior man carrying out in his

conduct what he professes is what i have not yet attained to the leaving

virtue without proper cultivation the not thoroughly discussing what is

learned not being able to move towards righteousness of which a

knowledge is gained and not being able to change what is not good

these are the things which occasion me solicitude i am not one who was

born in the possession of knowledge i am one who is fond of antiquity and

earnest in seeking it there a transmitter and not a maker believing in

and loving the ancients i venture to compare myself with our old pang



confucius cannot be thought to speak of himself in these declarations

more highly than he ought to do rather we may recognise in them the

expressions of a genuine humility he was conscious that personally he

came short in many things but he toiled after the character which he saw

or fancied that he saw in the ancient sages whom he acknowledged and

the lessons of government and morals which he labored to diffuse were

those which had already been inculcated and exhibited by them

emphatically he was a transmitter and not a maker it is not to be

understood that he was not fully satisfied of the truth of the principles

which he had learned he held them with the full approval and consent of

his own understanding he believed that if they were acted on they would

remedy the evils of his time



 all these passages are taken from the seventh book of the analects

see chapters xxxiii xxxii iii xix and i
there was nothing to prevent rulers like yao and shun and the great yu

from again arising and a condition of happy tranquillity being realized

throughout the kingdom under their sway

if in anything he thought himself superior and alone having attributes

which others could not claim it was in his possessing a divine commission

as the conservator of ancient truth and rules he does not speak very

definitely on this point it is noted that the appointments of heaven was

one of the subjects on which he rarely touched  his most remarkable

utterance was that which i have already given in the sketch of his life

when he was put in fear in kwang he said after the death of king wan

was not the cause of truth lodged here in me if heaven had wished to let

this cause of truth perish then i a future mortal should not have got such

a relation to that cause while heaven does not let the cause of truth

perish what can the people of kwang do to me  confucius then did

feel that he was in the world for a special purpose but it was not to

announce any new truths or to initiate any new economy it was to

prevent what had previously been known from being lost he followed in

the wake of yao and shun of tang and king wan distant from the last by

a long interval of time he would have said that he was distant from him

also by a great inferiority of character but still he had learned the

principles on which they all happily governed the country and in their

name he would lift up a standard against the prevailing lawlessness of his

age

 the language employed with reference to confucius by his disciples

and their early followers presents a striking contrast with his own



sidebar estimate of him by his disciples and their early

followers



i have already in writing of the scope and value of the doctrine of the

mean called attention to the extravagant eulogies of his grandson tsze

sze he only followed the example which had been set by those among

whom the philosopher went in and out we have the language of yen yuan

his favourite which is comparatively moderate and simply expresses the

genuine admiration of a devoted pupil  tszekung on several occasions

spoke in a different style having heard that one of the chiefs of lu had

said that he himself  tszekung  was superior to confucius he

observed let me use the comparison of a house and its encompassing

wall my wall

only reaches to the shoulders one may peep over it and see whatever

is valuable in the apartments the wall of my master is several fathoms

high if one do not find the door and enter by it he cannot see the rich

ancestral temple with its beauties nor all the officers in their rich array

but i may assume that they are few who find the door the remark of the

chief was only what might have been expected 

another time the same individual having spoken revilingly of

confucius tszekung said it is of no use doing so chungni cannot be

reviled the talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and mounds

which may be stepped over chungni is the sun or moon which it is not

possible to step over although a man may wish to cut himself off from the

sage what harm can he do to the sun and moon he only shows that he

does not know his own capacity 

in conversation with a fellowdisciple tszekung took a still higher

flight being charged by tszechin with being too modest for that

confucius was not really superior to him he replied for one word a man

is often deemed to be wise and for one word he is often deemed to be

foolish we ought to be careful indeed in what we say our master cannot

be attained to just in the same way as the heavens cannot be gone up to

by the steps of a stair were our master in the position of the prince of a

state or the chief of a family we should find verified the description

which has been given of a sages rule he would plant the people and

forthwith they would be established he would lead them on and forthwith

they would follow him he would make them happy and forthwith

multitudes would resort to his dominions he would stimulate them and

forthwith they would be harmonious while he lived he would be glorious

when he died he would be bitterly lamented how is it possible for him to

be attained to 

from these representations of tszekung it was not a difficult step for

tszesze to take in exalting confucius not only to the level of the ancient

sages but as the equal of heaven and mencius took up the theme being

questioned by kungsun chau one of his disciples about two

acknowledged sages poi and i yin whether they were to be placed in the

same rank with confucius he replied no since there were living men

until now there never was another confucius and then he proceeded to

fortify his



 ana xix xxiii

 ana xix xxiv

 ana xix xxv
opinion by the concurring testimony of tsai wo tszekung and yu zo

who all had wisdom he thought sufficient to know their master tsai wos

opinion was according to my view of our master he is far superior to yao

and shun tszekung said by viewing the ceremonial ordinances of a

prince we know the character of his government by hearing his music we

know the character of his virtue from the distance of a hundred ages

after i can arrange according to their merits the kings of those hundred

ages not one of them can escape me from the birth of mankind till now

there has never been another like our master yu zo said is it only among

men that it is so there is the chilin among quadrupeds the funghwang

among birds the tai mountain among mounds and anthills and rivers

and seas among rainpools though different in degree they are the same in

kind so the sages among mankind are also the same in kind but they

stand out from their fellows and rise above the level and from the birth

of mankind till now there never has been one so complete as confucius

 i will not indulge in farther illustration the judgment of the sages

disciples of tszesze and of mencius has been unchallenged by the mass

of the scholars of china doubtless it pleases them to bow down at the

shrine of the sage for their profession of literature is thereby glorified a

reflection of the honour done to him falls upon themselves and the

powers that be and the multitudes of the people fall in with the judgment

confucius is thus in the empire of china the one man by whom all possible

personal excellence was exemplified and by whom all possible lessons of

social virtue and political wisdom are taught

 the reader will be prepared by the preceding account not to expect to

find any light thrown by confucius on the great problems of the human

condition and destiny he did not speculate on the creation of things or the

end of them he was not troubled to account for the origin of man nor did

he seek to know about his hereafter he meddled neither with physics nor

metaphysics 



sidebar subjects on which confucius did not treat that he

was unreligious unspiritual and open to the charge of insincerity



the testimony of the analects about the subjects of his teaching is the

following his frequent themes of discourse were the book



 mencius ii pt i ii 

 the contents of the yiching and confuciuss labors upon it may be

objected in opposition to this statement and i must be understood to make

it with come reservation six years ago i spent all my leisure time for

twelve months in the study of that work and wrote out a translation of it

but at the close i was only groping my way in darkness to lay hold of

footnote continued next page
of poetry the book of history and the maintenance of the rules of

propriety he taught letters ethics devotion of soul and truthfulness

extraordinary things feats of strength states of disorder and spiritual

beings he did not like to talk about 

confucius is not to be blamed for his silence on the subjects here

indicated his ignorance of them was to a great extent his misfortune he

had not learned them no report of them had come to him by the ear no

vision of them by the eye and to his practical mind the toiling of thought

amid uncertainties seemed worse than useless

the question has indeed been raised whether he did not make changes

in the ancient creed of china  but i cannot believe that he did so

consciously and designedly had his idiosyncrasy been different we might

have had expositions of the ancient views on some points the effect of

which would have been more beneficial than the indefiniteness in which

they are now left and it may be doubted so far whether confucius was not

unfaithful to his guides but that he suppressed or added in order to bring

in articles of belief originating with himself is a thing not to be charged

against him

i will mention two important subjects in regard to which there is a

conviction in my mind that he came short of the faith of the older sages

the first is the doctrine of god this name is common in the shihching and

shuching ti or shangti appears there as a personal being

ruling in heaven and on earth the author of mans moral nature the

governor among the nations by whom kings reign and princes decree

justice the rewarder of the good and the punisher of the bad confucius

preferred to speak of heaven instances have already been given of this

two others may be cited he who offends against heaven has none to

whom he can pray  alas  said he there is no one that knows me

tszekung said what do you mean by thus saying that no one knows

you he replied i do not murmur against heaven i do



footnote continued from previous page its scope and meaning and up

to this time i have not been able to master it so as to speak positively

about it it will come in due time in its place in the present publication

and i do not think that what i here say of confucius will require much if

any modification so i wrote in  and i at last accomplished a

translation of the yi which was published in  as the sixteenth volume

of the sacred books of the east i should like to bring out a revision of

that version with the chinese text so as to make it uniform with the

volumes of the classics previously published but as yang ho said to

confucius the years do not wait for us

reference in a note to a passage from meadowss the chinese and their

rebellions

 ana iii xiii
not grumble against men my studies lie low and my penetration rises

high but there is heaven that knows me  not once throughout the

analects does he use the personal name i would say that he was

unreligious rather than irreligious yet by the coldness of his temperament

and intellect in this matter his influence is unfavourable to the

development of ardent religious feeling among the chinese people

generally and he prepared the way for the speculations of the literati of

medieval and modern times which have exposed them to the charge of

atheism

secondly along with the worship of god there existed in china from

the earliest historical times the worship of other spiritual beings

especially and to every individual the worship of departed ancestors

confucius recognised this as an institution to be devoutly observed he

sacrificed to the dead as if they were present he sacrificed to the spirits as

if the spirits were present he said i consider my not being present at the

sacrifice as if i did not sacrifice  the custom must have originated

from a belief in the continued existence of the dead we cannot suppose

that they who instituted it thought that with the cessation of this life on

earth there was a cessation also of all conscious being but confucius never

spoke explicitly on this subject he tried to evade it chi lu asked about

serving the spirits of the dead and the master said while you are not

able to serve men how can you serve their spirits the disciple added i

venture to ask about death and he was answered while you do not

know life how can you know about death  still more striking is a

conversation with another disciple recorded in the narratives of the

school tszekung asked him saying do the dead have knowledge of our

services that is or are they without knowledge the master replied if i

were to say that the dead have such knowledge i am afraid that filial sons

and dutiful grandsons would injure their substance in paying the last

offices to the departed and if i were to say that the dead have not such

knowledge i am afraid lest unfilial sons should leave their parents

unburied you need not wish tsze to know whether the dead have

knowledge or not there is no present urgency about the point hereafter

you will know it for yourself  surely this was not the teaching proper

to a sage

   art  towards the end
he said on one occasion that he had no concealments from his disciples

 why did he not candidly tell his real thoughts on so interesting a

subject i incline to think that he doubted more than he believed if the

case were not so it would be difficult to account for the answer which he

returned to a question as to what constituted wisdom to give ones self

earnestly said he to the duties due to men and while respecting

spiritual beings to keep aloof from them may be called wisdom  at

any rate as by his frequent references to heaven instead of following the

phraseology of the older sages he gave occasion to many of his professed

followers to identify god with a principle of reason and the course of

nature so in the point now in hand he has led them to deny like the

sadducees of old the existence of any spirit at all and to tell us that their

sacrifices to the dead are but an outward form the mode of expression

which the principle of filial piety requires them to adopt when its objects

have departed this life

it will not be supposed that i wish to advocate or to defend the practice

of sacrificing to the dead my object has been to point out how confucius

recognised it without acknowledging the faith from which it must have

originated and how he enforced it as a matter of form or ceremony it thus

connects itself with the most serious charge that can be brought against

him the charge of insincerity among the four things which it is said he

taught truthfulness is specified  and many sayings might be quoted

from him in which sincerity is celebrated as highly and demanded as

stringently as ever it has been by any christian moralist yet he was not

altogether the truthful and true man to whom we accord our highest

approbation there was the case of mang chihfan who boldly brought up

the rear of the defeated troops of lu and attributed his occupying the

place of honour to the backwardness of his horse the action was gallant

but the apology for it was weak and unnecessary and yet confucius saw

nothing in the whole but matter for praise  he could excuse himself

from seeing an unwelcome visitor on the ground that he was sick when

there was nothing the matter with him  these were small matters but

what shall we say to the incident which i have given in the sketch of his

life p  his deliberately breaking the oath which he had sworn

simply on the ground that it had been forced from him



 ana vii xxiii

 ana vi xx

 see above near the beginning of this paragraph

 ana vi xiii

 am xvii xx
i should be glad if i could find evidence on which to deny the truth of

that occurrence but it rests on the same authority as most other

statements about him and it is accepted as a fact by the people and

scholars of china it must have had and it must still have a very injurious

influence upon them foreigners charge a habit of deceitfulness upon the

nation and its government on the justice or injustice of this charge i say

nothing for every word of falsehood and every act of insincerity the

guilty party must bear his own burden but we cannot but regret the

example of confucius in this particular it is with the chinese and their

sage as it was with the jews of old and their teachers he that leads them

has caused them to err and destroyed the way of their paths 

but was not insincerity a natural result of the unreligion of confucius

there are certain virtues which demand a true piety in order to their

flourishing in the heart of man natural affection the feeling of loyalty and

enlightened policy may do much to build up and preserve a family and a

state but it requires more to maintain the love of truth and make a lie

spoken or acted to be shrunk from with shame it requires in fact the

living recognition of a god of truth and all the sanctions of revealed

religion unfortunately the chinese have not had these and the example of

him to whom they bow down as the best and wisest of men does not set

them against dissimulation

 i go on to a brief discussion of confuciuss views on government or

what we may call his principles of political science it



sidebar his views on government



could not be in his long intercourse with his disciples but that he should

enunciate many maxims bearing on character and morals generally but he

never rested in the improvement of the individual the kingdom the

world brought to a state of happy tranquillity  was the grand object

which he delighted to think of that it might be brought about as easily as

one can look upon the palm of his hand was the dream which it pleased

him to indulge  he held that there was in men an adaptation and

readiness to be governed which only needed to be taken advantage of in

the proper way there must be the right administrators but given those

and the growth of government would be rapid just as vegetation is rapid

in the earth yea their



 isaiah iii 

  see the   pars   c

 ana iii xi et al
government would display itself like an easilygrowing rush  the

same sentiment was common from the lips of mencius enforcing it one

day when conversing with one of the petty rulers of his time he said in

his peculiar style does your majesty understand the way of the growing

grain during the seventh and eighth months when drought prevails the

plants become dry then the clouds collect densely in the heavens they

send down torrents of rain and the grain erects itself as if by a shoot

when it does so who can keep it back  such he contended would be

the response of the mass of the people to any true shepherd of men it

may be deemed unnecessary that i should specify this point for it is a

truth applicable to the people of all nations speaking generally

government is by no device or cunning craftiness human nature demands

it but in no other family of mankind is the characteristic so largely

developed as in the chinese the love of order and quiet and a willingness

to submit to the powers that be eminently distinguish them foreign

writers have often taken notice of this and have attributed it to the

influence of confuciuss doctrines as inculcating subordination but it

existed previous to his time the character of the people molded his

system more than it was molded by it

this readiness to be governed arose according to confucius from the

duties of universal obligation or those between sovereign and minister

between father and son between husband and wife between elder

brother and younger and those belonging to the intercourse of friends 

men as they are born into the world and grow up in it find themselves

existing in those relations they are the appointment of heaven and each

relation has its reciprocal obligations the recognition of which is proper to

the heavenconferred nature it only needs that the sacredness of the

relations be maintained and the duties belonging to them faithfully

discharged and the happy tranquillity will prevail all under heaven as to

the institutions of government the laws and arrangements by which as

through a thousand channels it should go forth to carry plenty and

prosperity through the length and breadth of the country it did not belong

to confucius the throneless king to set them forth minutely and indeed

they were existing in the records of the ancient sovereigns nothing new

was needed it was only



  xx 

 mencius i pt i vi

requisite to pursue the old paths and raise up the old standards the

government of wan and wu he said is displayed in the records the

tablets of wood and bamboo let there be the men and the government

will flourish but without the men the government decays and ceases 

to the same effect was the reply which he gave to yen hui when asked by

him how the government of a state should be administered it seems very

wide of the mark until we read it in the light of the sages veneration for

ancient ordinances and his opinion of their sufficiency follow he said

the seasons of hsia ride in the state carriages of yin wear the ceremonial

cap of chau let the music be the shao with its pantomimes banish the

songs of chang and keep far from specious talkers 

confuciuss idea then of a happy wellgoverned state did not go beyond

the flourishing of the five relations of society which have been mentioned

and we have not any condensed exhibition from him of their nature or of

the duties belonging to the several parties in them of the two first he

spoke frequently but all that he has said on the others would go into small

compass mencius has said that between father and son there should be

affection between sovereign and minister righteousness between husband

and wife attention to their separate functions between old and young a

proper order and between friends fidelity  confucius i apprehend

would hardly have accepted this account it does not bring out sufficiently

the authority which he claimed for the father and the sovereign and the

obedience which he exacted from the child and the minister with regard

to the relation of husband and wife he was in no respect superior to the

preceding sages who had enunciated their views of propriety on the

subject we have a somewhat detailed exposition of his opinions in the

narratives of the school man said he is the representative of heaven

and is supreme over all things woman yields obedience to the instructions

of man and helps to carry out his principles  on this account she can

determine nothing of herself and is subject to the rule of the three

obediences when young she must obey her father and elder brother

when married she must obey her husband

 mencius iii pt i iv 

     
when her husband is dead she must obey her son she may not think of

marrying a second time no instructions or orders must issue from the

harem womans business is simply the preparation and supplying of drink

and food beyond the threshold of her apartments she should not be

known for evil or for good she may not cross the boundaries of the state

to attend a funeral she may take no step on her own motion and may

come to no conclusion on her own deliberation there are five women who

are not to be taken in marriage the daughter of a rebellious house the

daughter of a disorderly house the daughter of a house which has

produced criminals for more than one generation the daughter of a

leprous house and the daughter who has lost her father and elder brother

a wife may be divorced for seven reasons which however may be

overruled by three considerations the grounds for divorce are

disobedience to her husbands parents not giving birth to a son dissolute

conduct jealousy of her husbands attentions that is to the other

inmates of his harem talkativeness and thieving the three

considerations which may overrule these grounds are first if while she

was taken from a home she has now no home to return to second if she

have passed with her husband through the three years mourning for his

parents third if the husband have become rich from being poor all these

regulations were adopted by the sages in harmony with the natures of

man and woman and to give importance to the ordinance of marriage 

with these ideas of the relations of society confucius dwelt much on the

necessity of personal correctness of character on the part of those in

authority in order to secure the right fulfillment of the duties implied in

them this is one grand peculiarity of his teaching i have adverted to it in

the review of the great learning but it deserves some further exhibition

and there are three conversations with the chief chi kang in which it is

very expressly set forth chi kang asked about government and confucius

replied to govern means to rectify if you lead on the people with

correctness who will dare not to be correct chi kang distressed about

the number of thieves in the state inquired of confucius about how to do

away with them confucius said if you sir were not covetous though you

should reward them to do it they would not steal chi kang asked about

government



  
saying what do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the

principled confucius replied sir in carrying on your government why

should you use killing at all let your evinced desires be for what is good

and the people will be good the relation between superiors and inferiors

is like that between the wind and the grass the grass must bend when

the wind blows across it 

example is not so powerful as confucius in these and many other

passages represented it but its influence is very great its virtue is

recognised in the family and it is demanded in the church of christ a

bishop and i quote the term with the simple meaning of overseer

must be blameless it seems to me however that in the progress of

society in the west we have come to think less of the power of example in

many departments of state than we ought to do it is thought of too little in

the army and the navy we laugh at the selfdenying ordinance and the

new model of  but there lay beneath them the principle which

confucius so broadly propounded the importance of personal virtue in

all who are in authority now that great britain is the governing power

over the masses of india and that we are coming more and more into

contact with tens of thousands of the chinese this maxim of our sage is

deserving of serious consideration from all who bear rule and especially

from those on whom devolves the conduct of affairs his words on the

susceptibility of the people to be acted on by those above them ought not

to prove as water spilt on the ground

but to return to confucius as he thus lays it down that the

mainspring of the wellbeing of society is the personal character of the

ruler we look anxiously for what directions he has given for the

cultivation of that but here he is very defective selfadjustment and

purification he said with careful regulation of his dress and the not

making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety this is the way

for the ruler to cultivate his person  this is laying too much stress on

what is external but even to attain to this is beyond unassisted human

strength confucius however never recognised a disturbance of the moral

elements in the constitution of man the people would move according to

him to the virtue of their ruler as the grass bends to the wind and that

virtue

would come to the ruler at his call many were the lamentations which

he uttered over the degeneracy of his times frequent were the confessions

which he made of his own shortcomings it seems strange that it never

came distinctly before him that there is a power of evil in the prince and

the peasant which no efforts of their own and no instructions of sages are

effectual to subdue

the government which confucius taught was a despotism but of a

modified character he allowed no jus divinum independent of

personal virtue and a benevolent rule he has not explicitly stated indeed

wherein lies the ground of the great relation of the governor and the

governed but his views on the subject were we may assume in

accordance with the language of the shuching heaven and earth are

the parents of all things and of all things men are the most intelligent the

man among them most distinguished for intelligence becomes chief ruler

and ought to prove himself the parent of the people  and again

heaven protecting the inferior people has constituted for them rulers and

teachers who should be able to be assisting to god extending favour and

producing tranquillity throughout all parts of the kingdom  the

moment the ruler ceases to be a minister of god for good and does not

administer a government that is beneficial to the people he forfeits the

title by which he holds the throne and perseverance in oppression will

surely lead to his overthrow mencius inculcated this principle with a

frequency and boldness which are remarkable it was one of the things

about which confucius did not like to talk still he held it it is conspicuous

in the last chapter of the great learning its tendency has been to check

the violence of oppression and maintain the selfrespect of the people all

along the course of chinese history

i must bring these observations on confuciuss views of government to

a close and i do so with two remarks first they are adapted to a

primitive unsophisticated state of society he is a good counsellor for the

father of a family the chief of a clan and even the head of a small

principality but his views want the comprehension which would make

them of much service in a great dominion within three centuries after his

deaththe government of china passed into a new phase the founder of

the chin dynasty conceived the grand idea of abolishing all its feudal

kingdoms and centralizing their administration in himself he effected the

revo



l  see the shuching v i sect i  
lution and succeeding dynasties adopted his system and gradually

molded it into the forms and proportions which are now existing there

has been a tendency to advance and confucius has all along been trying to

carry the nation back principles have been needed and not proprieties

the consequence is that china has increased beyond its ancient

dimensions while there has been no corresponding development of

thought its body politic has the size of a giant while it still retains the

mind of a child its hoary age is in danger of becoming but senility

second confucius makes no provision for the intercourse of his country

with other and independent nations he knew indeed of none such china

was to him the middle kingdom  the multitude of great states 

all under heaven  beyond it were only rude and barbarous tribes he

does not speak of them bitterly as many chinese have done since his time

in one place he contrasts their condition favourably with the prevailing

anarchy of the kingdom saying the rude tribes of the east and north have

their princes and are not like the states of our great land which are

without them  another time disgusted with the want of appreciation

which he experienced he was expressing his intention to go and live

among the nine wild tribes of the east some one said they are rude how

can you do such a thing his reply was if a superior man dwelt among

them what rudeness would there be  but had he been a rulersage he

would not only have influenced them by his instructions but brought them

to acknowledge and submit to his sway as the great yu did  the only

passage of confuciuss teachings from which any rule can be gathered for

dealing with foreigners is that in the doctrine of the mean where

indulgent treatment of men from a distance is laid down as one of the

nine standard rules for the government of the country  but the men

from a distance are understood to be pin and lu  simply

guests that is or officers of one state seeking employment in another or

at the royal court and visitors or travelling merchants of independent

nations the ancient classics have not any knowledge nor has confucius so

long as merchants from europe and other parts of the world could have

been content to appear in china as suppliants seeking the privilege of

trade so

long the government would have ranked them with the barbarous

hordes of antiquity and given them the benefit of the maxim about

indulgent treatment according to its own understanding of it but when

their governments interfered and claimed to treat with that of china on

terms of equality and that their subjects should be spoken to and of as

being of the same clay with the chinese themselves an outrage was

committed on tradition and prejudice which it was necessary to resent

with vehemence

i do not charge the contemptuous arrogance of the chinese government

and people upon confucius what i deplore is that he left no principles on

record to check the development of such a spirit his simple views of

society and government were in a measure sufficient for the people while

they dwelt apart from the rest of mankind his practical lessons were

better than if they had been left which but for him they probably would

have been to fall a prey to the influences of taoism and buddhism but

they could only subsist while they were left alone of the earth earthy

china was sure to go to pieces when it came into collision with a

christianlycivilized power its sage had left it no preservative or

restorative elements against such a case

it is a rude awakening from its complacency of centuries which china

has now received its ancient landmarks are swept away opinions will

differ as to the justice or injustice of the grounds on which it has been

assailed and i do not feel called to judge or to pronounce here concerning

them in the progress of events it could hardly be but that the collision

should come and when it did come it could not be but that china should be

broken and scattered disorganization will go on to destroy it more and

more and yet there is hope for the people with their veneration for the

relations of society with their devotion to learning and with their habits

of industry and sobriety there is hope for them if they will look away

from all their ancient sages and turn to him who sends them along with

the dissolution of their ancient state the knowledge of himself the only

living and true god and of jesus christ whom he hath sent

 i have little more to add on the opinions of confucius many of his

sayings are pithy and display much knowledge of character but as they

are contained in the body of the work i will not occupy the space here

with a selection of those which have struck myself as most worthy of

notice the fourth book of the analects





which is on the subject of zan or perfect virtue has several

utterances which are remarkable

thornton observes it may excite surprise and probably incredulity

to state that the golden rule of our saviour do unto others as you would

that they should do unto you which mr locke designates as the most

unshaken rule of morality and foundation of all social virtue had been

inculcated by confucius almost in the same words four centuries before

 i have taken notice of this fact in reviewing both the great learning

and the doctrine of the mean i would be far from grudging a tribute of

admiration to confucius for it the maxim occurs also twice in the analects

in book xv xxiii tszekung asks if there be one word which may serve as

a rule of practice for all ones life and is answered is not reciprocity such

a word what you do not want done to yourself do not do to others the

same disciple appears in book v xi telling confucius that he was practising

the lesson he says what i do not wish men to do to me i also wish not to

do to men but the master tells him tsze you have not attained to that it

would appear from this reply that he was aware of the difficulty of

obeying the precept  and it is not found in its condensed expression at

least in the older classics the merit of it is confuciuss own

when a comparison however is drawn between it and the rule laid

down by christ it is proper to call attention to the positive form of the

latter all things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye

even so to them the lesson of the gospel commands men to do what they

feel to be right and good it requires them to commence a course of such

conduct without regard to the conduct of others to themselves the lesson

of confucius only forbids men to do what they feel to be wrong and

hurtful so far as the point of priority is concerned moreover christ adds

this is the law and the prophets the maxim was to be found

substantially in the earlier revelations of god still it must be allowed that

confucius was well aware of the importance of taking the initiative in

discharging all the relations of society see his words as quoted from the

doctrine of the mean on pages   above but the worth of the two

maxims depends on the intention of the enunciators in regard to their

application confucius it seems to me did not think of the reciprocity

coming into action beyond the circle of his five relations of society

possibly he might have



 history of china vol i p 
required its observance in dealings even with the rude tribes which

were the only specimens of mankind besides his own countrymen of which

he knew anything for on one occasion when asked about perfect virtue

he replied it is in retirement to be sedately grave in the management of

business to be reverently attentive in intercourse with others to be

strictly sincere though a man go among the rude uncultivated tribes

these qualities may not be neglected  still confucius delivered his rule

to his countrymen only and only for their guidance in their relations of

which i have had so much occasion to speak the rule of christ is for man

as man having to do with other men all with himself on the same

platform as the children and subjects of the one god and father in heaven

how far short confucius came of the standard of christian benevolence

may be seen from his remarks when asked what was to be thought of the

principle that injury should be recompensed with kindness he replied

with what then will you recompense kindness recompense injury with

justice and recompense kindness with kindness  the same deliverance

is given in one of the books of the li chi where he adds that he who

recompenses injury with kindness is a man who is careful of his person

 chang hsuan the commentator of the second century says that such a

course would be incorrect in point of propriety  this propriety was a

great stumblingblock in the way of confucius his morality was the result

of the balancings of his intellect fettered by the decisions of men of old

and not the gushings of a loving heart responsive to the promptings of

heaven and in sympathy with erring and feeble humanity

this subject leads me on to the last of the opinions of confucius which i

shall make the subject of remark in this place a commentator observes

with reference to the inquiry about recompensing injury with kindness

that the questioner was asking only about trivial matters which might be

dealt with in the way he mentioned while great offences such as those

against a sovereign or a father could not be dealt with by such an

inversion of the principles of justice  in the second book of the li chi

there is the following passage with the slayer of his father a man may

not live under the same heaven against the slayer of his brother a man

must never have to go home to fetch a weapon with the slayer of



 ana xiii xix

 ana xiv xxxvi

 see notes in loc p 
his friend a man may not live in the same state  the lex

talionis is here laid down in its fullest extent the chau li tells us of a

provision made against the evil consequences of the principle by the

appointment of a minister called the reconciler  the provision is very

inferior to the cities of refuge which were set apart by moses for the

manslayer to flee to from the fury of the avenger such as it was however

it existed and it is remarkable that confucius when consulted on the

subject took no notice of it but affirmed the duty of bloodrevenge in the

strongest and most unrestricted terms his disciple tszehsia asked him

what course is to be pursued in the case of the murder of a father or

mother he replied the son must sleep upon a matting of grass with his

shield for his pillow he must decline to take office he must not live under

the same heaven with the slayer when he meets him in the marketplace

or the court he must have his weapon ready to strike him and what is

the course on the murder of a brother the surviving brother must not

take office in the same state with the slayer yet if he go on his princes

service to the state where the slayer is though he meet him he must not

fight with him and what is the course on the murder of an uncle or a

cousin in this case the nephew or cousin is not the principal if the

principal on whom the revenge devolves can take it he has only to stand

behind with his weapon in his hand and support him 

sir john davis has rightly called attention to this as one of the

objectionable principles of confucius  the bad effects of it are evident

even in the present day revenge is sweet to the chinese i have spoken of

their readiness to submit to government and wish to live in peace yet

they do not like to resign even to government the inquisition for blood

where the ruling authority is feeble as it is at present individuals and

clans take the law into their own hands and whole districts are kept in a

state of constant feud and warfare

but i must now leave the sage i hope i have not done him injustice the

more i have studied his character and opinions the more highly have i

come to regard him he was a very great man and his influence has been

on the whole a great benefit to the chinese while his teachings suggest

important lessons to ourselves who profess to belong to the school of

christ

his immediate disciples
szema chien makes confucius say the disciples who received my

instructions and could themselves comprehend them were seventyseven

individuals they were all scholars of extraordinary ability  the

common saying is that the disciples of the sage were three thousand while

among them there were seventytwo worthies i propose to give here a list

of all those whose names have come down to us as being his followers of

the greater number it will be seen that we know nothing more than their

names and surnames my principal authorities will be the historical

records the narratives of the school the sacrificial canon for the sages

temple with plates and the chapter on the disciples of confucius

prefixed to the four books text and commentary with proofs and

illustrations in giving a few notices of the betterknown individuals i

will endeavour to avoid what may be gathered from the analects

 yen hui by designation tszeyuan   he was a native of

lu the favourite of his master whose junior he was by thirty years and

whose disciple he became when he was quite a youth after i got hui

confucius remarked the disciples came closer to me we are told that

once when he found himself on the nang hill with hui tszelu and tsze

kung confucius asked them to tell him their different aims and he would

choose between them tszelu began and when he had done the master

said it marks your bravery tszekung followed on whose words the

judgment was they show your discriminating eloquence at last came

yen yuan who said i should like to find an intelligent king and sage ruler

whom i might assist i would diffuse among the people instructions on the

five great points and lead them on by the rules of propriety and music so

that they should not care to fortify their cities by walls and moats but

would fuse their swords and spears into implements of agriculture they

should send forth their flocks without fear into the plains and forests

there should be no sunderings of families no widows or widowers for a

thousand



    
years there would be no calamity of war yu would have no opportunity

to display his bravery or tsze to display his oratory the master

pronounced how admirable is this virtue

when hui was twentynine his hair was all white and in three years

more he died he was sacrificed to along with confucius by the first

emperor of the han dynasty the title which he now has in the sacrificial

canon continuator of the sage was conferred in the ninth year of the

emperor or to speak more correctly of the period chiaching a d 

almost all the present sacrificial titles of the worthies in the temple were

fixed at that time huis place is the first of the four assessors on the east

of the sage 

 min sun styled tszechien  he was a native of lu

fifteen years younger than confucius according to szema chien but fifty

years younger according to the narratives of the school which latter

authority is followed in the annals of the empire when he first came to

confucius we are told he had a starved look  which was byandby

exchanged for one of fulness and satisfaction  tszekung asked him how

the change had come about he replied i came from the midst of my reeds

and sedges into the school of the master he trained my mind to filial piety

and set before me the examples of the ancient kings i felt a pleasure in his

instructions but when i went abroad and saw the people in authority

with their umbrellas and banners and all the pomp and circumstance of

their trains i also felt pleasure in that show these two things assaulted

each other in



 i have referred briefly at p  to the temples of confucius the

principal hall called  or hall of the great and complete one is that

in which is his own statue or the tablet of his spirit having on each side of

it within a screen the statues or tablets of his four assessors on the

east and west along the walls of the same apartment are the two  the

places of the  or twelve wise ones those of his disciples who next

to the assessors are counted worthy of honour outside this apartment

and running in a line with the two  but along the external wall of the

sacred inclosure are the two  or sidegalleries which i have sometimes

called the ranges of the outer court in each there are sixtyfour tablets of

the disciples and other worthies having the same title as the wise ones

that of  or ancient worthy or the inferior title of  ancient

scholar behind the principal hall is the  sacred to confuciuss

ancestors whose tablets are in the centre fronting the south like that of

confucius on each side are likewise the tablets of certain ancient

worthies and ancient scholars

 

 
my breast i could not determine which to prefer and so i wore that

look of distress but now the lessons of our master have penetrated deeply

into my mind my progress also has been helped by the example of you my

fellowdisciples i now know what i should follow and what i should avoid

and all the pomp of power is no more to me than the dust of the ground it

is on this account that i have that look of fulness and satisfaction tsze

chien was high in confuciuss esteem he was distinguished for his purity

and filial affection his place in the temple is the first east among the

wise ones immediately after the four assessors he was first sacrificed to

along with confucius as is to be understood of the other wise ones

excepting in the case of yu zo in the eighth year of the style kaiyuan of

the sixth emperor of the tang dynasty ad  his title the same as that

of all but the assessors is the ancient worthy the philosopher min

  zan kang styled poniu   al   he was a native of

lu and confuciuss junior only by seven years when confucius became

minister of crime he appointed poniu to the office which he had himself

formerly held of commandant of chungtu his tablet is now fourth among

the wise ones on the west

 zan yung styled chungkung   he was of the same clan as

zan kang and twentynine years younger than confucius he had a bad

father but the master declared that was not to be counted to him to

detract from his admitted excellence his place is among the wise ones

the second east

 zan chiu styled tszeyu   he was related to the two

former and of the same age as chungkung he was noted among the

disciples for his versatile ability and many acquirements tszekung said

of him respectful to the old and kind to the young attentive to guests

and visitors fond of learning and skilled in many arts diligent in his

examination of things these are what belong to zan chiu it has been

noted in the life of confucius that it was by the influence of tszeyu that

he was finally restored to lu he occupies the third place west among the

wise ones

 chung yu styled tszelu and chilu    he was a

native of pien  in lu and only





nine years younger than confucius at their first interview the master

asked him what he was fond of and he replied my long sword confucius

said if to your present ability there were added the results of learning

you would be a very superior man of what advantage would learning be

to me asked tszelu there is a bamboo on the southern hill which is

straight itself without being bent if you cut it down and use it you can

send it through a rhinoceross hide what is the use of learning yes

said the master but if you feather it and point it with steel will it not

penetrate more deeply tszelu bowed  twice and said i will reverently

receive your instructions confucius was wont to say from the time that i

got yu bad words no more came to my ears for some time tszelu was

chief magistrate of the district of pu  where his administration

commanded the warm commendations of the master he died finally in

wei as has been related above pp   his tablet is now the fourth

east from those of the assessors

 tsai yu styled tszewo   he was a native of lu but

nothing is mentioned of his age he had a sharp mouth according to sze

ma chien once when he was at the court of chu on some commission the

king chao offered him an easy carriage adorned with ivory for his master

yu replied my master is a man who would rejoice in a government where

right principles were carried out and can find his joy in himself when that

is not the case now right principles and virtue are as it were in a state of

slumber his wish is to rouse and put them in motion could he find a

prince really anxious to rule according to them he would walk on foot to

his court and be glad to do so why need he receive such a valuable gift as

this from so great a distance confucius commended this reply but where

he is mentioned in the analects tszewo does not appear to great

advantage he took service in the state of chi and was chief magistrate of

lintsze where he joined with tien chang in some disorderly movement

 which led to the destruction of his kindred and made confucius

ashamed of him his tablet is now the second west among the wise ones

 twanmu tsze styled tszekung   al  whose

place is now third east from the assessors he



  see szema chiens biographies chap  though come have

doubted the genuineness of this part of the notice of tszewo
was a native of wei  and thirtyone years younger than confucius

he had great quickness of natural ability and appears in the analects as

one of the most forward talkers among the disciples confucius used to say

from the time that i got tsze scholars from a distance came daily

resorting to me several instances of the language which he used to

express his admiration of the master have been given in the last section

here is another the duke ching of chi asked tszekung how chungni

was to be ranked as a sage i do not know was the reply i have all my

life had the heaven over my head but i do not know its height and the

earth under my feet but i do not know its thickness in my serving of

confucius i am like a thirsty man who goes with his pitcher to the river

and there he drinks his fill without knowing the rivers depth he took

leave of confucius to become commandant of hsinyang  when the

master said to him in dealing with your subordinates there is nothing

like impartiality and when wealth comes in your way there is nothing like

moderation hold fast these two things and do not swerve from them to

conceal mens excellence is to obscure the worthy and to proclaim peoples

wickedness is the part of a mean man to speak evil of those whom you

have not sought the opportunity to instruct is not the way of friendship

and harmony subsequently tszekung was high in office both in lu and

wei and finally died in chi we saw how he was in attendance on

confucius at the time of the sages death many of the disciples built huts

near the masters grave and mourned for him three years but tszekung

remained sorrowing alone for three years more

 yen yen styled tszeyu   now the fourth in the western

range of the wise ones he was a native of wu  fortyfive years

younger than confucius and distinguished for his literary acquirements

being made commandant of wuchang he transformed the character of

the people by proprieties and music and was praised by the master

after the death of confucius chi kang asked yen how that event had made

no sensation like that which was made by the death of tszechan when

the men laid aside their bowstring rings and girdle ornaments and the

women laid aside their pearls and earrings and the voice of weeping was

heard in the lanes for three months yen replied the influences of tsze

chan and my master might be compared





to those of overflowing water and the fattening rain wherever the

water in its overflow reaches men take knowledge of it while the

fattening rain falls unobserved

 pu shang styled tszehsia   it is not certain to what

state he belonged his birth being assigned to wei  to wei  and to

wan  he was fortyfive years younger than confucius and lived to a

great age for we find him bc  at the court of the prince wan of wei 

 to whom he gave copies of some of the classical books he is

represented as a scholar extensively read and exact but without great

comprehension of mind what is called maos shihching  is said to

contain the views of tszehsia kungyang kao and kuliang chih are also

said to have studied the chun chiu with him on the occasion of the death

of his son he wept himself blind his place is the fifth east among the

wise ones

 chwansun shih styled tszechang   has his tablet

corresponding to that of the preceding on the west he was a native of

chan  and fortyeight years younger than confucius tszekung said

not to boast of his admirable merit not to signify joy on account of noble

station neither insolent nor indolent showing no pride to the dependent

these are the characteristics of chwansun shih when he was sick he

called his son shanhsiang to him and said we speak of his end in

the case of a superior man and of his death in the case of a mean

man may i think that it is going to be the former with me today

 tsang shan or tsan styled tszeyu   al  he

was a native of south wuchang and fortysix years younger than

confucius in his sixteenth year he was sent by his father into chu where

confucius then was to learn under the sage excepting perhaps yen hui

there is not a name of greater note in the confucian school tszekung said

of him there is no subject which he has not studied his appearance is

respectful his virtue is solid his words command credence before great

men he draws himself up in the pride of selfrespect his eyebrows are

those of longevity he was noted for his filial piety and after the death of

his parents he could not read the rites of mourning without being led to

think of them and moved to tears he was a voluminous writer ten books

of his composition are said to be contained in the rites of the elder tai





 the classic of filial piety he is said to have made under the eye

of confucius on his connexion with the great learning see above ch iii

sect ii he was first associated with the sacrifices to confucius in ad 

but in  he was advanced to be one of the sages four assessors his

title exhibitor of the fundamental principles of the sage dates from the

period of chiaching as mentioned in speaking of yen hui

 tantai miehming styled tszeyu   he was a

native of wuchang thirtynine years younger than confucius according

to the historical records but fortynine according to the narratives of

the school he was excessively ugly and confucius thought meanly of his

talents in consequence on his first application to him after completing his

studies he travelled to the south as far as the yangtsze traces of his

presence in that part of the country are still pointed out in the department

of suchau he was followed by about three hundred disciples to whom he

laid down rules for their guidance in their intercourse with the princes

when confucius heard of his success he confessed how he had been led by

his bad looks to misjudge him he with nearly all the disciples whose

names follow first had a place assigned to him in the sacrifices to

confucius in ad  the place of his tablet is the second east in the

outer court beyond that of the assessors and wise ones

 corresponding to the preceding on the west is the tablet of fu

puchi styled tszetsien  al  and  all     he

was a native of lu and according to different accounts thirty forty and

fortynine years younger than confucius he was commandant of tanfu 

 and hardly needed to put forth any personal effort wuma chi

had been in the same office and had succeeded by dint of the greatest

industry and toil he asked puchi how he managed so easily for himself

and was answered i employ men you employ mens strength people

pronounced fu to be a superior man he was also a writer and his works

are mentioned in liu hsins catalogue

 next to that of miehming is the tablet of yuan hsien styled tsze

sze   a native of sung or according to chang hsuan of lu and

younger than confucius by thirtysix years he was noted for his purity

and modesty and for his





happiness in the principles of the master amid deep poverty after the

death of confucius he lived in obscurity in wei in the notes to ana vi iii

i have referred to an interview which he had with tszekung

 kungye chang al chih styled tszechang al tsze

chih  al   al  has his tablet next to that

of puchi he was soninlaw to confucius his nativity is assigned both to

lu and to chi

 nankung kwo styled tszeyung  al  and in the

narratives of the school  tao  has the place at the east next to

yuan hsien it is a question much debated whether he was the same with

nankung changshu who accompanied confucius to the court of chau or

not on occasion of a fire breaking out in the palace of duke ai while

others were intent on securing the contents of the treasury nankung

directed his efforts to save the library and to him was owing the

preservation of the copy of the chau li which was in lu and other ancient

monuments

 kunghsi ai styled chitsze al chichan  

al  his tablet follows that of kungye he was a native of lu or

of chi confucius commended him for refusing to take office with any of

the families which were encroaching on the authority of the princes of the

states and for choosing to endure the severest poverty rather than

sacrifice a tittle of his principles

 tsang tien styled hsi al   he was the father of

tsang shan his place in the temples is the hall to confuciuss ancestors

where his tablet is the first west

 yen wuyao styled lu   he was the father of yen hui

younger than confucius by six years his sacrificial place is the first east

in the same hall as the last

 following the tablet of nankung kwo is that of shang chu styled

tszemu   to him it is said we are indebted for the

preservation of the yiching which he received from confucius its

transmission step by step from chu down to the han dynasty is minutely

set forth

chikao   al  for  moreover we find  and  a

native of chi according to the narratives





of the school but of wei according to szema chien and chang hsuan

he was thirty some say forty years younger than confucius dwarfish and

ugly but of great worth and ability at one time he was criminal judge of

wei and in the execution of his office condemned a prisoner to lose his

feet afterwards that same man saved his life when he was flying from

the state confucius praised chai for being able to administer stern justice

with such a spirit of benevolence as to disarm resentment

 shang chu is followed by chitiao kai prop chi styled tszekai

tszezo and tszehsiu  pr    and  a native of

tsai  or according to chang hsuan of lu we only know him as a

reader of the shuching and refusing to go into office

 kungpo liao styled tszechau   he appears in the

analects xiv xxxiii slandering tszelu it is doubtful whether he should

have a place among the disciples

 szema kang styled tszeniu   follows chitiao kai

also styled  he was a great talker a native of sung and a brother of

hwan tui to escape from whom seems to have been the labour of his life

 the place next kao chai is occupied by fan hsu styled tszechih 

  a native of chi or according to others of lu and whose age is

given as thirtysix and fortysix years younger than confucius when

young he distinguished himself in a military command under the chi

family

 yu zo styled tszezo   he was a native of lu and his age

is stated very variously he was noted among the disciples for his great

memory and fondness for antiquity after the death of confucius the rest

of the disciples because of some likeness in zos speech to the master

wished to render the same observances to him which they had done to

confucius but on tsang shans demurring to the thing they abandoned the

purpose the tablet of tszezo is now the sixth east among the wise ones

to which place it was promoted in the third year of chienlung of the

present dynasty this was done in compliance with a memorial from the

president of one of the boards who said he was moved by a dream to

make the request we may suppose that his real motives were a wish to do

justice to the merits of tszezo and to restore the symmetry of the tablets

in the hall of the





great and complete one which had been disturbed by the introduction

of the tablet of chu hsi in the preceding reign

 kunghsi chih styled tszehwa   a native of lu

younger than confucius by fortytwo years whose place is the fourth

west in the outer court he was noted for his knowledge of ceremonies

and the other disciples devolved on him all the arrangements about the

funeral of the master

 wuma shih or chi styled tszechi  al  

al  a native of chan or according to chang hsuan of lu thirty

years younger than confucius his tablet is on the east next to that of

szema kang it is related that on one occasion when confucius was about

to set out with a company of the disciples on a walk or journey he told

them to take umbrellas they met with a heavy shower and wuma asked

him saying there were no clouds in the morning but after the sun had

risen you told us to take umbrellas how did you know that it would rain

confucius said the moon last evening was in the constellation pi and is it

not said in the shihching when the moon is in pi there will be heavy

rain it was thus i knew it

 liang chan al li styled shuyu  al   occupies

the eighth place west among the tablets of the outer court he was a man

of chi and his age is stated as twentynine and thirtynine years younger

than confucius the following story is told in connexion with him when

he was thirty being disappointed that he had no son he was minded to

put away his wife do not do so said shang chu to him i was thirtyeight

before i had a son and my mother was then about to take another wife for

me when the master proposed sending me to chi my mother was

unwilling that i should go but confucius said dont be anxious chu will

have five sons after he is forty it has turned out so and i apprehend it is

your fault and not your wifes that you have no son yet chan took this

advice and in the second year after he had a son

 yen hsing al hsin liu and wei styled tszeliu  al

  and   occupies the place east after wuma shih he was a

native of lu and fortysix years younger than confucius

 liang chan is followed on the west by zan zu styled tszelu

 digitizers note this is  in the source text i have corrected what is

an obvious misprint
and  a native of lu and fifty years younger than confucius

 yen hsing is followed on the east by tsao hsu styled tszehsun 

  a native of tsai fifty years younger than confucius

 next on the west is po chien styled tszehsi or in the current

copies of the narratives of the school tszechiai   al 

 or  a native of lu fifty years younger than confucius

 following tszehsun is kungsun lung al chung styled tsze

shih  al   whose birth is assigned by different

writers to wei chu and chao  he was fiftythree years younger than

confucius we have the following account tszekung asked tszeshih

saying have you not learned the book of poetry tszeshih replied

what leisure have i to do so my parents require me to be filial my

brothers require me to be submissive and my friends require me to be

sincere what leisure have i for anything else come to my master said

tszekung and learn of him

chapter vi

list of the principal works which have been consulted in

the preparation of this volume



section i

chinese works with brief notices
 the thirteen ching with commentary and explanations

this is the great repertory of ancient lore upon the classics on the

analects it contains the collection of explanations of the lun yu by ho

yen and others see p  and the correct meaning or paraphrase of

hsing ping see p  on the great learning and the doctrine of the mean

it contains the comments and glosses of chang hsuan and of kung yingta

 of the tang dynasty

 a new edition of the four books punctuated and

annotated for reading this work was published in the seventh year of

taokwang  by a kao lin  it is the finest edition of the four

books which i have seen in point of typographical execution it is indeed a

volume for reading it contains the ordinary collected comments of chu

hsi on the analects and his chapters and sentences of the great learning

and doctrine of the mean the editors own notes are at the top and bottom

of the page in rubric

 the proper meaning of the four books as determined

by chu hsi compared with and illustrated from other commentators

this is a most voluminous work published in the tenth year of chienlung

ad  by wang puching  a member of the hanlin college on

the great learning and the doctrine of the mean the queries 

addressed to chu hsi and his replies are given in the same text as the

standard commentary

 the four books text and commentary with proofs and

illustrations the copy of this work which i have was edited by a wang

tingchi  in the third





 year of chiaching ad  it may be called a commentary on the

commentary the research in all matters of geography history biography

natural history c is immense

 a collection of the most important comments of scholars

on the four books by li peilin  published in the fiftyseventh

kanghsi year ad  this work is about as voluminous as the 

but on a different plan every chapter is preceded by a critical discussion

of its general meaning and the logical connexion of its several paragraphs

this is followed by the text and chu hsis standard commentary we have

then a paraphrase full and generally perspicuous next there is a selection

of approved comments from a great variety of authors and finally the

reader finds a number of critical remarks and ingenious views differing

often from the common interpretation which are submitted for his

examination

 a supplemental commentary and literary discussions on

the four books by chang chantao al tian  al 

a member of the hanlin college in the early part apparently of the reign

of chienlung the work is on a peculiar plan the reader is supposed to be

acquainted with chu hsis commentary which is not given but the author

generally supports his views and defends them against the criticisms of

some of the early scholars of this dynasty his own exercitations are of the

nature of essays more than of commentary it is a book for the student

who is somewhat advanced rather than for the learner i have often

perused it with interest and advantage

 the four books according to the commentary with

paraphrase published in the eighth year of yung chang ad  by

wang fu al kehfu  al  every page is divided into

two parts below we have the text and chu hsis commentary above we

have an analysis of every chapter followed by a paraphrase of the several

paragraphs to the paraphrase of each paragraph are subjoined critical

notes digested from a great variety of scholars but without the mention of

their names a list of  is given who are thus laid under contribution in

addition there are maps and illustrative figures at the commencement

and to each book there are prefixed biographical notices explanations of

peculiar allusions c

 the four books with a





 complete digest of supplements to the commentary and additional

suggestions a new edition with additions by tu tingchi 

published ad  the original of this work was by tang lin  a

scholar of the ming dynasty it is perhaps the best of all editions of the

four books for a learner each page is divided into three parts below is

the text divided into sentences and members of sentences which are

followed by short glosses the text is followed by the usual commentary

and that by a paraphrase to which are subjoined the supplements and

suggestions the middle division contains a critical analysis of the chapters

and paragraphs and above there are the necessary biographical and other

notes

 the four books with the relish of the radical meaning this

is a new work published in  it is the production of chin chang

styled chiutan   an officer and scholar who returning

apparently to canton province from the north in  occupied his

retirement with reviewing his literary studies of former years and

employed his sons to transcribe his notes the writer is fully up in all the

commentaries on the classics and pays particular attention to the labours

of the scholars of the present dynasty to the analects for instance there

is prefixed chiang yungs history of confucius with criticisms on it by the

author himself each chapter is preceded by a critical analysis then

follows the text with the standard commentary carefully divided into

sentences often with glosses original and selected between them to the

commentary there succeeds a paraphrase which is not copied by the

author from those of his predecessors after the paraphrase we have

explanations  the book is beautifully printed and in small type so that

it is really a multum in parvo with considerable freshness

 a paraphrase for daily lessons explaining the meaning of

the four books this work was produced in  by a department of the

members of the hanlin college in obedience to an imperial rescript the

paraphrase is full perspicuous and elegant

      these

works form together a superb edition of the five ching published by

imperial authority





 in the kanghsi and yungchang reigns they contain the standard

views  various opinions  critical decisions of the editors  

prolegomena plates or cuts and other apparatus for the student

 the collected writings of mao hsiho see prolegomena

p  the voluminousness of his writings is understated there of  or

writings on the classics there are  sections while his  or other

literary compositions amount to  sections his treatises on the great

learning and the doctrine of the mean have been especially helpful to me

he is a great opponent of chu hsi and would be a much more effective one

if he possessed the same graces of style as that prince of literature

 a collection of supplemental observations on the four

books the preface of the author tsao chihshang  is dated in

 the last year of the reign of chienlung the work contains what we

may call prolegomena on each of the four books and then excursus on the

most difficult and disputed passages the tone is moderate and the

learning displayed extensive and solid the views of chu hsi are frequently

well defended from the assaults of mao hsiho i have found the work

very instructive

 on the tenth book of the analects with plates this work was

published by the author chiang yung  in the twentyfirst chienlung

year ad  when he was seventysix years old it is devoted to the

illustration of the above portion of the analects and is divided into ten

sections the first of which consists of woodcuts and tables the second

contains the life of confucius of which i have largely availed myself in the

preceding chapter the whole is a remarkable specimen of the minute care

with which chinese scholars have illustrated the classical books

    we may call these

volumes the topography of the four books with three supplements

the authors name is yen zochu  the first volume was published

in  and the second in  i have not been able to find the dates of

publication of the other two in which there is more biographical and

general matter than topographical the author apologizes for the

inappropriateness of their titles by saying that he could not





 help calling them supplements to the topography which was his first

love

 explanations of the classics under the imperial tsing

dynasty see above p  the work however was not published as i

have there supposed by imperial authority but under the

superintendence and at the expense aided by other officers of yuan

yuan  governorgeneral of kwangtung and kwanghsi in the ninth

year of the last reign  the publication of so extensive a work shows

a public spirit and zeal for literature among the high officers of china

which should keep foreigners from thinking meanly of them

 sayings of the confucian family family is to be taken in the

sense of sect or school in liu hsins catalogue in the subdivision devoted

to the lun yu we find the entry sayings of the confucian family

twentyseven books with a note by yen szeku of the tang dynasty

not the existing work called the family sayings the original work was

among the treasures found in the wall of confuciuss old house and was

deciphered and edited by kung ankwo the present work is by wang su

of the wei  dynasty grounded professedly on the older one the blocks

of which had suffered great dilapidation during the intervening centuries

it is allowed also that since sus time the work has suffered more than

any of the acknowledged classics yet it is a very valuable fragment of

antiquity and it would be worth while to incorporate it with the analects

my copy is the edition of li yung  published in  i have

generally called the work narratives of the school

 sacrificial canon of the sages temples with plates this

work published in  by ku yuan styled hsiangchau   is a

very painstaking account of all the names sacrificed to in the temples of

confucius the dates of their attaining to that honour c there are

appended to it memoirs of confucius and mencius which are not of so

much value

 the complete works of the ten tsze see morrisons

dictionary under the character  i have only had occasion in connexion

with this work to refer to the writings of chwangtsze  and liehtsze

 my copy is an edition of 





 a cyclopdia of surnames or biographical

dictionary of the famous men and virtuous women of the successive

dynasties this is a very notable work of its class published in  by 

 and extending through  chapters or books

 general examination of records and scholars this astonishing

work which cost its author ma twanlin  twenty years labour

was first published in  rmusat says this excellent work is a

library in itself and if chinese literature possessed no other the language

would be worth learning for the sake of reading this alone it does indeed

display all but incredible research into every subject connected with the

government history literature religion c of the empire of china the

authors researches are digested in  books i have had occasion to

consult principally those on the literary monuments embraced in

seventysix books from the th to the th

 an examination of the commentaries on the classics by

chu itsun the author was a member of the hanlin college and the work

was first published with an imperial preface by the chienlung emperor

it is an exhaustive work on the literature of the classics in  chapters or

books

 a continuation of the general examination of records and

scholars this work which is in  books and nearly as extensive as the

former was the production of wang chi  who dates his preface in

 the fourteenth year of wanli the style of the reign of the

fourteenth emperor of the ming dynasty wang chi brings down the work

of his predecessor to his own times he also frequently goes over the same

ground and puts things in a clearer light i have found this to be the case

in the chapters on the classical and other books

 the twentyfour histories these are the imperially

authorized records of the empire commencing with the historical records

the work of szema chien and ending with the history of the ming

dynasty which appeared in  the result of the joint labours of 

officers and scholars of the present dynasty the extent of the collection

may be understood from this that my copy bound in english fashion

makes sixtythree volumes each one larger than this no nation has a

history so thoroughly digested and on the whole it is trustworthy in pre





paring this volume my necessities have been confined mostly to the

works of szema chien and his successor pan ku  the historian of

the first han dynasty

 the annals of the nation published by imperial authority in

 the eighth year of chiaching this work is invaluable to a student

being indeed a collection of chronological tables where every year from

the rise of the chau dynasty bc  has a distinct column to itself in

which in different compartments the most important events are noted

beyond that date it ascends to nearly the commencement of the cycles in

the sixtyfirst year of hwangti giving  not every year but the years of

which anything has been mentioned in history from hwangti also it

ascends through the dateless ages up to panku the first of mortal

sovereigns

 the boundaries of the nation in the successive dynasties

this work by the same author and published in  does for the

boundaries of the empire the same service which the preceding renders to

its chronology

 the topography of the nation in the successive dynasties

another work by the same author and of the same date as the preceding




the dictionaries chiefly consulted have been

the wellknown shwo wan  by hsu shan styled shuchung 

  published in ad  with the supplement  by hsu

chieh  of the southern tang dynasty the characters are arranged in

the shwo wan under  keys or radicals as they are unfortunately

termed

the liu shu ku  by tai tung styled chungta   of

our thirteenth century the characters are arranged in it somewhat after

the fashion of the r ya p  under six general divisions which again

are subdivided according to the affinity of subjects into various

categories

the tsze hui  which appeared in the wanli  reign of the

ming dynasty  the  radicals of the shwo wan were

reduced in this to  at which number they have since continued

the kanghsi tsze tien  or kanghsi dictionary prepared by

order of the great kanghsi emperor in  this





is the most common and complete of all chinese dictionaries for

common use

the i wan pi lan  a complete exhibition of all the authorized

characters published in  furnishing says dr williams good

definitions of all the common characters whose ancient forms are

explained

the pei wan yun fu  generally known among foreigners as

the kanghsi thesaurus it was undertaken by an imperial order and

published in  being probably as wylie says the most extensive work

of a lexicographical character ever produced it does for the phraseology

of chinese literature all and more than all that the kanghsi dictionary

does for the individual characters the arrangement of the characters is

according to their tones and final sounds my copy of it with a supplement

published about ten years later is in fortyfive large volumes with much

more letterpress in it than the edition of the dynastic histories mentioned

on p 

the ching tsi tswan ku ping pu wei  a digest

of the meanings in the classical and other books with supplement by or

rather under the superintendence of yuan yuan p  this has often

been found useful it is arranged according to the tones and rhymes like

the characters in the thesaurus

introduction
confucius was born in the year  bc in the land of lu in a

small village situated in the western part of the modern province of

shantung his name was kung chiu and his style corresponding to

our christian name was chungni his countrymen speak of him as kung

futzu the master or philosopher kung this expression was altered

into confucius by the jesuit missionaries who first carried his fame

to europe
since the golden days of the emperors yao and shun the legendary

founders of the chinese empire nearly two thousand years had passed

shun chose as his successor y who had been his chief minister a man

whose devotion to duty was such that when engaged in draining the

empire of the great flooda task that took eight years to

accomplishhe never entered his home till the work was done although

in the course of his labours he had thrice to pass his door he

founded the hsia dynasty which lasted till  bc the last emperor

of this line a vile tyrant was overthrown by tang who became the

first ruler of the house of shang or yin this dynasty again

degenerated in course of time and came to an end in chou or chou hsin

viii bc a monster of lust extravagance and cruelty the

empire was only held together by the strength and wisdom of the duke

of chou or king wen to give him his popular title one of the

greatest men in chinese history he controlled twothirds of the

empire but believing that the people were not yet ready for a

change he refrained from dethroning the emperor in his day the

husbandman paid one in nine the pay of the officers was hereditary

men were questioned at barriers and at markets but there were no

tolls fishgarths were not preserved the children of criminals were

sackless the old and wifelessthe widower the old and

husbandlessthe widow the old and childlessthe lone one the young

and fatherlessthe orphan these four are the people most in need

below heaven and they have no one to whom to cry so when king wen

reigned his love went out first to them mencius book ii chapter

 after his death his son king wu decided that the nation was

ripe for change he overcame chou hsin by force of arms and placing

himself on the throne became the founder of the chou dynasty
in the time of confucius the chou dynasty still filled the throne but

it had long since become effete and all power had passed into the

hands of the great vassals the condition of china was much like that

of germany in the worst days of the holy roman empire the emperor was

powerless the various vassal states were independent in all but name

and often at war one with the other these states again were

ixdisintegrated and their rulers impotent against encroaching

feudatories in confucius native state lu the duke was a mere

shadow the younger branches of his house had usurped all power three

in number they were called the three clans the most important of the

three was the chi or chisun clan whose chiefs chi huan and chi

kang are often mentioned by confucius but the power of the chi too

was illsecured the minister yang huo overawed his master and once

even threw him into prison nor was the condition of the other states

of the empire better than that of lu confucius thought it worse
into this turbulent world confucius was born though his father was

only a poor military officer he could trace his descent from the

imperial house of yin confucius married at nineteen and is known to

have had one son and one daughter shortly after his marriage he

entered the service of the state as keeper of the granary a year

later he was put in charge of the public fields in  bc his

mother died and in obedience to chinese custom he had to retire

from public life when the years of mourning were over he did not

again take office but devoted himself instead to study and teaching

as the years rolled by his fame grew and a band of pupils gathered

round him in  bc the anarchy in lu reached such a pitch that

confucius moved to the neighbouring land of chi here he had several

interviews with the reigning duke but met with little encouragement

xviii  so he soon returned to his native country and resumed for

fifteen years his work as student and teacherx
during these fifteen years the power of the duke sank lower and lower

and the chi was menaced by his minister yang huo in times so dark

men that loved quiet sought in the world of thought an escape from the

gloom around them whilst others that were less resigned turned over

in their minds the causes of the realms decay laotzu the founder

of the mystic taoist philosophy taught that in inaction alone peace

can be found motzu proclaimed the doctrine of universal love that

we should love all men as we love self love the parents of others as

we love our own parents upright men were driven or fled from the

world confucius often met them in his wanderings and was reproved

for not doing as they did but his practical mind told him that

inaction could not help the world and that to find a remedy for the

nations ills their cause must first be learned this could only be

done by historical study he therefore devoted himself to the study of

past times edited in later life the book of history and compiled

the work called spring and autumn a history of his native state

from  to  bc to bring again the golden days of yao and shun a

return must be made to the principles of wen and wu the kings that

had rebuilt the empire after tyranny and selfishness had laid it low

of impracticable ideals and renunciation of the world no good could

come
at last in  bc yang huo was forced to flee from lu and prospects

brightened a year later confucius was appointed governor of a town

soxi great was his success as governor that before long he was promoted

to be superintendent of works and then to be chief criminal judge he

won great influence with his master and did much to lighten the

general misery he so strengthened the power of the duke that

neighbouring states grew jealous to sow dissension between duke and

minister the men of chi sent the duke a gift of singing girls such

joy they gave him that for three days no court was held on this

confucius left the land  bc
for the next thirteen years confucius wandered from land to land

followed by his disciples seeking in vain for a ruler that was

willing to employ him and whom he was willing to serve at times he

was exposed to danger at other times to want but as a rule he was

treated with consideration although his teachings were ignored yet

thirteen years of homeless wandering of hopes deferred and

frustrated must have been hard to bear when he left office confucius

was already fiftythree years old and his life so far seemed a

failure the sense of his wasted powers may well have tempted him now

and again to take office under an unworthy ruler but knowing that no

good could come of it he refrained and probably he never seriously

thought of doing so
in  bc when confucius was sixtysix years old through the

influence of his disciple jan yu who was in the service of the chi

the master was invited to return to his native land here hexii remained

till his death in  bc he had many interviews with the reigning

duke and the head of the chi clan but gained no influence over either

of them so he turned once more to his favourite studies edited the

book of poetryperhaps the most interesting collection of ancient

songs extantand wrote spring and autumn his closing years were

darkened by the loss of those dearest to him first his son died then

yen yan the disciple whom he loved best at his death the master was

overcome by grief and he left none behind him that loved learning

lastly tzulu the frank and bold was killed in battle a little

later in his seventyfirst year confucius himself passed away 

bc
this book of the masters sayings is believed by the chinese to have

been written by the disciples of confucius but there is nothing to

prove this and some passages in the book point the other way book

  viii speaks of the death of tsengtzu who did not die till  bc

fortytwo years after the master the chief authority for the text as

it stands today is a manuscript found in the house of confucius in

 bc hidden there in all likelihood between the years  and

 bc when the reigning emperor was seeking to destroy every copy

of the classics we find no earlier reference to the book under its

present name but mencius  bc quotes seven passages from

it in language all but identical with the present text as the words

of confucius no man ever talked the language of these sayings such

pith and smoothness is only reached by a longxiii process of rounding and

polishing we shall probably come no nearer to the truth than legges

conclusion that the book was put together by the pupils of the

disciples of confucius from the words and notebooks of their masters

about the year  bc

wishes so they both retired into obscurity when king wu overthrew

the tyrant chou  bc they starved to death rather than live

under a new dynasty of poyi mencius tells us book x chapter 

his eyes would not look on an evil face his ears would not listen to

an evil sound he served none but his own lord he ruled none but his

own people he came in when there was order and withdrew when tumults

came where lawless rule showed or lawless people stayed he could

not bear to dwell to be together with country folk he thought like

sitting in court dress and court cap on dust and ashes in chous time

he dwelt by the north sea shore waiting for all below heaven to grow

clean so hearing the ways of poyi the fool grows honest and the

weaklings purpose stands

book x
 among his own country folk confucius wore a homely look like one

that has no word to say
in the ancestral temple and at court his speech was full but

cautious
 at court he talked frankly to men of low rank winningly to men of

high rank when the king was there he looked intent and solemn
 when the king bade him receive guests his face seemed to change

and his legs to bend he bowed left and right to those beside him

straightened his robes in front and behind and swept forward with

arms spread like wings when the guest had left he brought back word

saying the guest is no longer looking
 as he went in at the palace gate he stooped as though it were too

low for him he did not stand in the middle of the gate or step on

the threshold
when he passed the throne his face seemed to change and his legs to

bend he spake with bated breath as he went up the hall to audience

he lifted his robes bowed his back and masked his breathing till it

seemed to stop as he came down he relaxed his face below the first

step and looked pleased from the foot of the steps he swept forward

with arms spread like wings and when he was back in his seat he

looked intent as before
 when he carried the sceptre his back bent as under too heavy a

burden he lifted it no higher than in bowing and no lower than in

making a gift his face changed as it will with fear and he dragged

his feet as though they were fettered
when he offered his present his manner was formal but at the private

audience he was cheerful
 the gentleman was never decked in violet or mauve even at home he

would not wear red or purple
in hot weather he wore an unlined linen gown but always over other

clothes
with lambskin he wore black with fawn white and with foxskin

yellow at home he wore a long fur gown with the right sleeve short
his nightgown was always half as long again as his body
in the house he wore thick fur of fox or badger
when he was not in mourning there was nothing missing from his girdle
except for sacrificial dress he was sparing of stuff
he did not wear lambs fur or a black cap on a mourning visit
at the new moon he always put on court dress and went to court
 on his days of abstinence he always wore linen clothes of a pale

colour and he changed his food and moved from his wonted seat
 he did not dislike wellcleaned rice or hash chopped small he did

not eat sour or mouldy rice bad fish or tainted flesh he did not

eat anything that had a bad colour or that smelt bad or food that

was badly cooked or out of season food that was badly cut or served

with the wrong sauce he did not eat however much flesh there might

be it could not conquer his taste for rice to wine alone he set no

limit but he did not drink enough to muddle him he did not drink

bought wine or eat readydried market meat he never went without

ginger at a meal he did not eat much
after a sacrifice at the palace he did not keep the flesh overnight

he never kept sacrificial flesh more than three days if it had been

kept longer it was not eaten
he did not talk at meals nor speak when he was in bed
even at a meal of coarse rice or herb broth or gourds he made his

offering with all reverence
 if his mat was not straight he would not sit down
 when the villagers were drinking wine as those that walked with a

staff left he left too
at the village exorcisms he put on court dress and stood on the east

steps
 when sending a man with enquiries to another land he bowed twice

to him and saw him out
when kang gave him some drugs he bowed accepted them and said i

have never taken them i dare not taste them
 on coming back from court after his stables had been burnt the

master said is anyone hurt he did not ask about the horses
 when the king sent him cooked meat he put his mat straight and

tasted it first when he sent him raw flesh he had it cooked and

offered it to the spirits when he sent him a live beast he kept it

alive
when he ate in attendance on the king the king made the offering he

tasted things first
when he was sick and the king came to see him he lay with his head to

the east with his court dress over him and his girdle across it
when he was called by the kings bidding he walked without waiting

for his carriage
 on going into the great temple he asked about everything
 when a friend died who had no home to go to he said it is for

me to bury him
when friends sent him anything even a carriage and horses he never

bowed unless the gift was sacrificial flesh
 he did not sleep like a corpse at home he unbent
even if he knew him well his face changed when he saw a mourner even

when he was in undress if he saw anyone in full dress or a blind

man he looked grave
to men in deep mourning and to the censusbearers he bowed over the

crossbar
before choice meats he rose with changed look at sharp thunder or a

fierce wind his look changed
 when mounting his carriage he stood straight and grasped the cord

when he was in it he did not look round or speak fast or point
 seeing a mans face she rose flew round and settled the master

said hen pheasant on the ridge it is the season it is the season
tzulu went towards her she sniffed thrice and rose

as they sat beside him i may be a day older than you but forget

that ye are wont to say i am unknown well if ye were known what

would ye do
tzulu answered lightly give me a land of a thousand chariots

crushed between great neighbours overrun by soldiers and searched by

famine and within three years i could put courage into it and high

purpose
the master smiled
what wouldst thou do chiu he said
he answered give me a land of sixty or seventy or fifty or sixty

square miles and within three years i could give the people plenty

as for courtesy and music they would wait the coming of a gentleman
and what wouldst thou do chih
he answered i do not speak of what i can do but of what i should

like to learn at services in the ancestral temple or at the grand

audience i should like to fill a small part
and what wouldst thou do tien
tien stopped playing pushed his still sounding lute aside rose and

answered my choice would be unlike those of the other three
what harm in that said the master each but spake his mind
in the last days of spring all clad for the springtime with five or

six young men and six or seven lads i would bathe in the yi be

fanned by the wind in the rain gods glade and go back home singing
the master said with a sigh i side with tien
tseng hsi stayed after the other three had left and said what did ye

think sir of what the three disciples said
each but spake his mind said the master
why did ye smile at yu sir
lands are swayed by courtesy but what he said was not modest that

was why i smiled yet did not chiu speak of a state where would

sixty or seventy or fifty or sixty square miles be found that are

not a state and did not chih too speak of a state who but great

vassals are there in the ancestral temple or at the grand audience

but if chih were to take a small part who could fill a big one

 tzulu probably said to him on the occasion mentioned

in  i
 another of these seigneurs du temps jadis that is

more to us than a dim shadow for he still lives in the pages of

mencius who tells us that he was not ashamed of a foul lord and did

not refuse a small post on coming in he did not hide his worth but

held his own way neglected and idle he did not grumble straitened

and poor he did not mope when brought together with country folk he

was quite at his ease and could not bear to leave them thou art thou

he said and i am i standing beside me with thy coat off or thy body

naked how canst thou defile me book x chapter  he stopped if a

hand was raised to stop him for he did not care whether he went or no

 the chi was about to make war on chuany
when confucius saw jan yu and chilu they said to him the chi

is going to deal with chuany
confucius said after all chiu art thou not in the wrong the

kings of old made chuany lord of tung meng moreover as

chuany is inside our borders it is the liege of the spirits of earth

and corn of our land so how can ye make war upon it
jan yu said our master wishes it tzulu and i his two ministers do

not either of us wish it
confucius said chiu chou jen used to say he that can put forth

his strength takes his place in the line he that cannot stands back

who would take to help him a man that is no stay in danger and no

support in falling moreover what thou sayest is wrong if a tiger or

a buffalo escapes from his pen if tortoiseshell or jade is broken in

its case who is to blame
jan yu said but chuany is now strong and it is near to pi if

it is not taken now in days to come it will bring sorrow on our sons

and grandsons
chiu said confucius instead of saying i want it a gentleman

hates to plead that he needs must i have heard that fewness of men

does not vex a king or a chief but unlikeness of lot vexes him

poverty does not vex him but want of peace vexes him for if wealth

were even no one would be poor in harmony is number peace prevents

a fall thus if far off tribes will not submit bring them in by

encouraging mind and art and when they come in give them peace but

now when far off tribes will not submit ye two helpers of your

lord cannot bring them in the kingdom is split and falling and ye

cannot save it yet inside our land ye plot to move spear and shield

the sorrows of chis grandsons will not rise in chuany i fear they

will rise within the palace wall
 confucius said when the way is kept below heaven courtesy music

and punitive wars flow from the son of heaven when the way is lost

below heaven courtesy music and punitive wars flow from the great

vassals when they flow from the great vassals they will rarely last

for ten generations when they flow from the great ministers they will

rarely last for five generations when underlings sway the countrys

fate they will rarely last for three generations when the way is kept

below heaven power does not lie with the great ministers when the way

is kept below heaven common folk do not argue
 confucius said for five generations its income has passed from the

ducal house for four generations power has lain with the great

ministers and humbled therefore are the sons and grandsons of the

three huan
 confucius said there are three friends that help us and three

that do us harm the friends that help us are a straight friend an

outspoken friend and a friend that has heard much the friends that

harm us are plausible friends friends that like to flatter and

friends with a glib tongue
 confucius said there are three delights that do good and three

that do us harm those that do good are delight in dissecting good

form and music delight in speaking of the good in men and delight in

having many worthy friends those that do harm are proud delights

delight in idle roving and delight in the joys of the feast
 confucius said men that wait upon lords fall into three mistakes

to speak before the time has come is rashness not to speak when the

time has come is secrecy to speak heedless of looks is blindness
 confucius said a gentleman has three things to guard against
in the days of thy youth ere thy strength is steady beware of lust

when manhood is reached in the fulness of strength beware of strife

in old age when thy strength is broken beware of greed
 confucius said a gentleman holds three things in awe he is in

awe of the bidding of heaven he is in awe of great men and he is

awed by the words of the holy
the small man knows not the bidding of heaven and holds it not in

awe he is saucy towards the great he makes game of holy mens words
 confucius said the best men are born wise next come those that

grow wise by learning then those that learn from toil those that do

not learn from toil are the lowest of the people
 confucius said a gentleman has nine aims to see clearly to

understand what he hears to be warm in manner dignified in bearing

faithful of speech keen at work to ask when in doubt in anger to

think of difficulties and in sight of gain to think of right
 confucius said in sight of good to be filled with longing to

look on evil as scalding to the touch i have seen such men i have

heard such words
to live apart and search thy will to achieve thy way by doing right

i have heard these words but i have seen no such men
 ching duke of chi had a thousand teams of horses but the

people on his death day found no good in him to praise poyi

and shuchi starved at the foot of shouyang and to this day

the people still praise them
is not this the clue to that
 chen kang asked poy apart from us have ye heard

anything sir
he answered no once as my father stood alone and i sped across the

hall he said to me art thou learning poetry i answered no he that

does not learn poetry he said has no hold on words i withdrew and

learned poetry
another day when he again stood alone and i sped across the hall he

said to me art thou learning courtesy i answered no he that does

not learn courtesy he said has no foothold i withdrew and learned

courtesy these two things i have heard
chen kang withdrew and cried gladly i asked one thing and i get

three i hear of poetry i hear of courtesy and i hear too that a

gentleman stands aloof from his son
 a king speaks of his wife as my wife she calls herself

handmaid her subjects speak of her as our lords wife but when

they speak to foreigners they say our little queen foreigners

speak of her too as the lords wife

him he sent confucius a sucking pig confucius chose a time when he

was out and went to thank him they met on the road

 the master said men are near to each other by nature the lives

they lead sunder them
 the master said only the wisest and stupidest of men never change
 as the master came to wucheng he heard sounds of lute and

song
why use an oxknife to kill a fowl said the master with a pleased

smile
tzuyu answered master once i heard you say a gentleman that has

learnt the way loves men small folk that have learnt the way are easy

to rule
my twothree boys said the master what yen says is true i

spake before in play
 kungshan fujao held pi in rebellion he called the master

who wished to go
tzulu said in displeasure this cannot be why must ye go to

kungshan
the master said he calls me and would that be all could i not make

an eastern chou of him that uses me
 tzuchang asked confucius what is love
confucius said love is to mete out five things to all below heaven
may i ask what they are
modesty and bounty said confucius truth earnestness and kindness

modesty escapes insult bounty wins the many truth gains mens trust

earnestness brings success and kindness is enough to make men work
 pi hsi called the master who wished to go
tzulu said master i heard you say once to men whose own life is

evil no gentleman will go pi hsi holds chungmou in rebellion how

could ye go to him sir
yes i said so answered the master but is not a thing called hard

that cannot be ground thin white if steeping will not turn it black

and am i a gourd can i hang without eating
 the master said hast thou heard the six words yu and the

six they sink into
he answered no
sit down and i shall tell thee the thirst for love without love of

learning sinks into simpleness love of knowledge without love of

learning sinks into vanity love of truth without love of learning

sinks into cruelty love of straightness without love of learning

sinks into rudeness love of daring without love of learning sinks

into turbulence love of strength without love of learning sinks

into oddity
 the master said my little children why do ye not learn poetry

poetry would ripen you teach you insight friendliness and

forbearance show you how to serve your father at home and teach your

lord abroad and it would teach you the names of many birds and

beasts plants and trees
 the master said to poy hast thou done the chounan and

shaonan he that has not done the chounan and shaonan is like

a man standing with his face to the wall
 the master said courtesy courtesy is the cry but are jade

and silk the whole of courtesy music music is the cry but are

bells and drums the whole of music
 the master said fierce looks and weakness within are like the

small man like the thief that breaks through or clambers over a wall
 the master said the plain townsman is the bane of mind
 the master said to tell unto the dust all that we hear upon the

way is to lay waste the mind
 the master said how can we serve the king with a low fellow who

is itching to get what he wants and trembling to lose what he has

this trembling to lose what he has may lead him anywhere
 the master said men of old had three failings which have

perhaps died out today ambitious men of old were not nice now they

are unprincipled stern men of old were hard now they are

quarrelsome ignorant men of old were straight now they are false

that is all
 the master said smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found

with love
 the master said i hate the ousting of scarlet by purple i hate

the strains of cheng confounders of sweet music i hate a sharp

tongue the ruin of kingdom and home
 the master said i wish no word were spoken
tzukung said sir if ye said no word what could your little

children write
the master said what are the words of heaven the four seasons pass

the hundred things bear life what are the words of heaven
 ju pei wished to see confucius confucius pleaded sickness but

as the messenger left his door he took a lute and sang so the

messenger should hear
 tsai wo asked about mourning for three years he thought that

one was enough
if for three years gentlemen forsake courtesy courtesy must suffer

if for three years they forsake music music must decay the old grain

passes the new grain sprouts the round of woods for the firedrill

is ended in one year
the master said feeding on rice clad in brocade couldst thou be at

rest
i could he answered
then do what gives thee rest but a gentleman when he is mourning

has no taste for sweets and no ear for music he cannot rest in his

home so he gives these up now they give thee rest then keep them
after tsai wo had gone the master said ys want of love at

the age of three a child first leaves the arms of his father and

mother and mourning lasts for three years everywhere below heaven

but did y have for three years the love of his father and mother
 the master said it is hard indeed when a man eats his fill all

day and has nothing to task the mind could he not play at chequers

even that were better
 tzulu said do gentlemen honour daring
they put right higher said the master with daring and no sense of

right gentlemen turn rebels and small men turn robbers
 tzukung said do gentlemen hate too
they do said the master they hate the sounding of evil deeds they

hate men of low estate that slander those over them they hate daring

without courtesy they hate men that are stout and fearless but

blind
and tzu he said dost thou hate too
i hate those that take spying for wisdom who take want of manners for

courage and take taletelling for honesty
 the master said only maids and servinglads are hard to train if

we draw near to them they get unruly if we hold them off they grow

spiteful
 the master said when a man of forty is hated he will be so to

the end

tzulu stood and bowed
he kept tzulu for the night killed a fowl made millet gave them

him to eat and presented his two sons
tzulu left the next day and told the master
the master said he is in hiding
he sent tzulu back to see him but when he arrived he had gone
tzulu said not to take office is not right if the ties of old and

young cannot be thrown off how can he throw off the lieges duty to

his lord he wishes to keep his life clean but he is unsettling the

bonds between men to discharge that duty a gentleman takes office

though he knows beforehand that the way will not be kept
 poyi shuchi ychung yiyi chuchang liuhsia hui and

shaolien were men that hid from the world
the master said poyi and shuchi did not bend the will or

shame the body
we must say that liuhsia hui and shaolien bent the will and

shamed the body their words hit mans duty their deeds hit our

hopes this we can say and no more
we may say that ychung and yiyi lived hidden but were free of

speech their lives were clean their retreat was well weighed

 tzuchang said the knight that stakes his life when he sees

danger who in sight of gain thinks of right and whose thoughts are

reverent at worship and sad when he is in mourning will do
 tzuhsia said goodness clutched too narrowly a belief in the way

which is not honest can they be said to be or said not to be
 the disciples of tzuhsia asked tzuchang whom we should choose as

our companions
tzuchang said what does tzuhsia say
they answered tzuhsia says if the men be well for thee go with

them if they be not well push them off
tzuchang said this is not the same as what i had heard a gentleman

honours worth and bears with the many he applauds goodness and pities

weakness if i were a man of great worth what could i not bear with

in others if i am without worth men will push me off why should i

push other men off
 tzuhsia said though there must be things worth seeing along small

ways a gentleman does not follow them for fear of being left at last

in the mire
 tzuhsia said he that each day remembers his failings and each

month forgets nothing won may be said to love learning indeed
 tzuhsia said by wide learning and singleness of will by keen

questions and home thinking we reach love
 tzuhsia said to master the hundred trades apprentices work in a

shop by learning a gentleman finds his way
 tzuhsia said the small man must always gloss his faults
 tzuhsia said a gentleman changes thrice looking up to him he

seems stern as we draw near he warms but his speech when we hear

it is sharp
 tzuhsia said until they trust him a gentleman lays no burdens

on his people if they do not trust him they will think it cruel

until they trust him he does not chide them unless they trust him

it will seem faultfinding
 tzuhsia said if we keep within the bounds of honour we can step

to and fro through propriety
 tzuyu said the disciples the little sons of tzuhsia can

sprinkle and sweep attend and answer come in and go out but what

can come of twigs without roots
when tzuhsia heard this he said yen yu is wrong if we teach

one thing in the way of a gentleman first shall we tire before

reaching the next thus plants and trees differ in size should the

way of a gentleman bewilder him to learn it first and last none but

the holy are fit
 tzuhsia said a servant of the crown should give his spare

strength to learning with his spare strength a scholar should serve

the crown
 tzuyu said mourning should stretch to grief and stop there
 tzuyu said our friend chang can do hard things but love is

not yet his
 tsengtzu said chang is so spacious so lordly that at his side

it is hard to do what love bids
 tsengtzu said i have heard the master say man never shows what

is in him unless it be in mourning those dear to him
 tsengtzu said i have heard the master say in all else we may be

as good a son as meng chuang but in not changing his fathers

ministers or his fathers rule he is hard to match
 the meng made yang fu chief knight who spake to

tsengtzu about it
tsengtzu said those above have lost their way the people have long

been astray when thou dost get at the truth be moved to pity not

puffed with joy
 tzukung said chou was not so very wicked thus a gentleman

hates to live in a hollow down into which runs all that is foul below

heaven
 tzukung said a gentlemans faults are like the eating of sun or

moon all men see them and when he mends all men look up to him
 kungsun chao of wei asked tzukung from whom did chungni

learn
tzukung said the way of wen and wu has not fallen into ruin it

lives in men the big in big men the small in small men in none of

them is the way of wen and wu missing how should the master not learn

it what need had he for a set teacher
 in talk with the great men of the court shusun wushu said

tzukung is worthier than chungni
tzufu chingpo told this to tzukung
tzukung said this is like the palace wall my wall reaches to the

shoulder peeping over you see the good home within the masters wall

is several fathoms high no one can see the beauty of the ancestral

temple and the wealth of its hundred officers unless he gets in by

the gate and if only a few men find the gate may not my lord have

spoken the truth
 shusun wushu cried down chungni
tzukung said it is labour lost chungni cannot be cried down the

greatness of other men is a hummock over which we can still leap

chungni is the sun or moon which no one can overleap though the man

were willing to kill himself how could he hurt the sun or moon that

he does not know his own measure would only be seen the better
 chen tzuchin said to tzukung ye humble yourself sir in

what is chungni your better
tzukung said by one word a gentleman shows wisdom by one word want

of wisdom words must not be lightly spoken no one can come up to the

master as heaven is not to be climbed by steps if the master had

power in a kingdom or a clan the saying would come true what he

sets up stands he shows the way and men go it he brings peace and

they come he stirs them and they are at one honoured in life he is

mourned when dead who can come up to him

 yao said hail to thee shun the count that heaven is telling

falls on thee keep true hold of the centre if there be stress or

want within the four seas the gift of heaven will pass for ever
shun laid the same commands on y
tang said i thy little child li dare to offer this black steer

and dare to proclaim before thee almighty lord that i dare not

forgive sin nor keep down thy ministers search them o lord in

thine heart if our life be sinful visit it not upon the ten thousand

homesteads if the ten thousand homesteads sin the sin is on our

head
chou bestowed great gifts and good men grew rich
loving hearts are better than near kinsmen all the people blame no

one but me
he saw to weights and measures revised the laws and brought back

broken officers order reigned everywhere he revived ruined kingdoms

and restored fiefs that had fallen in all hearts below heaven turned

to him the peoples food burials and worship weighed most with him

his bounty gained the many his truth won the peoples trust his

earnestness brought success his justice made men glad
 tzuchang asked confucius how should men be governed
the master said to govern men we must honour five fair things and

spurn four evil things
tzuchang said what are the five fair things
the master said a gentleman is kind but not wasteful he burdens

but he does not embitter he is covetous but not greedy highminded

but not proud stern but not fierce
tzuchang said what is meant by kindness without waste
the master said to further what furthers the people is not that

kindness without waste if burdens be sorted to strength who will

grumble to covet love and get love is that greed few or many small

or great all is one to a gentleman he dares not slight any man is

not this to be highminded but not proud a gentleman straightens his

robe and cap and settles his look he is severe and men look up to

him with awe is not this to be stern but not fierce
tzuchang said what are the four evil things
the master said to leave untaught and then kill is cruelty not to

give warning and to expect things to be done is tyranny to give

careless orders and be strict when the day comes is robbery to be

stingy in rewarding men is littleness
 the master said he that does not know the bidding cannot be a

gentleman not to know good form is to have no foothold not to know

words is to know nothing of men

book i  hsio r
        chapter i  the master said is it not pleasant to learn with

a constant perseverance and application

         is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant

quarters

         is he not a man of complete virtue who feels no

discomposure though men may take no note of him
        chap ii  the philosopher yu said they are few who being

filial and fraternal are fond of offending against their superiors

there have been none who not liking to offend against their

superiors have been fond of stirring up confusion

         the superior man bends his attention to what is radical
that being established all practical courses naturally grow up filial

piety and fraternal submission are they not the root of all

benevolent actions

        chap iii the master said fine words and an insinuating

appearance are seldom associated with true virtue

        chap iv the philosopher tsang said i daily examine myself

on three points whether in transacting business for others i may

have been not faithful whether in intercourse with friends i

may have been not sincere whether i may have not mastered

and practised the instructions of my teacher
        chap v the master said to rule a country of a thousand

chariots there must be reverent attention to business and

sincerity economy in expenditure and love for men and the

employment of the people at the proper seasons

        chap vi the master said a youth when at home should be

filial and abroad respectful to his elders he should be earnest and

truthful he should overflow in love to all and cultivate the

friendship of the good when he has time and opportunity after the

performance of these things he should employ them in polite

studies

        chap vii tszehsia said if a man withdraws his mind from

the love of beauty and applies it as sincerely to the love of the

virtuous if in serving his parents he can exert his utmost strength
if in serving his prince he can devote his life if in his intercourse

with his friends his words are sincere although men say that he

has not learned i will certainly say that he has

        chap viii  the master said if the scholar be not grave he

will not call forth any veneration and his learning will not be solid

         hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles

         have no friends not equal to yourself

         when you have faults do not fear to abandon them

        chap ix the philosopher tsang said let there be a careful

attention to perform the funeral rites to parents and let them be

followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice then

the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence
chap x  tszechin asked tszekung saying when our master

comes to any country he does not fail to learn all about its

government does he ask his information or is it given to him

         tszekung said our master is benign upright courteous

temperate and complaisant and thus he gets his information the

masters mode of asking information is it not different from that

of other men

        chap xi the master said while a mans father is alive look

at the bent of his will when his father is dead look at his conduct

if for three years he does not alter from the way of his father he

may be called filial
chap xii  the philosopher yu said in practising the rules of

propriety a natural ease is to be prized in the ways prescribed by

the ancient kings this is the excellent quality and in things small

and great we follow them

         yet it is not to be observed in all cases if one knowing

how such ease should be prized manifests it without regulating it

by the rules of propriety this likewise is not to be done

        chap xiii the philosopher yu said when agreements are

made according to what is right what is spoken can be made good

when respect is shown according to what is proper one keeps far

from shame and disgrace when the parties upon whom a man

leans are proper persons to be intimate with he can make them his

guides and masters

        chap xiv the master said he who aims to be a man of

complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite nor
in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease he is

earnest in what he is doing and careful in his speech he frequents

the company of men of principle that he may be rectified such a

person may be said indeed to love to learn

        chap xv  tszekung said what do you pronounce

concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter and the rich man

who is not proud the master replied they will do but they are

not equal to him who though poor is yet cheerful and to him who

though rich loves the rules of propriety

         tszekung replied it is said in the book of poetry as you

cut and then file as you carve and then polish the meaning is

the same i apprehend as that which you have just expressed

         the master said with one like tsze i can begin to talk
about the odes i told him one point and he knew its proper

sequence

        chap xvi the master said i will not be afflicted at mens

not knowing me i will be afflicted that i do not know men
book ii wei chang
        chap i the master said he who exercises government by

means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star which

keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it

        chap ii the master said in the book of poetry are three

hundred pieces but the design of them all may be embraced in one

sentence having no depraved thoughts

        chap iii  the master said if the people be led by laws

master said to give ones self earnestly to the duties due to men

and while respecting spiritual beings to keep aloof from them may

be called wisdom he asked about perfect virtue the master said

the man of virtue makes the difficulty to be overcome his first

business and success only a subsequent consideration this may

be called perfect virtue
        chap xxi the master said the wise find pleasure in water

the virtuous find pleasure in hills the wise are active the virtuous

corners a strange cornered vessel a strange cornered vessel

        chap xxiv tsai wo asked saying a benevolent man

though it be told him there is a man in the well will go in after

him i suppose confucius said why should he do so a superior
man may be made to go to the well but he cannot be made to go

down into it he may be imposed upon but he cannot be fooled

        chap xxv the master said the superior man extensively

studying all learning and keeping himself under the restraint of

right

according to the constant mean rare for a long time has been its

practise among the people

        chap xxviii  tszekung said suppose the case of a man

extensively conferring benefits on the people and able to assist all

what would you say of him might he be called perfectly virtuous

the master said why speak only of virtue in connexion with him

must he not have the qualities of a sage even yao and shun were

still solicitous about this

         now the man of perfect virtue wishing to be established

himself seeks also to establish others wishing to be enlarged

himself he seeks also to enlarge others

         to be able to judge of others by what is nigh in ourselves

this may be called the art of virtue

office to undertake its duties when not so called to lie retired it

is only i and you who have attained to this

great state whom would you have to act with you

         the master said i would not have him to act with me who

will unarmed attack a tiger or cross a river without a boat dying

without any regret my associate must be the man who proceeds to

action full of solicitude who is fond of adjusting his plans and then

carries them into execution

poi and shuchi they were ancient worthies said the master

did they have any repinings because of their course the master

again replied they sought to act virtuously and they did so what

was there for them to repine about on this tszekung went out

and said our master is not for him

water to drink and my bended arm for a pillow i have still joy in

the midst of these things riches and honours acquired by

propriety on all these he frequently discoursed
        chap xviii  the duke of sheh asked tszelu about

confucius and tszelu did not answer him

         the master said why did you not say to him he is

simply a man who in his eager pursuit of knowledge forgets his

food who in the joy of its attainment forgets his sorrows and who

does not perceive that old age is coming on

        chap xix the master said i am not one who was born in

nothing which i do that is not shown to you my disciples that is

my way

taught letters ethics devotion of soul and truthfulness
        chap xxv  the master said a sage it is not mine to see

could i see a man of real talent and virtue that would satisfy me

         the master said a good man it is not mine to see could i

see a man possessed of constancy that would satisfy me

         having not and yet affecting to have empty and yet

affecting to be full straitened and yet affecting to be at ease it is

difficult with such characteristics to have constancy

        chap xxvi the master angled but did not use a net he

shot but not at birds perching

        chap xxvii the master said there may be those who act

without knowing why i do not do so hearing much and selecting

what is good and following it seeing much and keeping it in

memory this is the second style of knowledge
        chap xxviii  it was difficult to talk profitably and

reputably with the people of huhsiang and a lad of that place

having had an interview with the master the disciples doubted

         the master said i admit peoples approach to me without

committing myself as to what they may do when they have retired

why must one be so severe if a man purify himself to wait upon

me i receive him so purified without guaranteeing his past

conduct

        chap xxix the master said is virtue a thing remote i wish

to be virtuous and lo virtue is at hand

        chap xxx  the minister of crime of chan asked whether

the duke chao knew propriety and confucius said he knew

propriety

         confucius having retired the minister bowed to wuma chi
to come forward and said i have heard that the superior man is

not a partisan may the superior man be a partisan also the prince

married a daughter of the house of wu of the same surname with

himself and called her the elder tsze of wu if the prince

knew propriety who does not know it

         wuma chi reported these remarks and the master said i

am fortunate if i have any errors people are sure to know them

        chap xxxi when the master was in company with a person

who was singing if he sang well he would make him repeat the

song while he accompanied it with his own voice

        chap xxxii the master said in letters i am perhaps equal

to other men but the character of the superior man carrying out in

his conduct what he professes is what i have not yet attained to
        chap xxxiii the master said the sage and the man of

perfect virtue how dare i rank myself with them it may simply

be said of me that i strive to become such without satiety and

teach others without weariness kunghsi hwa said this is just

what we the disciples cannot imitate you in

        chap xxxiv the master being very sick tszelu asked leave

        chap i the master said taipo may be said to have

reached the highest point of virtuous action thrice he declined the

kingdom and the people in ignorance of his motives could not

express their approbation of his conduct
        chap ii  the master said respectfulness without the

rules of propriety becomes laborious bustle carefulness without

the rules of propriety becomes timidity boldness without the rules

of propriety becomes insubordination straightforwardness

without the rules of propriety becomes rudeness

         when those who are in high stations perform well all their

duties to their relations the people are aroused to virtue when old

friends are not neglected by them the people are preserved from

meanness

        chap iii the philosopher tsang being ill he called to him

the disciples of his school and said uncover my feet uncover my

hands it is said in the book of poetry we should be apprehensive

and cautious as if on the brink of a deep gulf as if treading on thin

ice and so have i been now and hereafter i know my escape

from all injury to my person o ye my little children
        chap iv  the philosopher tsang being ill meng chang

went to ask how he was

         tsang said to him when a bird is about to die its notes are

mournful when a man is about to die his words are good

         there are three principles of conduct which the man of

high rank should consider specially important that in his

deportment and manner he keep from violence and heedlessness

that in regulating his countenance he keep near to sincerity and

that in his words and tones he keep far from lowness and

impropriety as to such matters as attending to the sacrificial

vessels there are the proper officers for them
        chap v the philosopher tsang said gifted with ability and

yet putting questions to those who were not so possessed of much

and yet putting questions to those possessed of little having as

though he had not full and yet counting himself as empty

offended against and yet entering into no altercation formerly i

had a friend who pursued this style of conduct

        chap vi the philosopher tsang said suppose that there is

an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a young

orphan prince and can be commissioned with authority over a state

of a hundred li and whom no emergency however great can drive

from his principles is such a man a superior man he is a

superior man indeed

        chap vii  the philosopher tsang said the officer may not

be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance his burden is

heavy and his course is long
         perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is his to

sustain is it not heavy only with death does his course stop is

it not long

        chap viii  the master said it is by the odes that the

mind is aroused

         it is by the rules of propriety that the character is

established

         it is from music that the finish is received

        chap ix the master said the people may be made to follow

a path of action but they may not be made to understand it

        chap x the master said the man who is fond of daring and

the man who is not virtuous when you carry your dislike of him to

an extreme
        chap xi the master said though a man have abilities as

admirable as those of the duke of chau yet if he be proud and

niggardly those other things are really not worth being looked at

        chap xii the master said it is not easy to find a man who

has learned for three years without coming to be good

        chap xiii  the master said with sincere faith he unites

the love of learning holding firm to death he is perfecting the

excellence of his course

         such an one will not enter a tottering state nor dwell in a

disorganized one when right principles of government prevail in

the kingdom he will show himself when they are prostrated he

will keep concealed

         when a country is wellgoverned poverty and a mean

condition are things to be ashamed of when a country is ill

governed riches and honour are things to be ashamed of
        chap xiv the master said he who is not in any particular

office has nothing to do with plans for the administration of its

duties

        chap xv the master said when the music master chih first

entered on his office the finish of the kwan tsu was magnificent

how it filled the ears

        chap xvi the master said ardent and yet not upright

stupid and yet not attentive simple and yet not sincere such

persons i do not understand

        chap xvii the master said learn as if you could not reach

your object and were always fearing also lest you should lose it

        chap xviii the master said how majestic was the manner

in which shun and yu held possession of the empire as if it were

nothing to them
        chap xix  the master said great indeed was yao as a

sovereign how majestic was he it is only heaven that is grand

and only yao corresponded to it how vast was his virtue the

people could find no name for it

         how majestic was he in the works which he accomplished

how glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted

        chap xx  shun had five ministers and the empire was

wellgoverned

         king wu said i have ten able ministers

         confucius said is not the saying that talents are difficult to

find true only when the dynasties of tang and yu met were they

more abundant than in this of chau yet there was a woman among

them the able ministers were no more than nine men
         king wan possessed two of the three parts of the empire

and with those he served the dynasty of yin the virtue of the

house of chau may be said to have reached the highest point

indeed

        chap xxi the master said i can find no flaw in the

character of yu he used himself coarse food and drink but

displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits his ordinary

garments were poor but he displayed the utmost elegance in his

sacrificial cap and apron he lived in a low mean house but

expended all his strength on the ditches and waterchannels i can

find nothing like a flaw in yu
book ix tsze han
        chap i the subjects of which the master seldom spoke

were profitableness and also the appointments of heaven and

perfect virtue

        chap ii  a man of the village of tahsiang said great

indeed is the philosopher kung his learning is extensive and yet

he does not render his name famous by any particular thing

         the master heard the observation and said to his disciples

what shall i practise shall i practise charioteering or shall i

practise archery i will practise charioteering
        chap iii  the master said the linen cap is that prescribed

by the rules of ceremony but now a silk one is worn it is

economical and i follow the common practice

         the rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall

but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it that is

arrogant i continue to bow below the hall though i oppose the

common practice

        chap iv there were four things from which the master was

entirely free he had no foregone conclusions no arbitrary

predeterminations no obstinacy and no egoism

        chap v  the master was put in fear in kwang

         he said after the death of king wan was not the cause of

truth lodged here in me
         if heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish then

i a future mortal should not have got such a relation to that cause

while heaven does not let the cause of truth perish what can the

people of kwang do to me

        chap vi  a high officer asked tszekung saying may we

not say that your master is a sage how various is his ability

         tszekung said certainly heaven has endowed him

unlimitedly he is about a sage and moreover his ability is

various

         the master heard of the conversation and said does the

high officer know me when i was young my condition was low

and therefore i acquired my ability in many things but they were

mean matters must the superior man have such variety of ability

he does not need variety of ability

         lao said the master said having no official employment

i acquired many arts
        chap vii the master said am i indeed possessed of

knowledge i am not knowing but if a mean person who appears

quite emptylike ask anything of me i set it forth from one end to

the other and exhaust it

        chap viii the master said the fang bird does not come

the river sends forth no map it is all over with me

        chap ix when the master saw a person in a mourning dress

or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full

dress or a blind person on observing them approaching though

they were younger than himself he would rise up and if he had to

pass by them he would do so hastily
        chap x  yen yuan in admiration of the masters doctrines

sighed and said i looked up to them and they seemed to become

more high i tried to penetrate them and they seemed to become

more firm i looked at them before me and suddenly they seemed

to be behind

         the master by orderly method skilfully leads men on he

enlarged my mind with learning and taught me the restraints of

propriety

         when i wish to give over the study of his doctrines i

cannot do so and having exerted all my ability there seems

something to stand right up before me but though i wish to follow

and lay hold of it i really find no way to do so

        chap xi  the master being very ill tszelu wished the

disciples to act as ministers to him

         during a remission of his illness he said long has the

conduct of yu been deceitful by pretending to have ministers when

i have them not whom should i impose upon should i impose

upon heaven
         moreover than that i should die in the hands of ministers

is it not better that i should die in the hands of you my disciples

and though i may not get a great burial shall i die upon the road

        chap xii tszekung said there is a beautiful gem here

should i lay it up in a case and keep it or should i seek for a good

price and sell it the master said sell it sell it but i would wait

for one to offer the price

        chap xiii  the master was wishing to go and live among

then the music was reformed and the pieces in the royal songs and

praise songs all found their proper places
        chap xv the master said abroad to serve the high

ministers and nobles at home to serve ones father and elder

brothers in all duties to the dead not to dare not to exert ones self

and not to be overcome of wine which one of these things do i

attain to

        chap xvi the master standing by a stream said it passes

on just like this not ceasing day or night

        chap xvii the master said i have not seen one who loves

virtue as he loves beauty

        chap xviii the master said the prosecution of learning

may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound if there

want but one basket of earth to complete the work and i stop the
stopping is my own work it may be compared to throwing down

the earth on the level ground though but one basketful is thrown

at a time the advancing with it is my own going forward

        chap xix the master said never flagging when i set forth

anything to him ah that is hui

        chap xx the master said of yen yuan alas i saw his

constant advance i never saw him stop in his progress

blade springs but the plant does not go on to flower there are

cases where it flowers but no fruit is subsequently produced

        chap xxii the master said a youth is to be regarded with

respect how do we know that his future will not be equal to our

present if he reach the age of forty or fifty and has not made

himself heard of then indeed he will not be worth being regarded

with respect
        chap xxv the master said can men refuse to assent to the

words of strict admonition but it is reforming the conduct because

of them which is valuable can men refuse to be pleased with words

of gentle advice but it is unfolding their aim which is valuable if a

man be pleased with these words but does not unfold their aim

and assents to those but does not reform his conduct i can really

do nothing with him

        chap xxiv the master said hold faithfulness and sincerity

as first principles have no friends not equal to yourself when you

have faults do not fear to abandon them

        chap xxv the master said the commander of the forces of

a large state may be carried off but the will of even a common man

cannot be taken from him
        chap xxvi  the master said dressed himself in a tattered

robe quilted with hemp yet standing by the side of men dressed in

furs and not ashamed ah it is yu who is equal to this

         he dislikes none he covets nothing what can he do but

what is good

         tszelu kept continually repeating these words of the ode

when the master said those things are by no means sufficient to

constitute perfect excellence

        chap xxvii the master said when the year becomes cold

then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose

their leaves

        chap xxviii the master said the wise are free from

perplexities the virtuous from anxiety and the bold from fear

        chap xxix the master said there are some with whom we

may study in common but we shall find them unable to go along
with us to principles perhaps we may go on with them to

principles but we shall find them unable to get established in those

along with us or if we may get so established along with them we

shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us

        chap xxx  how the flowers of the aspenplum flutter and

turn do i not think of you but your house is distant

it distant

court he spoke minutely on every point but cautiously

        chap ii  when he was waiting at court in speaking with

the great officers of the lower grade he spake freely but in a

straightforward manner in speaking with those of the higher grade

he did so blandly but precisely

         when the ruler was present his manner displayed

respectful uneasiness it was grave but selfpossessed
        chap iii  when the prince called him to employ him in the

reception of a visitor his countenance appeared to change and his

legs to move forward with difficulty

         he inclined himself to the other officers among whom he

stood moving his left or right arm as their position required but

keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind evenly adjusted

         he hastened forward with his arms like the wings of a

bird

         when the guest had retired he would report to the prince

the visitor is not turning round any more

        chap iv  when he entered the palace gate he seemed to

bend his body as if it were not sufficient to admit him

gateway when he passed in or out he did not tread upon the

threshold

         when he was passing the vacant place of the prince his

countenance appeared to change and his legs to bend under him

and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter them

         he ascended the reception hall holding up his robe with

both his hands and his body bent holding in his breath also as if

he dared not breathe

         when he came out from the audience as soon as he had

descended one step he began to relax his countenance and had a

satisfied look when he had got to the bottom of the steps he

advanced rapidly to his place with his arms like wings and on

occupying it his manner still showed respectful uneasiness

        chap v  when he was carrying the scepter of his ruler he

seemed to bend his body as if he were not able to bear its weight

he did not hold it higher than the position of the hands in making
a bow nor lower than their position in giving anything to another

his countenance seemed to change and look apprehensive and he

dragged his feet along as if they were held by something to the

ground

         in presenting the presents with which he was charged he

wore a placid appearance

         at his private audience he looked highly pleased

and presented himself at court

and also to change the place where he commonly sat in the

apartment

cleaned nor to have his minced meat cut quite small

what was discoloured or what was of a bad flavour nor anything

which was illcooked or was not in season

air

         the only present for which he bowed was that of the flesh

of sacrifice

        chap xvi  in bed he did not lie like a corpse at home he

did not put on any formal deportment

         when he saw any one in a mourning dress though it might

matters of ceremonies and music were rustics it is said while the

men of these latter times in ceremonies and music are

accomplished gentlemen

         if i have occasion to use those things i follow the men of

former times

brother to wife

now there is no one who loves to learn as he did

        chap vii  when yen yuan died yen lu begged the

carriage of the master to sell and get an outer shell for his sons

coffin

         the master said every one calls his son his son whether

he has talents or has not talents there was li when he died he

had a coffin but no outer shell i would not walk on foot to get a

shell for him because having followed in the rear of the great

officers it was not proper that i should walk on foot

        chap viii when yen yuan died the master said alas

heaven is destroying me heaven is destroying me
        chap ix  when yen yuan died the master bewailed him

exceedingly and the disciples who were with him said master

your grief is excessive

         is it excessive said he

         if i am not to mourn bitterly for this man for whom

should i mourn

        chap x  when yen yuan died the disciples wished to give

him a great funeral and the master said you may not do so

belongs to you o disciples

know about death

        chap xii  the disciple min was standing by his side

looking bland and precise tszelu looking bold and soldierly zan

yu and tszekung with a free and straightforward manner the

master was pleased

         he said yu there he will not die a natural death

        chap xiii  some parties in lu were going to take down

and rebuild the long treasury

         min tszechien said suppose it were to be repaired after

its old style why must it be altered and made anew

         the master said this man seldom speaks when he does

he is sure to hit the point
        chap xiv  the master said what has the lute of yu to do

in my door

         the other disciples began not to respect tszelu the

master said yu has ascended to the hall though he has not yet

passed into the inner apartments

        chap xv  tszekung asked which of the two shih or

shang was the superior the master said shih goes beyond the due

mean and shang does not come up to it

         then said tszekung the superiority is with shih i

suppose

         the master said to go beyond is as wrong as to fall short

        chap xvi  the head of the chi family was richer than the

duke of chau had been and yet chiu collected his imposts for him

and increased his wealth
         the master said he is no disciple of mine my little



children beat the drum and assail him



        chap xvii  chai is simple



         shan is dull



         shih is specious



         yu is coarse



        chap xviii  the master said there is hui he has nearly



attained to perfect virtue he is often in want



         tsze does not acquiesce in the appointments of heaven



and his goods are increased by him yet his judgments are often



correct



        chap xix tszechang asked what were the characteristics of

the good man the master said he does not tread in the footsteps

of others but moreover he does not enter the chamber of the sage

        chap xx the master said if because a mans discourse

appears solid and sincere we allow him to be a good man is he

really a superior man or is his gravity only in appearance

        chap xxi tszelu asked whether he should immediately

carry into practice what he heard the master said there are your

father and elder brothers to be consulted why should you act on

that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear

zan yu asked the same whether he should immediately carry into

practice what he heard and the master answered immediately

carry into practice what you hear kunghsi hwa said yu asked

whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard

and you said there are your father and elder brothers to be

consulted chiu asked whether he should immediately carry into

practice what he heard and you said carry it immediately into

practice i chih am perplexed and venture to ask you for an

explanation the master said chiu is retiring and slow therefore
i urged him forward yu has more than his own share of energy

therefore i kept him back

        chap xxii the master was put in fear in kwang and yen

yuan fell behind the master on his rejoining him said i thought

you had died hui replied while you were alive how should i

presume to die

        chap xxiii  chi tszezan asked whether chung yu and zan

chiu could be called great ministers

         the master said i thought you would ask about some

extraordinary individuals and you only ask about yu and chiu

         what is called a great minister is one who serves his

prince according to what is right and when he finds he cannot do

so retires
         now as to yu and chiu they may be called ordinary



ministers



         tszezan said then they will always follow their chief



will they



         the master said in an act of parricide or regicide they



would not follow him



        chap xxiv  tszelu got tszekao appointed governor of pi



         the master said you are injuring a mans son



         tszelu said there are there common people and officers



there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain why must



one read books before he can be considered to have learned



         the master said it is on this account that i hate your



glibtongued people



        chap xxv  tszelu tsang hsi zan yu and kunghsi hwa



were sitting by the master



         he said to them though i am a day or so older than you



do not think of that

         from day to day you are saying we are not known if

some ruler were to know you what would you like to do

         tszelu hastily and lightly replied suppose the case of a

state of ten thousand chariots let it be straitened between other

large states let it be suffering from invading armies and to this let

there be added a famine in corn and in all vegetables if i were

intrusted with the government of it in three years time i could

make the people to be bold and to recognise the rules of righteous

conduct the master smiled at him

         turning to yen yu he said chiu what are your wishes

chiu replied suppose a state of sixty or seventy li square or one

of fifty or sixty and let me have the government of it in three

years time i could make plenty to abound among the people as to

teaching them the principles of propriety and music i must wait

for the rise of a superior man to do that
         what are your wishes chih said the master next to kung

hsi hwa chih replied i do not say that my ability extends to these

things but i should wish to learn them at the services of the

ancestral temple and at the audiences of the princes with the

sovereign i should like dressed in the dark squaremade robe and

the black linen cap to act as a small assistant

         last of all the master asked tsang hsi tien what are your

wishes tien pausing as he was playing on his lute while it was

yet twanging laid the instrument aside and rose my wishes he

said are different from the cherished purposes of these three

gentlemen what harm is there in that said the master do you

also as well as they speak out your wishes tien then said in this

the last month of spring with the dress of the season all complete

along with five or six young men who have assumed the cap and

six or seven boys i would wash in the i enjoy the breeze among

the rain altars and return home singing the master heaved a sigh

and said i give my approval to tien
         the three others having gone out tsang hsi remained

behind and said what do you think of the words of these three

friends the master replied they simply told each one his wishes

         hsi pursued master why did you smile at yu

         he was answered the management of a state demands

the rules of propriety his words were not humble therefore i

smiled at him

         hsi again said but was it not a state which chiu proposed

for himself the reply was yes did you ever see a territory of

sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty which was not a state

         once more hsi inquired and was it not a state which

chih proposed for himself the master again replied yes who but

princes have to do with ancestral temples and with audiences but

the sovereign if chih were to be a small assistant in these

services who could be a great one
book xii yen yuan
        chap i  yen yuan asked about perfect virtue the master

said to subdue ones self and return to propriety is perfect virtue

if a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety

all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him is the practice

of perfect virtue from a man himself or is it from others

         yen yuan said i beg to ask the steps of that process the

master replied look not at what is contrary to propriety listen not

to what is contrary to propriety speak not what is contrary to

propriety make no movement which is contrary to propriety yen

yuan then said though i am deficient in intelligence and vigour i

will make it my business to practise this lesson
        chap ii chungkung asked about perfect virtue the master

said it is when you go abroad to behave to every one as if you

were receiving a great guest to employ the people as if you were

assisting at a great sacrifice not to do to others as you would not

wish done to yourself to have no murmuring against you in the

country and none in the family chungkung said though i am

deficient in intelligence and vigour i will make it my business to

practise this lesson

        chap iii  szema niu asked about perfect virtue

         the master said the man of perfect virtue is cautious and

slow in his speech
         cautious and slow in his speech said niu is this what is

meant by perfect virtue the master said when a man feels the

difficulty of doing can he be other than cautious and slow in

speaking

        chap iv  szema niu asked about the superior man the

master said the superior man has neither anxiety nor fear

         being without anxiety or fear said nui does this

constitute what we call the superior man

         the master said when internal examination discovers

nothing wrong what is there to be anxious about what is there to

fear

        chap v  szema niu full of anxiety said other men all

have their brothers i only have not

         tszehsia said to him there is the following saying which i

have heard
         death and life have their determined appointment riches

and honours depend upon heaven

         let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his

own conduct and let him be respectful to others and observant of

propriety then all within the four seas will be his brothers what

has the superior man to do with being distressed because he has no

brothers

        chap vi tszechang asked what constituted intelligence the

master said he with whom neither slander that gradually soaks

into the mind nor statements that startle like a wound in the flesh

are successful may be called intelligent indeed yea he with whom

neither soaking slander nor startling statements are successful

may be called farseeing
        chap vii  tszekung asked about government the master

said the requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of

food sufficiency of military equipment and the confidence of the

people in their ruler

         tszekung said if it cannot be helped and one of these

must be dispensed with which of the three should be foregone

first the military equipment said the master

         tszekung again asked if it cannot be helped and one of

the remaining two must be dispensed with which of them should

be foregone the master answered part with the food from of

old death has been the lot of all men but if the people have no

faith in their rulers there is no standing for the state

        chap viii  chi tszechang said in a superior man it is

only the substantial qualities which are wanted why should we

seek for ornamental accomplishments
         tszekung said alas your words sir show you to be a

superior man but four horses cannot overtake the tongue

         ornament is as substance substance is as ornament the

hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair is like the hide of a

dog or a goat stripped of its hair

        chap ix  the duke ai inquired of yu zo saying the year

is one of scarcity and the returns for expenditure are not

sufficient what is to be done

         yu zo replied to him why not simply tithe the people

         with two tenths said the duke i find it not enough how

could i do with that system of one tenth

         yu zo answered if the people have plenty their prince will

not be left to want alone if the people are in want their prince

cannot enjoy plenty alone
        chap x  tszechang having asked how virtue was to be

exalted and delusions to be discovered the master said hold

faithfulness and sincerity as first principles and be moving

continually to what is right this is the way to exalt ones virtue

         you love a man and wish him to live you hate him and

wish him to die having wished him to live you also wish him to

die this is a case of delusion

         it may not be on account of her being rich yet you come

to make a difference

        chap xi  the duke ching of chi asked confucius about

government

         confucius replied there is government when the prince is

prince and the minister is minister when the father is father and

the son is son

         good said the duke if indeed the prince be not prince

the minister not minister the father not father and the son not son

although i have my revenue can i enjoy it
        chap xii  the master said ah it is yu who could with

half a word settle litigations

         tszelu never slept over a promise

        chap xiii the master said in hearing litigations i am like

any other body what is necessary however is to cause the people

to have no litigations

        chap xiv tszechang asked about government the master

said the art of governing is to keep its affairs before the mind

without weariness and to practise them with undeviating

consistency

        chap xv the master said by extensively studying all

learning and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of

propriety one may thus likewise not err from what is right
        chap xvi the master said the superior man seeks to

perfect the admirable qualities of men and does not seek to perfect

their bad qualities the mean man does the opposite of this

        chap xvii chi kang asked confucius about government

confucius replied to govern means to rectify if you lead on the

people with correctness who will dare not to be correct

        chap xviii chi kang distressed about the number of

thieves in the state inquired of confucius how to do away with

them confucius said if you sir were not covetous although you

should reward them to do it they would not steal

        chap xix chi kang asked confucius about government

saying what do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of

the principled confucius replied sir in carrying on your

government why should you use killing at all let your evinced

desires be for what is good and the people will be good the

relation
between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and

the grass the grass must bend when the wind blows across it

        chap xx  tszechang asked what must the officer be who

may be said to be distinguished

         the master said what is it you call being distinguished

         tszechang replied it is to be heard of through the state

to be heard of throughout his clan

         the master said that is notoriety not distinction

         now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward

and loves righteousness he examines peoples words and looks at

their countenances he is anxious to humble himself to others such

a man will be distinguished in the country he will be distinguished

in his clan

         as to the man of notoriety he assumes the appearance of
virtue but his actions are opposed to it and he rests in this

character without any doubts about himself such a man will be

heard of in the country he will be heard of in the clan

        chap xxi  fan chih rambling with the master under the

trees about the rain altars said i venture to ask how to exalt

virtue to correct cherished evil and to discover delusions

         the master said truly a good question

         if doing what is to be done be made the first business and

success a secondary consideration is not this the way to exalt

virtue to assail ones own wickedness and not assail that of

others is not this the way to correct cherished evil for a

mornings anger to disregard ones own life and involve that of his

parents is not this a case of delusion

        chap xxii  fan chih asked about benevolence the master

said it is to love all men he asked about knowledge the master

said it is to know all men
         fan chih did not immediately understand these answers

         the master said employ the upright and put aside all the

crooked in this way the crooked can be made to be upright

         fan chih retired and seeing tszehsia he said to him a

little while ago i had an interview with our master and asked him

about knowledge he said employ the upright and put aside all the

crooked in this way the crooked will be made to be upright

what did he mean

         tszehsia said truly rich is his saying

         shun being in possession of the kingdom selected from

among all the people and employed kaoyao on which all who

were devoid of virtue disappeared tang being in possession of the

kingdom selected from among all the people and employed i yin

and all who were devoid of virtue disappeared

        chap xxiii tszekung asked about friendship the master

said faithfully admonish your friend and skillfully lead him on if

you find him impracticable stop do not disgrace yourself
        chap xxiv the philosopher tsang said the superior man

on grounds of culture meets with his friends and by their

friendship helps his virtue
book xiii tszelu
        chap i  tszelu asked about government the master said

go before the people with your example and be laborious in their

affairs

         he requested further instruction and was answered be

not weary in these things

        chap ii  chungkung being chief minister to the head of

the chi family asked about government the master said employ
first the services of your various officers pardon small faults and

raise to office men of virtue and talents

         chungkung said how shall i know the men of virtue and

talent so that i may raise them to office he was answered raise

to office those whom you know as to those whom you do not know

will others neglect them

        chap iii  tszelu said the ruler of wei has been waiting

for you in order with you to administer the government what will

you consider the first thing to be done

         the master replied what is necessary is to rectify names

         so indeed said tszelu you are wide of the mark why

must there be such rectification

         the master said how uncultivated you are yu a superior

man in regard to what he does not know shows a cautious reserve

         if names be not correct language is not in accordance with
the truth of things if language be not in accordance with the truth

of things affairs cannot be carried on to success

         when affairs cannot be carried on to success proprieties

and music will not flourish when proprieties and music do not

flourish punishments will not be properly awarded when

punishments are not properly awarded the people do not know

how to move hand or foot

         therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the

names he uses may be spoken appropriately and also that what he

speaks may be carried out appropriately what the superior man

requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect

        chap iv  fan chih requested to be taught husbandry the

master said i am not so good for that as an old husbandman he
requested also to be taught gardening and was answered i am not

so good for that as an old gardener

         fan chih having gone out the master said a small man

indeed is fan hsu

         if a superior love propriety the people will not dare not to

be reverent if he love righteousness the people will not dare not

to submit to his example if he love good faith the people will not

dare not to be sincere now when these things obtain the people

from all quarters will come to him bearing their children on their

backs what need has he of a knowledge of husbandry

        chap v the master said though a man may be able to

recite the three hundred odes yet if when intrusted with a

governmental charge he knows not how to act or if when sent to

any quarter on a mission he cannot give his replies unassisted

notwithstanding the extent of his learning of what practical use is

it
        chap vi the master said when a princes personal conduct

is correct his government is effective without the issuing of orders

if his personal conduct is not correct he may issue orders but they

will not be followed

        chap vii the master said the governments of lu and wei

are brothers

        chap viii the master said of ching a scion of the ducal

family of wei that he knew the economy of a family well when he

began to have means he said ha here is a collection when they

were a little increased he said ha this is complete when he had

become rich he said ha this is admirable

        chap ix  when the master went to wei zan yu acted as

driver of his carriage

         the master observed how numerous are the people

         yu said since they are thus numerous what more shall be

done for them enrich them was the reply
         and when they have been enriched what more shall be

done the master said teach them

        chap x the master said if there were any of the princes

who would employ me in the course of twelve months i should

have done something considerable in three years the government

would be perfected

        chap xi the master said if good men were to govern a

country in succession for a hundred years they would be able to

transform the violently bad and dispense with capital

punishments true indeed is this saying

        chap xii the master said if a truly royal ruler were to

arise it would still require a generation and then virtue would

prevail
        chap xiii the master said if a minister make his own

conduct correct what difficulty will he have in assisting in

government if he cannot rectify himself what has he to do with

rectifying others

        chap xiv the disciple zan returning from the court the

master said to him how are you so late he replied we had

government business the master said it must have been family

affairs if there had been government business though i am not

now in office i should have been consulted about it

        chap xv  the duke ting asked whether there was a single

sentence which could make a country prosperous confucius replied

such an effect cannot be expected from one sentence

         there is a saying however which people have to be a

prince is difficult to be a minister is not easy

         if a ruler knows this the difficulty of being a prince

may there not be expected from this one sentence the prosperity of

his country

         the duke then said is there a single sentence which can

ruin a country confucius replied such an effect as that cannot be

expected from one sentence there is however the saying which

people have i have no pleasure in being a prince but only in

that no one can offer any opposition to what i say

         if a rulers words be good is it not also good that no one

oppose them but if they are not good and no one opposes them

may there not be expected from this one sentence the ruin of his

country

        chap xvi  the duke of sheh asked about government

         the master said good government obtains when those

who are near are made happy and those who are far off are

attracted
        chap xvii tszehsia being governor of chufu asked about

government the master said do not be desirous to have things

done quickly do not look at small advantages desire to have things

done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly looking at

small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished

        chap xviii  the duke of sheh informed confucius saying

among us here there are those who may be styled upright in their

conduct if their father have stolen a sheep they will bear witness

to the fact

         confucius said among us in our part of the country those

who are upright are different from this the father conceals the

misconduct of the son and the son conceals the misconduct of the

father uprightness is to be found in this
        chap xix fan chih asked about perfect virtue the master

said it is in retirement to be sedately grave in the management

of business to be reverently attentive in intercourse with others

to be strictly sincere though a man go among rude uncultivated

tribes these qualities may not be neglected

        chap xx  tszekung asked saying what qualities must a

man possess to entitle him to be called an officer the master said

he who in his conduct of himself maintains a sense of shame and

when sent to any quarter will not disgrace his princes commission

deserves to be called an officer

         tszekung pursued i venture to ask who may be placed in

the next lower rank and he was told he whom the circle of his

relatives pronounce to be filial whom his fellowvillagers and

neighbours pronounce to be fraternal

         again the disciple asked i venture to ask about the class

still next in order the master said they are determined to be

sincere in what they say and to carry out what they do they are

obstinate little men yet perhaps they may make the next class
         tszekung finally inquired of what sort are those of the

present day who engage in government the master said pooh

they are so many pecks and hampers not worth being taken into

        chap xiv  the master asked kungming chia about kung

shu wan saying is it true that your master speaks not laughs not

and takes not

         kungming chia replied this has arisen from the reporters

going beyond the truth my master speaks when it is the time to

speak and so men do not get tired of his speaking he laughs when

them in his breast

whose evil do i blame whose goodness do i praise beyond what is

for it in my examination of the individual

        chap xxxii  the master said when a mans knowledge is

sufficient to attain and his virtue is not sufficient to enable him to

hold whatever he may have gained he will lose again

         when his knowledge is sufficient to attain and he has

virtue enough to hold fast if he cannot govern with dignity the

people will not respect him

virtue enough to hold fast when he governs also with dignity yet if

he try to move the people contrary to the rules of propriety full

excellence is not reached
        chap xxxiii the master said the superior man cannot be

known in little matters but he may be intrusted with great

concerns the small man may not be intrusted with great concerns

but he may be known in little matters

        chap xxxiv the master said virtue is more to man than

him saying so and so is here so and so is here

         the musicmaster mien having gone out tszechang

asked saying is it the rule to tell those things to the music

master

         the master said yes this is certainly the rule for those

who lead the blind
book xvi ke she
        chap i  the head of the chi family was going to attack

chwanyu

         zan yu and chilu had an interview with confucius and

said our chief chi is going to commence operations against

chwanyu

         confucius said chiu is it not you who are in fault here

         now in regard to chwanyu long ago a former king

appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern

mang moreover it is in the midst of the territory of our state and

its ruler is a minister in direct connexion with the sovereign

what has your chief to do with attacking it

         zan yu said our master wishes the thing neither of us two

ministers wishes it

         confucius said chiu there are the words of chau zan

when he can put forth his ability he takes his place in the ranks of

office when he finds himself unable to do so he retires from it

how can he be used as a guide to a blind man who does not

support him when tottering nor raise him up when fallen

         and further you speak wrongly when a tiger or

rhinoceros escapes from his cage when a tortoise or piece of jade is

injured in its repository whose is the fault

         zan yu said but at present chwanyu is strong and near to

pi if our chief do not now take it it will hereafter be a sorrow to

his descendants

         confucius said chiu the superior man hates that declining

to say i want such and such a thing and framing explanations

for the conduct

         i have heard that rulers of states and chiefs of families

are not troubled lest their people should be few but are troubled

lest they should not keep their several places that they are not

troubled with fears of poverty but are troubled with fears of a

want of contented repose among the people in their several places

for when the people keep their several places there will be no

poverty when harmony prevails there will be no scarcity of

people and when there is such a contented repose there will be no

rebellious upsettings

         so it is therefore if remoter people are not submissive

all
the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to

attract them to be so and when they have been so attracted they

must be made contented and tranquil

         now here are you yu and chiu assisting your chief

remoter people are not submissive and with your help he cannot

attract them to him in his own territory there are divisions and

downfalls leavings and separations and with your help he cannot

preserve it

         and yet he is planning these hostile movements within

the state i am afraid that the sorrow of the chisun family will

not be on account of chwanyu but will be found within the screen

of their own court
        chap ii  confucius said when good government prevails

in the empire ceremonies music and punitive military expeditions

proceed from the son of heaven when bad government prevails in

the empire ceremonies music and punitive military expeditions

proceed from the princes when these things proceed from the

princes as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose

their power in ten generations when they proceed from the great

officers of the princes as a rule the cases will be few in which they

do not lose their power in five generations when the subsidiary

ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of the

state as a rule the cases will be few in which they do not lose their

power in three generations

         when right principles prevail in the kingdom government

will not be in the hands of the great officers

         when right principles prevail in the kingdom there will be

no discussions among the common people
        chap iii confucius said the revenue of the state has left

with the man of specious airs friendship with the insinuatingly

soft and friendship with the glibtongued these are injurious

        chap v confucius said there are three things men find

enjoyment in which are advantageous and three things they find

enjoyment in which are injurious to find enjoyment in the

discriminating study of ceremonies and music to find enjoyment in
speaking of the goodness of others to find enjoyment in having

many worthy friends these are advantageous to find enjoyment

in extravagant pleasures to find enjoyment in idleness and

sauntering to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting these

are injurious

        chap vi confucius said there are three errors to which

they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are

liable they may speak when it does not come to them to speak

this is called rashness they may not speak when it comes to them

to speak this is called concealment they may speak without

looking at the countenance of their superior this is called

blindness

        chap vii confucius said there are three things which the

superior man guards against in youth when the physical powers
are not yet settled he guards against lust when he is strong and

the physical powers are full of vigor he guards against

quarrelsomeness when he is old and the animal powers are

decayed he guards against covetousness

        chap viii  confucius said there are three things of which

the superior man stands in awe he stands in awe of the ordinances

of heaven he stands in awe of great men he stands in awe of the

words of sages

         the mean man does not know the ordinances of heaven

and consequently does not stand in awe of them he is disrespectful

to great men he makes sport of the words of sages

        chap ix confucius said those who are born with the

possession of knowledge are the highest class of men those who

learn and so readily get possession of knowledge are the next
those who are dull and stupid and yet compass the learning are

another class next to these as to those who are dull and stupid and

yet do not learn they are the lowest of the people

        chap x confucius said the superior man has nine things

which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration in regard

to the use of his eyes he is anxious to see clearly in regard to the

use of his ears he is anxious to hear distinctly in regard to his

countenance he is anxious that it should be benign in regard to his

demeanor he is anxious that it should be respectful in regard to

his speech he is anxious that it should be sincere in regard to his

doing of business he is anxious that it should be reverently careful

in regard to what he doubts about he is anxious to question others

when he is angry he thinks of the difficulties his anger may

involve him in when he sees gain to be got he thinks of

righteousness

        chap xi  confucius said contemplating good and pursuing

it as if they could not reach it contemplating evil and shrinking

from it as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water

i have seen such men as i have heard such words

         living in retirement to study their aims and practising
righteousness to carry out their principles i have heard these

words but i have not seen such men

        chap xii  the duke ching of chi had a thousand teams

each of four horses but on the day of his death the people did not

praise him for a single virtue poi and shuchi died of hunger at

the foot of the shauyang mountain and the people down to the

present time praise them

         is not that saying illustrated by this
        chap xiii  chan kang asked poyu saying have you

heard any lessons from your father different from what we have all

heard

         poyu replied no he was standing alone once when i

passed below the hall with hasty steps and said to me have you

learned the odes on my replying not yet he added if you do

not learn the odes you will not be fit to converse with i retired

and studied the odes
         another day he was in the same way standing alone when

i passed by below the hall with hasty steps and said to me have

you learned the rules of propriety on my replying not yet he

added if you do not learn the rules of propriety your character

cannot be established i then retired and learned the rules of

propriety

         i have heard only these two things from him

         chang kang retired and quite delighted said i asked one

thing and i have got three things i have heard about the odes i

have heard about the rules of propriety i have also heard that the

superior man maintains a distant reserve towards his son

        chap xiv the wife of the prince of a state is called by him

fu zan she calls herself hsiao tung the people of the state call
her chun fu zan and to the people of other states they call her

kwa hsiao chun the people of other states also call her chun fu

zan
book xvii yang ho
        chap i  yang ho wished to see confucius but confucius

would not go to see him on this he sent a present of a pig to

confucius who having chosen a time when ho was not at home

went to pay his respects for the gift he met him however on the

way

         ho said to confucius come let me speak with you he then

asked can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in his
bosom and leaves his country to confusion confucius replied no

can he be called wise who is anxious to be engaged in public

employment and yet is constantly losing the opportunity of being

so confucius again said no the days and months are passing

away the years do not wait for us confucius said right i will go

into office

        chap ii the master said by nature men are nearly alike

by practice they get to be wide apart

        chap iii the master said there are only the wise of the

highest class and the stupid of the lowest class who cannot be

changed
        chap iv  the master having come to wuchang heard

there the sound of stringed instruments and singing

         well pleased and smiling he said why use an ox knife to

kill a fowl

         tszeyu replied formerly master i heard you say

when the man of high station is well instructed he loves men

when the man of low station is well instructed he is easily ruled

         the master said my disciples yens words are right what

i said was only in sport

        chap v kungshan fuzao when he was holding pi and in

an attitude of rebellion invited the master to visit him who was

rather inclined to go

         tszelu was displeased and said indeed you cannot go

why must you think of going to see kungshan
         the master said can it be without some reason that he has

invited me if any one employ me may i not make an eastern

chau

        chap vi tszechang asked confucius about perfect virtue

confucius said to be able to practise five things everywhere under

heaven constitutes perfect virtue he begged to ask what they

were and was told gravity generosity of soul sincerity

earnestness and kindness if you are grave you will not be treated

with disrespect if you are generous you will win all if you are

sincere people will repose trust in you if you are earnest you will

accomplish much if you are kind this will enable you to employ

the services of others
        chap vii  pi hsi inviting him to visit him the master was

inclined to go

         tszelu said master formerly i have heard you say

when a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil a superior

man will not associate with him pi hsi is in rebellion holding

possession of chungmau if you go to him what shall be said

         the master said yes i did use these words but is it not

said that if a thing be really hard it may be ground without being

made thin is it not said that if a thing be really white it may be

steeped in a dark fluid without being made black

         am i a bitter gourd how can i be hung up out of the way

of being eaten
        chap viii  the master said yu have you heard the six

words to which are attached six becloudings yu replied i have

not

         sit down and i will tell them to you

         there is the love of being benevolent without the love of

learning the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity there is

the love of knowing without the love of learning the beclouding

here leads to dissipation of mind there is the love of being sincere

without the love of learning the beclouding here leads to an

injurious disregard of consequences there is the love of

straightforwardness without the love of learning the beclouding

here leads to rudeness there is the love of boldness without the

love of learning the beclouding here leads to insubordination

there is the love of firmness without the love of learning the

beclouding here leads to extravagant conduct
        chap ix  the master said my children why do you not



study the book of poetry



         the odes serve to stimulate the mind



         they may be used for purposes of selfcontemplation



         they teach the art of sociability



         they show how to regulate feelings of resentment



         from them you learn the more immediate duty of serving



ones father and the remoter one of serving ones prince



         from them we become largely acquainted with the names



of birds beasts and plants



        chap x the master said to poyu do you give yourself to



the chaunan and the shaonan the man who has not studied the



chaunan and the shaonan is like one who stands with his face



right against a wall is he not so

        chap xi the master said it is according to the rules of

propriety they say it is according to the rules of propriety

they say are gems and silk all that is meant by propriety it is

music they say it is music they say are bells and drums all

that is meant by music

        chap xii the master said he who puts on an appearance of

stern firmness while inwardly he is weak is like one of the small

mean people yea is he not like the thief who breaks through or

climbs over a wall

        chap xiii the master said your good careful people of the

villages are the thieves of virtue

        chap xiv the master said to tell as we go along what we

have heard on the way is to cast away our virtue
        chap xv  the master said there are those mean

creatures how impossible it is along with them to serve ones

prince

         while they have not got their aims their anxiety is how to

get them when they have got them their anxiety is lest they

should lose them

         when they are anxious lest such things should be lost

there is nothing to which they will not proceed

        chap xvi  the master said anciently men had three

failings which now perhaps are not to be found

         the highmindedness of antiquity showed itself in a

disregard of small things the highmindedness of the present day

shows itself in wild license the stern dignity of antiquity showed

itself in grave reserve the stern dignity of the present day shows

itself in quarrelsome perverseness the stupidity of antiquity

showed itself in straightforwardness the stupidity of the present

day shows itself in sheer deceit
        chap xvii the master said fine words and an insinuating

appearance are seldom associated with virtue

        chap xviii the master said i hate the manner in which

purple takes away the luster of vermilion i hate the way in which

the songs of chang confound the music of the ya i hate those who

with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms and families

        chap xix  the master said i would prefer not speaking

         tszekung said if you master do not speak what shall

we your disciples have to record

         the master said does heaven speak the four seasons

pursue their courses and all things are continually being produced

but does heaven say anything
        chap xx zu pei wished to see confucius but confucius

declined on the ground of being sick to see him when the bearer

of this message went out at the door the master took his lute and

sang to it in order that pei might hear him

        chap xxi  tsai wo asked about the three years mourning

for parents saying that one year was long enough

         if the superior man said he abstains for three years from

the observances of propriety those observances will be quite lost

if for three years he abstains from music music will be ruined

         within a year the old grain is exhausted and the new grain

has sprung up and in procuring fire by friction we go through all

the changes of wood for that purpose after a complete year the

mourning may stop

         the master said if you were after a year to eat good rice

and wear embroidered clothes would you feel at ease i should

replied wo
         the master said if you can feel at ease do it but a

superior man during the whole period of mourning does not enjoy

pleasant food which he may eat nor derive pleasure from music

which he may hear he also does not feel at ease if he is

comfortably lodged therefore he does not do what you propose

but now you feel at ease and may do it

         tsai wo then went out and the master said this shows

yus want of virtue it is not till a child is three years old that it is

allowed to leave the arms of its parents and the three years

mourning is universally observed throughout the empire did yu

enjoy the three years love of his parents
        chap xxii the master said hard is it to deal with him who

will stuff himself with food the whole day without applying his

mind to anything good are there not gamesters and chess players

to be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all

        chap xxiii tszelu said does the superior man esteem

valour the master said the superior man holds righteousness to

be of highest importance a man in a superior situation having

valour without righteousness will be guilty of insubordination one

of the lower people having valour without righteousness will

commit robbery

        chap xxiv  tszekung said has the superior man his

hatreds also the master said he has his hatreds he hates those

who proclaim the evil of others he hates the man who
being in a low station slanders his superiors he hates those who

have valour merely and are unobservant of propriety he hates

those who are forward and determined and at the same time of

contracted understanding

         the master then inquired tsze have you also your

hatreds tszekung replied i hate those who pry out matters and

ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom i hate those who are only

not modest and think that they are valourous i hate those who

make known secrets and think that they are straightforward

        chap xxv the master said of all people girls and servants

are the most difficult to behave to if you are familiar with them

they lose their humility if you maintain a reserve towards them

they are discontented

        chap xxvi the master said when a man at forty is the

object of dislike he will always continue what he is
book xviii wei tsze
        chap i  the viscount of wei withdrew from the court the

viscount of chi became a slave to chau pikan remonstrated with

him and died

         confucius said the yin dynasty possessed these three men

of virtue

        chap ii hui of liuhsia being chief criminal judge was

thrice dismissed from his office some one said to him is it not yet

time for you sir to leave this he replied serving men in an

upright way where shall i go to and not experience such a thrice

repeated
dismissal if i choose to serve men in a crooked way what

necessity is there for me to leave the country of my parents

        chap iii the duke ching of chi with reference to the

manner in which he should treat confucius said i cannot treat him

as i would the chief of the chi family i will treat him in a manner

between that accorded to the chief of the chi and that given to the

chief of the mang family he also said i am old i cannot use his

doctrines confucius took his departure

        chap iv the people of chi sent to lu a present of female

musicians which chi hwan received and for three days no court

was held confucius took his departure

        chap v  the madman of chu chiehyu passed by

confucius singing and saying o fang o fang how is your
virtue degenerated as to the past reproof is useless but the future

may still be provided against give up your vain pursuit give up

your vain pursuit peril awaits those who now engage in affairs of

government

         confucius alighted and wished to converse with him but

chiehyu hastened away so that he could not talk with him

        chap vi  changtsu and chiehni were at work in the field

together when confucius passed by them and sent tszelu to

inquire for the ford

         changtsu said who is he that holds the reins in the

carriage there tszelu told him it is kung chiu is it not kung

chiu of lu asked he yes was the reply to which the other

rejoined he knows the ford

         tszelu then inquired of chiehni who said to him who
are you sir he answered i am chung yu are you not the

disciple of kung chiu of lu asked the other i am replied he

and then chiehni said to him disorder like a swelling flood

spreads over the whole empire and who is he that will change its

state for you than follow one who merely withdraws from this

one and that one had you not better follow those who have

withdrawn from the world altogether with this he fell to covering

up the seed and proceeded with his work without stopping

         tszelu went and reported their remarks when the master

observed with a sigh it is impossible to associate with birds and

beasts as if they were the same with us if i associate not with

these people with mankind with whom shall i associate if

right principles prevailed through the empire there would be no

use for me to change its state
        chap vii  tszelu following the master happened to fall

behind when he met an old man carrying across his shoulder on a

staff a basket for weeds tszelu said to him have you seen my

master sir the old man replied your four limbs are

unaccustomed to toil you cannot distinguish the five kinds of

grain who is your master with this he planted his staff in the

ground and proceeded to weed

         tszelu joined his hands across his breast and stood before

him

         the old man kept tszelu to pass the night in his house

killed a fowl prepared millet and feasted him he also introduced

to him his two sons

         next day tszelu went on his way and reported his

adventure the master said he is a recluse and sent tszelu back

to see him again but when he got to the place the old man was

gone

         tszelu then said to the family not to take office is not
righteous if the relations between old and young may not be

neglected how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be

observed between sovereign and minister wishing to maintain his

personal purity he allows that great relation to come to confusion

a superior man takes office and performs the righteous duties

belonging to it as to the failure of right principles to make

progress he is aware of that

        chap viii  the men who have retired to privacy from the

world have been poi shuchi yuchung iyi chuchang hui of

liuhsia and shaolien

         the master said refusing to surrender their wills or to

submit to any taint in their persons such i think were poi and

shuchi

         it may be said of hui of liuhsia and of shaolien that

they surrendered their wills and submitted to taint in their

persons
but their words corresponded with reason and their actions were

such as men are anxious to see this is all that is to be remarked in

them

         it may be said of yuchung and iyi that while they hid

themselves in their seclusion they gave a license to their words

but in their persons they succeeded in preserving their purity

and in their retirement they acted according to the exigency of the

times

         i am different from all these i have no course for which i

am predetermined and no course against which i am

predetermined

        chap ix  the grand music master chih went to chi

         kan the master of the band at the second meal went to

chu liao the band master at the third meal went to tsai chueh

the band master at the fourth meal went to chin

         fangshu the drum master withdrew to the north of the

river
         wu the master of the hand drum withdrew to the han

         yang the assistant music master and hsiang master of the

musical stone withdrew to an island in the sea

        chap x the duke of chau addressed his son the duke of lu

saying the virtuous prince does not neglect his relations he does

not cause the great ministers to repine at his not employing them

without some great cause he does not dismiss from their offices

the members of old families he does not seek in one man talents

for every employment

        chap xi to chau belonged the eight officers pota po
kwo chungtu chunghwu shuya shuhsia chisui and chikwa
book xix tszechang
        chap i tszechang said the scholar trained for public duty

seeing threatening danger is prepared to sacrifice his life when

the opportunity of gain is presented to him he thinks of

righteousness in sacrificing his thoughts are reverential in

mourning his thoughts are about the grief which he should feel

such a man commands our approbation indeed

        chap ii tszechang said when a man holds fast to virtue

but without seeking to enlarge it and believes right principles but

without firm sincerity what account can be made of his existence

or nonexistence
        chap iii the disciples of tszehsia asked tszechang about

the principles that should characterize mutual intercourse tsze

chang asked what does tszehsia say on the subject they

replied tszehsia says associate with those who can advantage

you put away from you those who cannot do so tszechang

observed this is different from what i have learned the superior

man honours the talented and virtuous and bears with all he

praises the good and pities the incompetent am i possessed of

great talents and virtue who is there among men whom i will

not bear with am i devoid of talents and virtue men will put

me away from them what have we to do with the putting away of

others

        chap iv tszehsia said even in inferior studies and

employments there is something worth being looked at but if it be
attempted to carry them out to what is remote there is a danger of

their proving inapplicable therefore the superior man does not

practise them

        chap v tszehsia said he who from day to day recognises

what he has not yet and from month to month does not forget what

he has attained to may be said indeed to love to learn

        chap vi tszehsia said there are learning extensively and

having a firm and sincere aim inquiring with earnestness and

reflecting with selfapplication virtue is in such a course

        chap vii tszehsia said mechanics have their shops to

dwell in in order to accomplish their works the superior man

learns in order to reach to the utmost of his principles
        chap viii tszehsia said the mean man is sure to gloss his

faults

        chap ix tszehsia said the superior man undergoes three

changes looked at from a distance he appears stern when

approached he is mild when he is heard to speak his language is

firm and decided

        chap x tszehsia said the superior man having obtained

their confidence may then impose labours on his people if he have

not gained their confidence they will think that he is oppressing

them having obtained the confidence of his prince one may then

remonstrate with him if he have not gained his confidence the

prince will think that he is vilifying him

        chap xi tszehsia said when a person does not transgress

the boundary line in the great virtues he may pass and repass it in

the small virtues
        chap xii  tszeyu said the disciples and followers of

tszehsia in sprinkling and sweeping the ground in answering and

replying in advancing and receding are sufficiently accomplished

but these are only the branches of learning and they are left

ignorant of what is essential how can they be acknowledged as

sufficiently taught

         tszehsia heard of the remark and said alas yen yu is

wrong according to the way of the superior man in teaching what

departments are there which he considers of prime importance and

delivers what are there which he considers of secondary

importance and allows himself to be idle about but as in the case

of plants which are assorted according to their classes so he deals

with his disciples how can the way of a superior man be such as to

make fools of any of them is it not the sage alone who can unite

in one the beginning and the consummation of learning
        chap xiii tszehsia said the officer having discharged all

his duties should devote his leisure to learning the student having

completed his learning should apply himself to be an officer

        chap xiv tszehsia said mourning having been carried to

the utmost degree of grief should stop with that

        chap xv tszehsia said my friend chang can do things

which are hard to be done but yet he is not perfectly virtuous

        chap xvi the philosopher tsang said how imposing is the

manner of chang it is difficult along with him to practise virtue

        chap xvii the philosopher tsang said i heard this from

our master men may not have shown what is in them to the full

extent and yet they will be found to do so on occasion of mourning

for their parents
        chap xviii the philosopher tsang said i have heard this

from our master the filial piety of mang chwang in other

matters was what other men are competent to but as seen in his

not changing the ministers of his father nor his fathers mode of

government it is difficult to be attained to

        chap xix the chief of the mang family having appointed

yang fu to be chief criminal judge the latter consulted the

philosopher tsang tsang said the rulers have failed in their

duties and the people consequently have been disorganised for a

long time when you have found out the truth of any accusation be

grieved for and pity them and do not feel joy at your own ability

        chap xx tszekung said chaus wickedness was not so great

as that name implies therefore the superior man hates to dwell
in a lowlying situation where all the evil of the world will flow in

upon him

        chap xxi tszekung said the faults of the superior man are

like the eclipses of the sun and moon he has his faults and all men

see them he changes again and all men look up to him

        chap xxii  kungsun chao of wei asked tszekung

saying from whom did chungni get his learning

         tszekung replied the doctrines of wan and wu have not

yet fallen to the ground they are to be found among men men of

talents and virtue remember the greater principles of them and

others not possessing such talents and virtue remember the

smaller thus all possess the doctrines of wan and wu where

could our master go that he should not have an opportunity of

learning them and yet what necessity was there for his having a

regular master
        chap xxiii  shusun wushu observed to the great

officers in the court saying tszekung is superior to chungni

         tszefu chingpo reported the observation to tszekung

who said let me use the comparison of a house and its

encompassing wall my wall only reaches to the shoulders one may

peep over it and see whatever is valuable in the apartments

         the wall of my master is several fathoms high if one do

not find the door and enter by it he cannot see the ancestral

temple with its beauties nor all the officers in their rich array

         but i may assume that they are few who find the door

was not the observation of the chief only what might have been

expected
        chap xxiv shusun wushu having spoken revilingly of

chungni tszekung said it is of no use doing so chungni cannot

be reviled the talents and virtue of other men are hillocks and

mounds which may be stepped over chungni is the sun or moon

which it is not possible to step over although a man may wish to

cut himself off from the sage what harm can he do to the sun or

moon he only shows that he does not know his own capacity

        chap xxv  chan tszechin addressing tszekung said

you are too modest how can chungni be said to be superior to

you

         tszekung said to him for one word a man is often

deemed to be wise and for one word he is often deemed to be

foolish we ought to be careful indeed in what we say

         our master cannot be attained to just in the same way as

the heavens cannot be gone up to by the steps of a stair
         were our master in the position of the ruler of a state or

the chief of a family we should find verified the description which

has been given of a sages rule he would plant the people and

forthwith they would be established he would lead them on and

forthwith they would follow him he would make them happy and

forthwith multitudes would resort to his dominions he would

stimulate them and forthwith they would be harmonious while he

lived he would be glorious when he died he would be bitterly

lamented how is it possible for him to be attained to
book xx yao yueh
        chap i  yao said oh you shun the heavendetermined

order of succession now rests in your person sincerely hold fast the

due mean if there shall be distress and want within the four seas

the heavenly revenue will come to a perpetual end

         shun also used the same language in giving charge to yu

         tang said i the child li presume to use a darkcoloured

victim and presume to announce to thee o most great and

sovereign god that the sinner i dare not pardon and thy ministers

o god i do not keep in obscurity the examination of them is by

thy mind o god if in my person i commit offences they are not to

be attributed to you the people of the myriad regions if you in the

myriad regions commit offences these offences must rest on my

person
         chau conferred great gifts and the good were enriched

         although he has his near relatives they are not equal to

my virtuous men the people are throwing blame upon me the one

man

         he carefully attended to the weights and measures

examined the body of the laws restored the discarded officers and

the good government of the kingdom took its course

         he revived states that had been extinguished restored

families whose line of succession had been broken and called to

office those who had retired into obscurity so that throughout the

kingdom the hearts of the people turned towards him

         what he attached chief importance to were the food of the

people the duties of mourning and sacrifices

         by his generosity he won all by his sincerity he made the

people repose trust in him by his earnest activity his

achievements were great by his justice all were delighted
        chap ii  tszechang asked confucius saying in what way

should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct

government properly the master replied let him honour the five

excellent and banish away the four bad things then may he

conduct government properly tszechang said what are meant by

the five excellent things the master said when the person in

authority is beneficent without great expenditure when he lays

tasks on the people without their repining when he pursues what

he desires without being covetous when he maintains a dignified

ease without being proud when he is majestic without being fierce

         tszechang said what is meant by being beneficent

without great expenditure the master replied when the person

in authority makes more beneficial to the people the things from

which
they naturally derive benefit is not this being beneficent without

great expenditure when he chooses the labours which are proper

and makes them labour on them who will repine when his desires

are set on benevolent government and he secures it who will

accuse him of covetousness whether he has to do with many

people or few or with things great or small he does not dare to

indicate any disrespect is not this to maintain a dignified ease

without any pride he adjusts his clothes and cap and throws a

dignity into his looks so that thus dignified he is looked at with

awe is not this to be majestic without being fierce

         tszechang then asked what are meant by the four bad

things the master said to put the people to death without having

instructed them this is called cruelty to require from them

suddenly the full tale of work without having given them

warning this is called oppression to issue orders as if without

urgency at first and when the time comes to insist on them with

severity this is called injury and generally in the giving pay
or rewards to men to do it in a stingy way this is called acting

the part of a mere official

        chap iii  the master said without recognising the

ordinances of heaven it is impossible to be a superior man

         without an acquaintance with the rules of propriety it is

impossible for the character to be established

         without knowing the force of words it is impossible to

know men
