the birth of tragedy


 introduction1
frederick nietzsche was born at rcken near ltzen in the prussian

province of saxony on the 15th of october 1844 at 10 am the day

happened to be the anniversary of the birth of frederickwilliam iv

then king of prussia and the peal of the local churchbells which was

intended to celebrate this event was by a happy coincidence just

timed to greet my brother on his entrance into the world in 1841

at the time when our father was tutor to the altenburg princesses

theresa of saxealtenburg elizabeth grand duchess of oldenburg and

alexandra grand duchess constantine of russia he had had the honour

of being presented to his witty and pious sovereign the meeting seems

to have impressed both parties very favourably for very shortly

after it had taken place our father received his living at rcken by

supreme command his joy may well be imagined therefore when a first

son was born to him on his belovedpg i and august patrons birthday and

at the christening ceremony he spoke as followsthou blessed month

of octoberfor many years the most decisive events in my life have

occurred within thy thirtyone days and now i celebrate the greatest

and most glorious of them all by baptising my little boy o blissful

moment o exquisite festival o unspeakably holy duty in the lords

name i bless theewith all my heart i utter these words bring me

this my beloved child that i may consecrate it unto the lord my son

frederick william thus shalt thou be named on earth as a memento of

my royal benefactor on whose birthday thou wast born
our father was thirtyone years of age and our mother not quite

nineteen when my brother was born our mother who was the daughter

of a clergyman was goodlooking and healthy and was one of a very

large family of sons and daughters our paternal grandparents the

rev oehler and his wife in pobles were typically healthy people

strength robustness lively dispositions and a cheerful outlook on

life were among the qualities which every one was pleased to observe

in them our grandfather oehler was a bright clever man and quite

the old style of comfortable country parson who thought it no sin to

go hunting he scarcely had a days illness in his life and would

certainly not have met with his end as early as he didthat is to say

before his seventieth yearif his careless disregard of all caution

where his health was concerned had not led to his catching a severe

and fatal cold in regard to ourpg ii grandmother oehler who died in her

eightysecond year all that can be said is that if all german women

were possessed of the health she enjoyed the german nation would excel

all others from the standpoint of vitality she bore our grandfather

eleven children gave each of them the breast for nearly the whole of

its first year and reared them all it is said that the sight of these

eleven children at ages varying from nineteen years to one month with

their powerful build rosy cheeks beaming eyes and wealth of curly

locks provoked the admiration of all visitors of course despite

their extraordinarily good health the life of this family was not

by any means all sunshine each of the children was very spirited

wilful and obstinate and it was therefore no simple matter to keep

them in order moreover though they always showed the utmost respect

and most implicit obedience to their parentseven as middleaged

men and womenmisunderstandings between themselves were of constant

occurrence our oehler grandparents were fairly welltodo for our

grandmother hailed from a very old family who had been extensive

landowners in the neighbourhood of zeitz for centuries and her father

owned the baronial estate of wehlitz and a magnificent seat near zeitz

in pacht when she married her father gave her carriages and horses

a coachman a cook and a kitchenmaid which for the wife of a german

minister was then and is still something quite exceptional as a

result of the wars in the beginning of the nineteenth century however

our greatgrandfather lost the greater part of his property
pg iii
our fathers family was also in fairly comfortable circumstances

and likewise very large our grandfather dr nietzsche dd and

superintendent married twice and had in all twelve children of whom

three died young our grandfather on this side whom i never knew

must certainly have been a distinguished dignified very learned

and reserved man his second wifeour beloved grandmotherwas an

activeminded intelligent and exceptionally goodnatured woman

the whole of our fathers family which i only got to know when they

were very advanced in years were remarkable for their great power of

selfcontrol their lively interest in intellectual matters and a

strong sense of family unity which manifested itself both in their

splendid readiness to help one another and in their very excellent

relations with each other our father was the youngest son and thanks

to his uncommonly lovable disposition together with other gifts which

only tended to become more marked as he grew older he was quite the

favourite of the family blessed with a thoroughly sound constitution

as all averred who knew him at the conventschool in rossleben at

the university or later at the ducal court of altenburg he was tall

and slender possessed an undoubted gift for poetry and real musical

talent and was moreover a man of delicate sensibilities full of

consideration for his whole family and distinguished in his manners
my brother often refers to his polish descent and in later years

he even instituted researchwork with the view of establishing it

which met with partial success i know nothing definite concerning

thesepg iv investigations because a large number of valuable documents

were unfortunately destroyed after his breakdown in turin the family

tradition was that a certain polish nobleman nicki pronounced nietzky

had obtained the special favour of augustus the strong king of

poland and had received the rank of earl from him when however

stanislas leszcysski the pole became king our supposed ancestor became

involved in a conspiracy in favour of the saxons and protestants he

was sentenced to death but taking flight according to the evidence

of the documents he was ultimately befriended by a certain earl of

brhl who gave him a small post in an obscure little provincial town

occasionally our aged aunts would speak of our greatgrandfather

nietzsche who was said to have died in his ninetyfirst year and

words always seemed to fail them when they attempted to describe his

handsome appearance good breeding and vigour our ancestors both on

the nietzsche and the oehler side were very longlived of the four

pairs of greatgrandparents one greatgrandfather reached the age of

ninety five greatgrandmothers andfathers died between eightytwo and

eightysix years of age and two only failed to reach their seventieth

year
the sorrow which hung as a cloud over our branch of the family

was our fathers death as the result of a heavy fall at the age

of thirtyeight one night upon leaving some friends whom he had

accompanied home he was met at the door of the vicarage by our little

dog the little animal must have got between his feet for he stumbled

and fellpg v backwards down seven stone steps on to the pavingstones

of the vicarage courtyard as a result of this fall he was laid up

with concussion of the brain and after a lingering illness which

lasted eleven months he died on the 30th of july 1849 the early

death of our beloved and highlygifted father spread gloom over

the whole of our childhood in 1850 our mother withdrew with us to

naumburg on the saale where she took up her abode with our widowed

grandmother nietzsche and there she brought us up with spartan

severity and simplicity which besides being typical of the period

was quite de rigeur in her family of course grandmamma nietzsche

helped somewhat to temper her daughterinlaws severity and in this

respect our oehler grandparents who were less rigorous with us

their eldest grandchildren than with their own children were also

very influential grandfather oehler was the first who seems to have

recognised the extraordinary talents of his eldest grandchild
from his earliest childhood upwards my brother was always strong

and healthy he often declared that he must have been taken for a

peasantboy throughout his childhood and youth as he was so plump

brown and rosy the thick fair hair which fell picturesquely over his

shoulders tended somewhat to modify his robust appearance had he not

possessed those wonderfully beautiful large and expressive eyes

however and had he not been so very ceremonious in his manner neither

his teachers nor his relatives would ever have noticed anything at all

remarkable about the boy for he was both modest and reserved
pg vi
he received his early schooling at a preparatory school and later

at a grammar school in naumburg in the autumn of 1858 when he was

fourteen years of age he entered the pforta school so famous for the

scholars it has produced there too very severe discipline prevailed

and much was exacted from the pupils with the view of inuring them

to great mental and physical exertions thus if my brother seems

to lay particular stress upon the value of rigorous training free

from all sentimentality it should be remembered that he speaks from

experience in this respect at pforta he followed the regular school

course and he did not enter a university until the comparatively late

age of twenty his extraordinary gifts manifested themselves chiefly

in his independent and private studies and artistic efforts as a boy

his musical talent had already been so noticeable that he himself

and other competent judges were doubtful as to whether he ought not

perhaps to devote himself altogether to music it is however worth

noting that everything he did in his later years whether in latin

greek or german work bore the stamp of perfectionsubject of course

to the limitation imposed upon him by his years his talents came very

suddenly to the fore because he had allowed them to grow for such a

long time in concealment his very first performance in philology

executed while he was a student under ritschl the famous philologist

was also typical of him in this respect seeing that it was ordered

to be printed for the rheinische museum of course this was done

amid general and grave expressions of doubt for as dr ritschl often

declaredpg vii it was an unheardof occurrence for a student in his third

term to prepare such an excellent treatise
being a great lover of outdoor exercise such as swimming skating

and walking he developed into a very sturdy lad rohde gives the

following description of him as a student with his healthy complexion

his outward and inner cleanliness his austere chastity and his solemn

aspect he was the image of that delightful youth described by adalbert

stifter
though as a child he was always rather serious as a lad and a man he

was ever inclined to see the humorous side of things while his whole

being and everything he said or did was permeated by an extraordinary

harmony he belonged to the very few who could control even a bad mood

and conceal it from others all his friends are unanimous in their

praise of his exceptional evenness of temper and behaviour and his

warm hearty and pleasant laugh that seemed to come from the very

depths of his benevolent and affectionate nature in him it might

therefore be said nature had produced a being who in body and spirit

was a harmonious whole his unusual intellect was fully in keeping with

his uncommon bodily strength
the only abnormal thing about him and something which we both

inherited from our father was shortsightedness and this was

very much aggravated in my brothers case even in his earliest

schooldays owing to that indescribable anxiety to learn which always

characterised him when one listens to accounts given by his friends

and schoolfellows one is startled by the multiplicity of his studies

even in his schooldays
pg viii
in the autumn of 1864 he began his university life in bonn and

studied philology and theology at the end of six months he gave up

theology and in the autumn of 1865 followed his famous teacher ritschl

to the university of leipzig there he became an ardent philologist

and diligently sought to acquire a masterly grasp of this branch of

knowledge but in this respect it would be unfair to forget that the

school of pforta with its staff of excellent teachersscholars

that would have adorned the chairs of any universityhad already

afforded the best of preparatory trainings to any one intending to

take up philology as a study more particularly as it gave all pupils

ample scope to indulge any individual tastes they might have for any

particular branch of ancient history the last important latin thesis

which my brother wrote for the landesschule pforta dealt with

the megarian poet theognis and it was in the rle of a lecturer on

this very subject that on the 18th january 1866 he made his first

appearance in public before the philological society he had helped to

found in leipzig the paper he read disclosed his investigations on

the subject of theognis the moralist and aristocrat who as is well

known described and dismissed the plebeians of his time in terms of

the heartiest contempt the aristocratic ideal which was always so

dear to my brother thus revealed itself for the first time moreover

curiously enough it was precisely this scientific thesis which was

the cause of ritschls recognition of my brother and fondness for him
the whole of his leipzig days proved of thepg ix utmost importance to my

brothers career there he was plunged into the very midst of a torrent

of intellectual influences which found an impressionable medium in

the fiery youth and to which he eagerly made himself accessible

he did not however forget to discriminate among them but tested

and criticised the currents of thought he encountered and selected

accordingly it is certainly of great importance to ascertain what

those influences precisely were to which he yielded and how long

they maintained their sway over him and it is likewise necessary to

discover exactly when the matured mind threw off these fetters in order

to work out its own salvation
the influences that exercised power over him in those days may be

described in the three following terms hellenism schopenhauer

wagner his love of hellenism certainly led him to philology but as

a matter of fact what concerned him most was to obtain a wide view

of things in general and this he hoped to derive from that science

philology in itself with his splendid method and thorough way of going

to work served him only as a means to an end
if hellenism was the first strong influence which already in pforta

obtained a sway over my brother in the winter of 186566 a completely

new and therefore somewhat subversive influence was introduced into

his life with schopenhauers philosophy when he reached leipzig in

the autumn of 1865 he was very downcast for the experiences that

had befallen him during his one year of student life in bonn had

deeply depressed him he hadpg x sought at first to adapt himself to his

surroundings there with the hope of ultimately elevating them to his

lofty views on things but both these efforts proved vain and now he

had come to leipzig with the purpose of framing his own manner of life

it can easily be imagined how the first reading of schopenhauers the

world as will and idea worked upon this man still stinging from the

bitterest experiences and disappointments he writes here i saw a

mirror in which i espied the world life and my own nature depicted

with frightful grandeur as my brother from his very earliest

childhood had always missed both the parent and the educator through

our fathers untimely death he began to regard schopenhauer with

almost filial love and respect he did not venerate him quite as other

men did schopenhauers personality was what attracted and enchanted

him from the first he was never blind to the faults in his masters

system and in proof of this we have only to refer to an essay he

wrote in the autumn of 1867 which actually contains a criticism of

schopenhauers philosophy
now in the autumn of 1865 to these two influences hellenism and

schopenhauer a third influence was addedone which was to prove

the strongest ever exercised over my brotherand it began with his

personal introduction to richard wagner he was introduced to wagner by

the latters sister frau professor brockhaus and his description of

their first meeting contained in a letter to erwin rohde is really

most affecting for years that is to say from the time billowspg xi

arrangement of tristan and isolde for the pianoforte had appeared

he had already been a passionate admirer of wagners music but now

that the artist himself entered upon the scene of his life with the

whole fascinating strength of his strong will my brother felt that he

was in the presence of a being whom he of all modern men resembled

most in regard to force of character
again in the case of richard wagner my brother from the first laid

the utmost stress upon the mans personality and could only regard

his works and views as an expression of the artists whole being

despite the fact that he by no means understood every one of those

works at that time my brother was the first who ever manifested such

enthusiastic affection for schopenhauer and wagner and he was also the

first of that numerous band of young followers who ultimately inscribed

the two great names upon their banner whether schopenhauer and wagner

ever really corresponded to the glorified pictures my brother painted

of them both in his letters and other writings is a question which we

can no longer answer in the affirmative perhaps what he saw in them

was only what he himself wished to be some day
the amount of work my brother succeeded in accomplishing during his

student days really seems almost incredible when we examine his

record for the years 186567 we can scarcely believe it refers to only

two years industry for at a guess no one would hesitate to suggest

four years at least but in those days as he himselfpg xii declares he

still possessed the constitution of a bear he knew neither what

headaches nor indigestion meant and despite his short sight his eyes

were able to endure the greatest strain without giving him the smallest

trouble that is why regardless of seriously interrupting his studies

he was so glad at the thought of becoming a soldier in the forthcoming

autumn of 1867 for he was particularly anxious to discover some means

of employing his bodily strength
he discharged his duties as a soldier with the utmost mental and

physical freshness was the crack rider among the recruits of his year

and was sincerely sorry when owing to an accident he was compelled to

leave the colours before the completion of his service as a result of

this accident he had his first dangerous illness
while mounting his horse one day the beast which was an uncommonly

restive one suddenly reared and causing him to strike his chest

sharply against the pommel of the saddle threw him to the ground my

brother then made a second attempt to mount and succeeded this time

notwithstanding the fact that he had severely sprained and torn two

muscles in his chest and had seriously bruised the adjacent ribs for

a whole day he did his utmost to pay no heed to the injury and to

overcome the pain it caused him but in the end he only swooned and a

dangerously acute inflammation of the injured tissues was the result

ultimately he was obliged to consult the famous specialist professor

volkmann in halle who quickly put him right
pg xiii
in october 1868 my brother returned to his studies in leipzig with

double joy these were his plans to get his doctors degree as soon as

possible to proceed to paris italy and greece make a lengthy stay

in each place and then to return to leipzig in order to settle there

as a privat docent all these plans were however suddenly frustrated

owing to his premature call to the university of bale where he was

invited to assume the duties of professor some of the philological

essays he had written in his student days and which were published

by the rheinische museum had attracted the attention of the

educational board at bale ratsherr wilhelm vischer as representing

this body appealed to ritschl for fuller information now ritschl

who had early recognised my brothers extraordinary talents must have

written a letter of such enthusiastic praise nietzsche is a genius

he can do whatever he chooses to put his mind to that one of the

more cautious members of the council is said to have observed if

the proposed candidate be really such a genius then it were better

did we not appoint him for in any case he would only stay a short

time at the little university of bale my brother ultimately accepted

the appointment and in view of his published philological works

he was immediately granted the doctors degree by the university of

leipzig he was twentyfour years and six months old when he took up

his position as professor in baleand it was with a heavy heart that

he proceeded there for he knew the goldenpg xiv period of untrammelled

activity must cease he was however inspired by the deep wish of

being able to transfer to his pupils some of that schopenhauerian

earnestness which is stamped on the brow of the sublime man i

should like to be something more than a mere trainer of capable

philologists the present generation of teachers the care of the

growing broodsall this is in my mind if we must live let us at

least do so in such wise that others may bless our life once we have

been peacefully delivered from its toils
when i look back upon that month of may 1869 and ask both of friends

and of myself what the figure of this youthful university professor

of fourandtwenty meant to the world at that time the reply is

naturally in the first place that he was one of ritschls best

pupils secondly that he was an exceptionally capable exponent of

classical antiquity with a brilliant career before him and thirdly

that he was a passionate adorer of wagner and schopenhauer but no one

has any idea of my brothers independent attitude to the science he

had selected to his teachers and to his ideals and he deceived both

himself and us when he passed as a disciple who really shared all the

views of his respected master
on the 28th may 1869 my brother delivered his inaugural address

at bale university and it is said to have deeply impressed the

authorities the subject of the address was homer and classical

philology
musing deeply the worthy councillors andpg xv professors walked homeward

what had they just heard a young scholar discussing the very

justification of his own science in a cool and philosophically critical

spirit a man able to impart so much artistic glamour to his subject

that the once stale and arid study of philology suddenly struck

themand they were certainly not impressionable menas the messenger

of the gods and just as the muses descended upon the dull and

tormented boeotian peasants so philology comes into a world full of

gloomy colours and pictures full of the deepest most incurable woes

and speaks to men comfortingly of the beautiful and brilliant godlike

figure of a distant blue and happy fairyland
we have indeed got hold of a rare bird herr ratsherr said one of

these gentlemen to his companion and the latter heartily agreed for

my brothers appointment had been chiefly his doing
even in leipzig it was reported that jacob burckhardt had said

nietzsche is as much an artist as a scholar privycouncillor

ritschl told me of this himself and then he added with a smile i

always said so he can make his scientific discourses as palpitatingly

interesting as a french novelist his novels
homer and classical philologymy brothers inaugural address at

the universitywas by no means the first literary attempt he had

made for we have already seen that he had had papers published by the

rheinische museum still this particular discourse is importantpg xvi

seeing that it practically contains the programme of many other

subsequent essays i must however emphasise this fact here that

neither homer and classical philology nor the birth of tragedy

represents a beginning in my brothers career it is really surprising

to see how very soon he actually began grappling with the questions

which were to prove the problems of his life if a beginning to his

intellectual development be sought at all then it must be traced

to the years 186567 in leipzig the birth of tragedy his maiden

attempt at bookwriting with which he began his twentyeighth year

is the last link of a long chain of developments and the first fruit

that was a long time coming to maturity nietzsches was a polyphonic

nature in which the most different and apparently most antagonistic

talents had come together philosophy art and sciencein the form

of philology theneach certainly possessed a part of him the

most wonderful featureperhaps it might even be called the real

nietzschean featureof this versatile creature was the fact that

no eternal strife resulted from the juxtaposition of these inimical

traits that not one of them strove to dislodge or to get the upper

hand of the others when nietzsche renounced the musical career in

order to devote himself to philology and gave himself up to the most

strenuous study he did not find it essential completely to suppress

his other tendencies as before he continued both to compose and

derive pleasure from music andpg xvii even studied counterpoint somewhat

seriously moreover during his years at leipzig when he consciously

gave himself up to philological research he began to engross himself

in schopenhauer and was thereby won by philosophy for ever everything

that could find room took up its abode in him and these juxtaposed

factors far from interfering with one anothers existence were rather

mutually fertilising and stimulating all those who have read the first

volume of the biography with attention must have been struck with the

perfect way in which the various impulses in his nature combined in

the end to form one general torrent and how this flowed with ever

greater force in the direction of a single goal thus science art

and philosophy developed and became ever more closely related in him

until in the birth of tragedy they brought forth a centaur that

is to say a work which would have been an impossible achievement to

a man with only a single special talent this polyphony of different

talents all coming to utterance together and producing the richest

and boldest of harmonies is the fundamental feature not only of

nietzsches early days but of his whole development it is once again

the artist philosopher and man of science who as one man in later

years after many wanderings recantations and revulsions of feeling

produces that other and rarer centaur of highest rankzarathustra
the birth of tragedy requires perhaps a little explainingmore

particularly as we have nowpg xviii ceased to use either schopenhauerian or

wagnerian terms of expression and it was for this reason that five

years after its appearance my brother wrote an introduction to it

in which he very plainly expresses his doubts concerning the views it

contains and the manner in which they are presented the kernel of its

thought he always recognised as perfectly correct and all he deplored

in later days was that he had spoiled the grand problem of hellenism

as he understood it by adulterating it with ingredients taken from the

world of most modern ideas as time went on he grew ever more and more

anxious to define the deep meaning of this book with greater precision

and clearness a very good elucidation of its aims which unfortunately

was never published appears among his notes of the year 1886 and is

as follows
concerning the birth of tragedya book consisting of mere

experiences relating to pleasurable and unpleasurable sthetic states

with a metaphysicoartistic background at the same time the confession

of a romanticist the sufferer feels the deepest longing for beautyhe

begets it finally a product of youth full of youthful courage and

melancholy
fundamental psychological experiences the word apollonian stands

for that state of rapt repose in the presence of a visionary world

in the presence of the world of beautiful appearance designed as a

deliverance from becoming the word dionysos on the other hand

stands for strenuous becoming grown selfconscious in thepg xix form

of the rampant voluptuousness of the creator who is also perfectly

conscious of the violent anger of the destroyer
the antagonism of these two attitudes and the desires that underlie

them the firstnamed would have the vision it conjures up eternal

in its light man must be quiescent apathetic peaceful healed and

on friendly terms with himself and all existence the second strives

after creation after the voluptuousness of wilful creation ie

constructing and destroying creation felt and explained as an instinct

would be merely the unremitting inventive action of a dissatisfied

being overflowing with wealth and living at high tension and high

pressureof a god who would overcome the sorrows of existence by

means only of continual changes and transformationsappearance as a

transient and momentary deliverance the world as an apparent sequence

of godlike visions and deliverances
this metaphysicoartistic attitude is opposed to schopenhauers

onesided view which values art not from the artists standpoint but

from the spectators because it brings salvation and deliverance

by means of the joy produced by unreal as opposed to the existing

or the real the experience only of him who is suffering and is in

despair owing to himself and everything existingdeliverance in

the form and its eternity just as plato may have pictured it save

that he rejoiced in a complete subordination of all too excitable

sensibilities even in the idea itself to this is opposed the second

point of viewart regardedpg xx as a phenomenon of the artist above all

of the musician the torture of being obliged to create as a dionysian

instinct
tragic art rich in both attitudes represents the reconciliation of

apollo and dionysos appearance is given the greatest importance by

dionysos and yet it will be denied and cheerfully denied this is

directed against schopenhauers teaching of resignation as the tragic

attitude towards the world
against wagners theory that music is a means and drama an end
a desire for tragic myth for religion and even pessimistic religion

as for a forcing frame in which certain plants flourish
mistrust of science although its ephemerally soothing optimism be

strongly felt the serenity of the theoretical man
deep antagonism to christianity why the degeneration of the germanic

spirit is ascribed to its influence
any justification of the world can only be an sthetic one profound

suspicions about morality it is part and parcel of the world of

appearance
the happiness of existence is only possible as the happiness derived

from appearance being is a fiction invented by those who suffer

from becoming
happiness in becoming is possible only in the annihilation of

the real of the existing of the beautifully visionaryin the

pessimistic dissipation of illusionswith the annihilationpg xxi of

the most beautiful phenomena in the world of appearance dionysian

happiness reaches its zenith
the birth of tragedy is really only a portion of a much greater work

on hellenism which my brother had always had in view from the time of

his student days but even the portion it represents was originally

designed upon a much larger scale than the present one the reason

probably being that nietzsche desired only to be of service to wagner

when a certain portion of the projected work on hellenism was ready

and had received the title greek cheerfulness my brother happened

to call upon wagner at tribschen in april 1871 and found him very

lowspirited in regard to the mission of his life my brother was very

anxious to take some decisive step to help him and laying the plans

of his great work on greece aside he selected a small portion from

the already completed manuscripta portion dealing with one distinct

side of hellenismto wit its tragic art he then associated wagners

music with it and the name dionysos and thus took the first step

towards that worldhistorical view through which we have since grown

accustomed to regard wagner
from the dates of the various notes relating to it the birth of

tragedy must have been written between the autumn of 1869 and november

1871a period during which a mass of sthetic questions and answers

was fermenting in nietzsches mind it was first published in january

1872 by e w fritsch in leipzigpg xxii under the title the birth of

tragedy out of the spirit of music later on the title was changed to

the birth of tragedy or hellenism and pessimism

 an attempt at selfcriticism
i
whatever may lie at the bottom of this doubtful book must be a

question of the first rank and attractiveness moreover a deeply

personal questionin proof thereof observe the time in which it

originated in spite of which it originated the exciting period

of the francogerman war of 187071 while the thunder of the battle

of wrth rolled over europe the ruminator and riddlelover who had

to be the parent of this book sat somewhere in a nook of the alps

lost in riddles and ruminations consequently very much concerned and

unconcerned at the same time and wrote down his meditations on the

greeksthe kernel of the curious and almost inaccessible book to

which this belated prologue or epilogue is to be devoted a few weeks

later and he found himself under the walls of metz still wrestling

with the notes of interrogation he had set down concerning the alleged

cheerfulness of the greeks and of greek art till at last in that

month ofpg 2 deep suspense when peace was debated at versailles he too

attained to peace with himself and slowly recovering from a disease

brought home from the field made up his mind definitely regarding the

birth of tragedy from the spirit of musicfrom music music and

tragedy greeks and tragic music greeks and the artwork of pessimism

a race of men wellfashioned beautiful envied lifeinspiring like

no other race hitherto the greeksindeed the greeks were in need

of tragedy yeaof art whereforegreek art
we can thus guess where the great note of interrogation concerning the

value of existence had been set is pessimism necessarily the sign of

decline of decay of failure of exhausted and weakened instinctsas

was the case with the indians as is to all appearance the case with

us modern men and europeans is there a pessimism of strength an

intellectual predilection for what is hard awful evil problematical

in existence owing to wellbeing to exuberant health to fullness

of existence is there perhaps suffering in overfullness itself a

seductive fortitude with the keenest of glances which yearns for

the terrible as for the enemy the worthy enemy with whom it may try

its strength from whom it is willing to learn what fear is what

means tragic myth to the greeks of the best strongest bravest era

and the prodigious phenomenon of the dionysian and that which was

born thereof tragedyand again that of which tragedy died the

socratism of morality the dialecticspg 3 contentedness and cheerfulness

of the theoretical manindeed might not this very socratism

be a sign of decline of weariness of disease of anarchically

disintegrating instincts and the hellenic cheerfulness of the later

hellenism merely a glowing sunset the epicurean will counter to

pessimism merely a precaution of the sufferer and science itself

our scienceay viewed as a symptom of life what really signifies

all science whither worse still whenceall science well is

scientism perhaps only fear and evasion of pessimism a subtle defence

againsttruth morally speaking something like falsehood and

cowardice and unmorally speaking an artifice o socrates socrates

what i then laid hands on something terrible and dangerous a

problem with horns not necessarily a bull itself but at all events

a new problem i should say today it was the problem of science

itselfscience conceived for the first time as problematic as

questionable but the book in which my youthful ardour and suspicion

then discharged themselveswhat an impossible book must needs

grow out of a task so disagreeable to youth constructed of nought

but precocious unripened selfexperiences all of which lay close

to the threshold of the communicable based on the groundwork ofpg 4
artfor the problem of science cannot be discerned on the groundwork

of sciencea book perhaps for artists with collateral analytical

and retrospective aptitudes that is an exceptional kind of artists

for whom one must seek and does not even care to seek  full of

psychological innovations and artists secrets with an artists

metaphysics in the background a work of youth full of youths mettle

and youths melancholy independent defiantly selfsufficient even

when it seems to bow to some authority and selfveneration in short

a firstlingwork even in every bad sense of the term in spite of its

senile problem affected with every fault of youth above all with

youths prolixity and youths storm and stress on the other hand

in view of the success it had especially with the great artist to

whom it addressed itself as it were in a duologue richard wagner a

demonstrated book i mean a book which at any rate sufficed for

the best of its time on this account if for no other reason it

should be treated with some consideration and reserve yet i shall not

altogether conceal how disagreeable it now appears to me how after

sixteen years it stands a total stranger before mebefore an eye

which is more mature and a hundred times more fastidious but which

has by no means grown colder nor lost any of its interest in that

selfsame task essayed for the first time by this daring bookto

view science through the optics of the artist and art moreover through

the optics of life
pg 5

i say again today it is an impossible book to mei call it badly

written heavy painful imageangling and imageentangling maudlin

sugared at times even to femininism uneven in tempo void of the will

to logical cleanliness very convinced and therefore rising above the

necessity of demonstration distrustful even of the propriety of

demonstration as being a book for initiates as music for those who

are baptised with the name of music who are united from the beginning

of things by common ties of rare experiences in art as a countersign

for bloodrelations in artibusa haughty and fantastic book

which from the very first withdraws even more from the profanum

vulgus of the cultured than from the people but which also as

its effect has shown and still shows knows very well how to seek

fellowenthusiasts and lure them to new byways and dancinggrounds

here at any ratethus much was acknowledged with curiosity as well

as with aversiona strange voice spoke the disciple of a still

unknown god who for the time being had hidden himself under the

hood of the scholar under the germans gravity and disinclination for

dialectics even under the bad manners of the wagnerian here was a

spirit with strange and still nameless needs a memory bristling with

questions experiences and obscurities beside which stood the name

dionysos like one more note of interrogation here spokepeople said

to themselves with misgivingspg 6 something like a mystic and almost

mnadic soul which undecided whether it should disclose or conceal

itself stammers with an effort and capriciously as in a strange

tongue it should have sung this new souland not spoken what

a pity that i did not dare to say what i then had to say as a poet

i could have done so perhaps or at least as a philologistfor even

at the present day wellnigh everything in this domain remains to be

discovered and disinterred by the philologist above all the problem

that here there is a problem before usand that so long as we

have no answer to the question what is dionysian the greeks are now

as ever wholly unknown and inconceivable
4
ay what is dionysianin this book may be found an answera

knowing one speaks here the votary and disciple of his god

perhaps i should now speak more guardedly and less eloquently of a

psychological question so difficult as the origin of tragedy among the

greeks a fundamental question is the relation of the greek to pain

his degree of sensibilitydid this relation remain constant or did

it veer aboutthe question whether his everincreasing longing

for beauty for festivals gaieties new cults did really grow out

of want privation melancholy pain for suppose even this to be

trueand pericles or thucydides intimates as much in the great

funeral speechwhence then the oppositepg 7 longing which appeared

first in the order of time the longing for the ugly the good

resolute desire of the old hellene for pessimism for tragic myth for

the picture of all that is terrible evil enigmatical destructive

fatal at the basis of existencewhence then must tragedy have

sprung perhaps from joy from strength from exuberant health from

overfullness and what then physiologically speaking is the meaning

of that madness out of which comic as well as tragic art has grown

the dionysian madness what perhaps madness is not necessarily the

symptom of degeneration of decline of belated culture perhaps there

area question for alienistsneuroses of health of folkyouth

and youthfulness what does that synthesis of god and goat in the

satyr point to what selfexperience what stress made the greek

think of the dionysian reveller and primitive man as a satyr and as

regards the origin of the tragic chorus perhaps there were endemic

ecstasies in the eras when the greek body bloomed and the greek soul

brimmed over with life visions and hallucinations which took hold

of entire communities entire cultassemblies what if the greeks

in the very wealth of their youth had the will to be tragic and

were pessimists what if it was madness itself to use a word of

platos which brought the greatest blessings upon hellas and

what if on the other hand and conversely at the very time of their

dissolution and weakness the greeks became always more optimistic

more superficial more histrionic also more ardent for logic and

thepg 8 logicising of the worldconsequently at the same time more

cheerful and more scientific ay despite all modern ideas and

prejudices of the democratic taste may not the triumph of optimism

the common sense that has gained the upper hand the practical and

theoretical utilitarianism like democracy itself with which it is

synchronousbe symptomatic of declining vigour of approaching age

of physiological weariness and not at allpessimism was epicurus

an optimistbecause a sufferer we see it is a whole bundle of

weighty questions which this book has taken upon itselflet us not

fail to add its weightiest question viewed through the optics of

life what is the meaning ofmorality
5
already in the foreword to richard wagner artand not moralityis

set down as the properly metaphysical activity of man in the

book itself the piquant proposition recurs time and again that the

existence of the world is justified only as an sthetic phenomenon

indeed the entire book recognises only an artistthought and

artistafterthought behind all occurrencesa god if you will

but certainly only an altogether thoughtless and unmoral artistgod

who in construction as in destruction in good as in evil desires

to become conscious of his own equable joy and sovereign glory who

in creating worlds frees himself from the anguish of fullness

and overfullness from the suffering of the contradictionspg 9

concentrated within him the world that is the redemption of god

attained at every moment as the perpetually changing perpetually

new vision of the most suffering most antithetical most contradictory

being who contrives to redeem himself only in appearance this

entire artistmetaphysics call it arbitrary idle fantastic if

you willthe point is that it already betrays a spirit which is

determined some day at all hazards to make a stand against the

moral interpretation and significance of life here perhaps for the

first time a pessimism beyond good and evil announces itself here

that perverseness of disposition obtains expression and formulation

against which schopenhauer never grew tired of hurling beforehand his

angriest imprecations and thunderboltsa philosophy which dares to

put derogatorily put morality itself in the world of phenomena and

not only among phenomena in the sense of the idealistic terminus

technicus but among the illusions as appearance semblance

error interpretation accommodation art perhaps the depth of this

antimoral tendency may be best estimated from the guarded and

hostile silence with which christianity is treated throughout this

bookchristianity as being the most extravagant burlesque of the

moral theme to which mankind has hitherto been obliged to listen in

fact to the purely sthetic worldinterpretation and justification

taught in this book there is no greater antithesis than the christian

dogma which is only and will be only moral and which with

its absolute standards for instance its truthfulnesspg 10 of god

relegatesthat is disowns convicts condemnsart all art to

the realm of falsehood behind such a mode of thought and valuation

which if at all genuine must be hostile to art i always experienced

what was hostile to life the wrathful vindictive counterwill to

life itself for all life rests on appearance art illusion optics

necessity of perspective and error from the very first christianity

was essentially and thoroughly the nausea and surfeit of life for

life which only disguised concealed and decked itself out under the

belief in another or better life the hatred of the world the

curse on the affections the fear of beauty and sensuality another

world invented for the purpose of slandering this world the more

at bottom a longing for nothingness for the end for rest for the

sabbath of sabbathsall this as also the unconditional will of

christianity to recognise only moral values has always appeared to

me as the most dangerous and ominous of all possible forms of a will

to perish at the least as the symptom of a most fatal disease of

profoundest weariness despondency exhaustion impoverishment of

lifefor before the tribunal of morality especially christian that

is unconditional morality life must constantly and inevitably be

the loser because life is something essentially unmoralindeed

oppressed with the weight of contempt and the everlasting no life

must finally be regarded as unworthy of desire as in itself

unworthy morality itself whatmay not morality be a will to

disown life a secret instinct for annihilation a principlepg 11 of

decay of depreciation of slander a beginning of the end and

consequently the danger of dangers it was against morality

therefore that my instinct as an intercessoryinstinct for life

turned in this questionable book inventing for itself a fundamental

counterdogma and countervaluation of life purely artistic purely

antichristian what should i call it as a philologist and man of

words i baptised it not without some libertyfor who could be sure

of the proper name of the antichristwith the name of a greek god i

called it dionysian
6
you see which problem i ventured to touch upon in this early work

how i now regret that i had not then the courage or immodesty to

allow myself in all respects the use of an individual language

for such individual contemplations and ventures in the field of

thoughtthat i laboured to express in kantian and schopenhauerian

formul strange and new valuations which ran fundamentally counter

to the spirit of kant and schopenhauer as well as to their taste

what forsooth were schopenhauers views on tragedy what giveshe

says in welt als wille und vorstellung ii 495to all tragedy

that singular swing towards elevation is the awakening of the

knowledge that the world that life cannot satisfy us thoroughly

and consequently is not worthy of our attachment in this consists

the tragic spirit it therefore leads to resignation oh howpg 12

differently dionysos spoke to me oh how far from me then was just

this entire resignationismbut there is something far worse in this

book which i now regret even more than having obscured and spoiled

dionysian anticipations with schopenhauerian formul to wit that in

general i spoiled the grand hellenic problem as it had opened

up before me by the admixture of the most modern things that i

entertained hopes where nothing was to be hoped for where everything

pointed alltooclearly to an approaching end that on the basis of

our latterday german music i began to fable about the spirit of

teutonism as if it were on the point of discovering and returning

to itselfay at the very time that the german spirit which not so

very long before had had the will to the lordship over europe the

strength to lead and govern europe testamentarily and conclusively

resigned and under the pompous pretence of empirefounding

effected its transition to mediocritisation democracy and modern

ideas in very fact i have since learned to regard this spirit of

teutonism as something to be despaired of and unsparingly treated

as also our present german music which is romanticism through and

through and the most ungrecian of all possible forms of art and

moreover a firstrate nervedestroyer doubly dangerous for a people

given to drinking and revering the unclear as a virtue namely in

its twofold capacity of an intoxicating and stupefying narcotic of

course apart from all precipitate hopes and faulty applicationspg 13 to

matters specially modern with which i then spoiled my first book the

great dionysian note of interrogation as set down therein continues

standing on and on even with reference to music how must we conceive

of a music which is no longer of romantic origin like the german but

of dionysian
7
but my dear sir if your book is not romanticism what in

the world is can the deep hatred of the present of reality

and modern ideas be pushed farther than has been done in your

artistmetaphysicswhich would rather believe in nothing or in

the devil than in the now does not a radical bass of wrath and

annihilative pleasure growl on beneath all your contrapuntal vocal

art and aural seduction a mad determination to oppose all that now

is a will which is not so very far removed from practical nihilism

and which seems to say rather let nothing be true than that you

should be in the right than that your truth should prevail

hear yourself my dear sir pessimist and artdeifier with ever

so unlocked ears a single select passage of your own book that

not ineloquent dragonslayer passage which may sound insidiously

ratcharming to young ears and hearts what is not that the true

blue romanticistconfession of 1830 under the mask of the pessimism

of 1850 after which of course the usual romanticist finale at once

strikes uprupture collapse return and prostration before an old

belief before the old godpg 14 what is not your pessimist book

itself a piece of antihellenism and romanticism something equally

intoxicating and befogging a narcotic at all events ay a piece of

music of german music but listen

let us imagine a rising generation with this undauntedness

of vision with this heroic impulse towards the prodigious

let us imagine the bold step of these dragonslayers

the proud daring with which they turn their backs on all

the effeminate doctrines of optimism in order to live

resolutely in the whole and in the full would it not be

necessary for the tragic man of this culture with his

selfdiscipline to earnestness and terror to desire a new

art the art of metaphysical comfort tragedy as the

helena belonging to him and that he should exclaim with

faust


und sollt ich nicht sehnschtigster gewalt

ins leben ziehn die einzigste gestalt1


would it not be necessary  no thrice no ye young

romanticists it would not be necessary but it is very probable

that things may end thus that ye may end thus namely comforted

as it is written in spite of all selfdiscipline to earnestness and

terror metaphysically comforted in short as romanticists are wont to

end as christians no ye should first of all learn the art of

earthly comfort ye should learn to laugh my young friends if ye

are at all determined to remain pessimists if so youpg 15 will perhaps

as laughing ones eventually send all metaphysical comfortism to the

deviland metaphysics first of all or to say it in the language of

that dionysian ogre called zarathustra

 foreword to richard wagner
in order to keep at a distance all the possible scruples excitements

and misunderstandings to which the thoughts gathered in this essay

will give occasion considering the peculiar character of our sthetic

publicity and to be able also co write the introductory remarks

with the same contemplative delight the impress of which as the

petrifaction of good and elevating hours it bears on every page i

form a conception of the moment when you my highly honoured friend

will receive this essay how you say after an evening walk in the

winter snow will behold the unbound prometheus on the titlepage

read my name and be forthwith convinced that whatever this essay may

contain the author has something earnest and impressive to say and

moreover that in all his meditations he communed with you as with one

present and could thus write only what befitted your presence you

will thus remember that it was at the same time as your magnificent

dissertation on beethoven originated viz amidstpg 20 the horrors and

sublimities of the war which had just then broken out that i collected

myself for these thoughts but those persons would err to whom this

collection suggests no more perhaps than the antithesis of patriotic

excitement and sthetic revelry of gallant earnestness and sportive

delight upon a real perusal of this essay such readers will rather

to their surprise discover how earnest is the german problem we have

to deal with which we properly place as a vortex and turningpoint

in the very midst of german hopes perhaps however this same class

of readers will be shocked at seeing an sthetic problem taken so

seriously especially if they can recognise in art no more than a merry

diversion a readily dispensable courtjester to the earnestness

of existence as if no one were aware of the real meaning of this

confrontation with the earnestness of existence these earnest ones

may be informed that i am convinced that art is the highest task and

the properly metaphysical activity of this life as it is understood by

the man to whom as my sublime protagonist on this path i would now

dedicate this essay
basel end of the year 1871

pg 21
 the birth of tragedy
1
we shall have gained much for the science of sthetics when once we

have perceived not only by logical inference but by the immediate

certainty of intuition that the continuous development of art is bound

up with the duplexity of the apollonian and the dionysian in

like manner as procreation is dependent on the duality of the sexes

involving perpetual conflicts with only periodically intervening

reconciliations these names we borrow from the greeks who disclose

to the intelligent observer the profound mysteries of their view of

art not indeed in concepts but in the impressively clear figures of

their world of deities it is in connection with apollo and dionysus

the two artdeities of the greeks that we learn that there existed in

the grecian world a wide antithesis in origin and aims between the

art of the shaper the apollonian and the nonplastic art of music

that of dionysus both these so heterogeneous tendencies run parallel

to each other for the most part openly at variance and continually

inciting each other to new and more powerful births to perpetuate inpg 22

them the strife of this antithesis which is but seemingly bridged over

by their mutual term art till at last by a metaphysical miracle

of the hellenic will they appear paired with each other and through

this pairing eventually generate the equally dionysian and apollonian

artwork of attic tragedy
in order to bring these two tendencies within closer range let us

conceive them first of all as the separate artworlds of dreamland

and drunkenness between which physiological phenomena a contrast

may be observed analogous to that existing between the apollonian and

the dionysian in dreams according to the conception of lucretius

the glorious divine figures first appeared to the souls of men in

dreams the great shaper beheld the charming corporeal structure of

superhuman beings and the hellenic poet if consulted on the mysteries

of poetic inspiration would likewise have suggested dreams and would

have offered an explanation resembling that of hans sachs in the

meistersingers


mein freund das grad ist dichters werk

dass er sein trumen deut und merk

glaubt mir des menschen wahrster wahn

wird ihm im traume aufgethan

all dichtkunst und poeterei

ist nichts als wahrtraumdeuterei1

pg 23
the beauteous appearance of the dreamworlds in the production of

which every man is a perfect artist is the presupposition of all

plastic art and in fact as we shall see of an important half of

poetry also we take delight in the immediate apprehension of form all

forms speak to us there is nothing indifferent nothing superfluous

but together with the highest life of this dreamreality we also have

glimmering through it the sensation of its appearance such at least

is my experience as to the frequency ay normality of which i could

adduce many proofs as also the sayings of the poets indeed the man

of philosophic turn has a foreboding that underneath this reality in

which we live and have our being another and altogether different

reality lies concealed and that therefore it is also an appearance

and schopenhauer actually designates the gift of occasionally regarding

men and things as mere phantoms and dreampictures as the criterion of

philosophical ability accordingly the man susceptible to art stands

in the same relation to the reality of dreams as the philosopher to

the reality of existence he is a close and willing observer for from

these pictures he reads the meaning of life and by these processes

he trains himself for life and it is perhaps not only the agreeable

and friendly pictures that he realises in himself with such perfect

understanding the earnest the troubled the dreary the gloomy the

sudden checks the tricks of fortune the uneasy presentiments in

short the whole divine comedy of life and the inferno also pass

before him not merely likepg 24 pictures on the wallfor he too lives and

suffers in these scenesand yet not without that fleeting sensation

of appearance and perhaps many a one will like myself recollect

having sometimes called out cheeringly and not without success amid the

dangers and terrors of dreamlife it is a dream i will dream on i

have likewise been told of persons capable of continuing the causality

of one and the same dream for three and even more successive nights

all of which facts clearly testify that our innermost being the common

substratum of all of us experiences our dreams with deep joy and

cheerful acquiescence
this cheerful acquiescence in the dreamexperience has likewise been

embodied by the greeks in their apollo for apollo as the god of

all shaping energies is also the soothsaying god he who as the

etymology of the name indicates is the shining one the deity of

light also rules over the fair appearance of the inner world of

fantasies the higher truth the perfection of these states in contrast

to the only partially intelligible everyday world ay the deep

consciousness of nature healing and helping in sleep and dream is at

the same time the symbolical analogue of the faculty of soothsaying

and in general of the arts through which life is made possible and

worth living but also that delicate line which the dreampicture must

not oversteplest it act pathologically in which case appearance

being reality pure and simple would impose upon usmust not be

wanting in the picture of apollo that measured limitation that

freedompg 25 from the wilder emotions that philosophical calmness of the

sculptorgod his eye must be sunlike according to his origin even

when it is angry and looks displeased the sacredness of his beauteous

appearance is still there and so we might apply to apollo in an

eccentric sense what schopenhauer says of the man wrapt in the veil

of my2 welt als wille und vorstellung i p 416 just as in

a stormy sea unbounded in every direction rising and falling with

howling mountainous waves a sailor sits in a boat and trusts in his

frail barque so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual sits

quietly supported by and trusting in his principium individuationis

indeed we might say of apollo that in him the unshaken faith in

this principium and the quiet sitting of the man wrapt therein have

received their sublimest expression and we might even designate apollo

as the glorious divine image of the principium individuationis

from out of the gestures and looks of which all the joy and wisdom of

appearance together with its beauty speak to us
in the same work schopenhauer has described to us the stupendous awe

which seizes upon man when of a sudden he is at a loss to account for

the cognitive forms of a phenomenon in that the principle of reason

in some one of its manifestations seems to admit of an exception

add to this awe the blissful ecstasy which rises from thepg 26 innermost

depths of man ay of nature at this same collapse of the principium

individuationis and we shall gain an insight into the being of

the dionysian which is brought within closest ken perhaps by the

analogy of drunkenness it is either under the influence of the

narcotic draught of which the hymns of all primitive men and peoples

tell us or by the powerful approach of spring penetrating all nature

with joy that those dionysian emotions awake in the augmentation of

which the subjective vanishes to complete selfforgetfulness so also

in the german middle ages singing and dancing crowds ever increasing

in number were borne from place to place under this same dionysian

power in these st johns and st vituss dancers we again perceive

the bacchic choruses of the greeks with their previous history in asia

minor as far back as babylon and the orgiastic saca there are some

who from lack of experience or obtuseness will turn away from such

phenomena as folkdiseases with a smile of contempt or pity prompted

by the consciousness of their own health of course the poor wretches

do not divine what a cadaverouslooking and ghastly aspect this very

health of theirs presents when the glowing life of the dionysian

revellers rushes past them
under the charm of the dionysian not only is the covenant between man

and man again established but also estranged hostile or subjugated

nature again celebrates her reconciliation with her lost son man of

her own accord earth proffers her gifts and peacefully the beasts ofpg 27

prey approach from the desert and the rocks the chariot of dionysus is

bedecked with flowers and garlands panthers and tigers pass beneath

his yoke change beethovens jubileesong into a painting and if

your imagination be equal to the occasion when the awestruck millions

sink into the dust you will then be able to approach the dionysian

now is the slave a free man now all the stubborn hostile barriers

which necessity caprice or shameless fashion has set up between

man and man are broken down now at the evangel of cosmic harmony

each one feels himself not only united reconciled blended with

his neighbour but as one with him as if the veil of my has been

torn and were now merely fluttering in tatters before the mysterious

primordial unity in song and in dance man exhibits himself as a member

of a higher community he has forgotten how to walk and speak and

is on the point of taking a dancing flight into the air his gestures

bespeak enchantment even as the animals now talk and as the earth

yields milk and honey so also something supernatural sounds forth

from him he feels himself a god he himself now walks about enchanted

and elated even as the gods whom he saw walking about in his dreams

man is no longer an artist he has become a work of art the artistic

power of all nature here reveals itself in the tremors of drunkenness

to the highest gratification of the primordial unity the noblest clay

the costliest marble namely man is here kneaded and cut and the

chisel strokes ofpg 28 the dionysian worldartist are accompanied with the

thus far we have considered the apollonian and his antithesis

the dionysian as artistic powers which burst forth from nature

herself without the mediation of the human artist and in which

her artimpulses are satisfied in the most immediate and direct way

first as the pictorial world of dreams the perfection of which

has no connection whatever with the intellectual height or artistic

culture of the unit man and again as drunken reality which likewise

does not heed the unit man but even seeks to destroy the individual

and redeem him by a mystic feeling of oneness anent these immediate

artstates of nature every artist is either an imitator to wit

either an apollonian an artist in dreams or a dionysian an artist

in ecstasies or finallyas for instance in greek tragedyan artist

in both dreams and ecstasies so we may perhaps picture him as in

his dionysian drunkenness and mystical selfabnegation lonesome and

apart from the revelling choruses he sinks down and how now through

apollonian dreaminspiration his own state iepg 29 his oneness

with the primal source of the universe reveals itself to him in a

symbolical dreampicture
after these general premisings and contrastings let us now approach

the greeks in order to learn in what degree and to what height

these artimpulses of nature were developed in them whereby

we shall be enabled to understand and appreciate more deeply the

relation of the greek artist to his archetypes or according to the

aristotelian expression the imitation of nature in spite of all the

dreamliterature and the numerous dreamanecdotes of the greeks we can

speak only conjecturally though with a fair degree of certainty of

their dreams considering the incredibly precise and unerring plastic

power of their eyes as also their manifest and sincere delight in

colours we can hardly refrain to the shame of every one born later

from assuming for their very dreams a logical causality of lines and

contours colours and groups a sequence of scenes resembling their

best reliefs the perfection of which would certainly justify us if a

comparison were possible in designating the dreaming greeks as homers

and homer as a dreaming greek in a deeper sense than when modern man

in respect to his dreams ventures to compare himself with shakespeare
on the other hand we should not have to speak conjecturally if asked

to disclose the immense gap which separated the dionysian greek from

the dionysian barbarian from all quarters of the ancient worldto

say nothing of the modernfrom rome as far as babylon we canpg 30 prove

the existence of dionysian festivals the type of which bears at

best the same relation to the greek festivals as the bearded satyr

who borrowed his name and attributes from the goat does to dionysus

himself in nearly every instance the centre of these festivals lay

in extravagant sexual licentiousness the waves of which overwhelmed

all family life and its venerable traditions the very wildest beasts

of nature were let loose here including that detestable mixture of

lust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the genuine witches

draught for some time however it would seem that the greeks

were perfectly secure and guarded against the feverish agitations

of these festivals the knowledge of which entered greece by all

the channels of land and sea by the figure of apollo himself rising

here in full pride who could not have held out the gorgons head to

a more dangerous power than this grotesquely uncouth dionysian it

is in doric art that this majesticallyrejecting attitude of apollo

perpetuated itself this opposition became more precarious and even

impossible when from out of the deepest root of the hellenic nature

similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves

the delphic god by a seasonably effected reconciliation was now

contented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of his

powerful antagonist this reconciliation marks the most important

moment in the history of the greek cult wherever we turn our eyes

we may observe the revolutions resulting from this event it was

the reconciliation of two antagonistspg 31 with the sharp demarcation

of the boundarylines to be thenceforth observed by each and with

periodical transmission of testimonialsin reality the chasm was

not bridged over but if we observe how under the pressure of this

conclusion of peace the dionysian power manifested itself we shall

now recognise in the dionysian orgies of the greeks as compared with

the babylonian saca and their retrogression of man to the tiger and

the ape the significance of festivals of worldredemption and days of

transfiguration not till then does nature attain her artistic jubilee

not till then does the rupture of the principium individuationis

become an artistic phenomenon that horrible witches draught of

sensuality and cruelty was here powerless only the curious blending

and duality in the emotions of the dionysian revellers reminds one of

itjust as medicines remind one of deadly poisonsthat phenomenon

to wit that pains beget joy that jubilation wrings painful sounds out

of the breast from the highest joy sounds the cry of horror or the

yearning wail over an irretrievable loss in these greek festivals a

sentimental trait as it were breaks forth from nature as if she must

sigh over her dismemberment into individuals the song and pantomime

of such duallyminded revellers was something new and unheardof in

the homericgrecian world and the dionysian music in particular

excited awe and horror if music as it would seem was previously

known as an apollonian art it was strictly speaking only as the

wavebeat of rhythm the formative power ofpg 32 which was developed to

the representation of apollonian conditions the music of apollo was

doric architectonics in tones but in merely suggested tones such

as those of the cithara the very element which forms the essence of

dionysian music and hence of music in general is carefully excluded

as unapollonian namely the thrilling power of the tone the uniform

stream of the melos and the thoroughly incomparable world of harmony

in the dionysian dithyramb man is incited to the highest exaltation

of all his symbolic faculties something never before experienced

struggles for utterancethe annihilation of the veil of my oneness

as genius of the race ay of nature the essence of nature is now

to be expressed symbolically a new world of symbols is required

for once the entire symbolism of the body not only the symbolism of

the lips face and speech but the whole pantomime of dancing which

sets all the members into rhythmical motion thereupon the other

symbolic powers those of music in rhythmics dynamics and harmony

suddenly become impetuous to comprehend this collective discharge

of all the symbolic powers a man must have already attained that

height of selfabnegation which wills to express itself symbolically

through these powers the dithyrambic votary of dionysus is therefore

understood only by those like himself with what astonishment must the

apollonian greek have beheld him with an astonishment which was all

the greater the more it was mingled with the shuddering suspicion that

all this was inpg 33 reality not so very foreign to him yea that like

unto a veil his apollonian consciousness only hid this dionysian world

from his view
3
in order to comprehend this we must take down the artistic structure

of the apollonian culture as it were stone by stone till we behold

the foundations on which it rests here we observe first of all the

glorious olympian figures of the gods standing on the gables of this

structure whose deeds represented in farshining reliefs adorn its

friezes though apollo stands among them as an individual deity side

by side with others and without claim to priority of rank we must not

suffer this fact to mislead us the same impulse which embodied itself

in apollo has in general given birth to this whole olympian world

and in this sense we may regard apollo as the father thereof what was

the enormous need from which proceeded such an illustrious group of

olympian beings
whosoever with another religion in his heart approaches these

olympians and seeks among them for moral elevation even for sanctity

for incorporeal spiritualisation for sympathetic looks of love will

soon be obliged to turn his back on them discouraged and disappointed

here nothing suggests asceticism spirituality or duty here only

an exuberant even triumphant life speaks to us in which everything

existing is deified whether good or bad and so thepg 34 spectator will

perhaps stand quite bewildered before this fantastic exuberance of

life and ask himself what magic potion these madly merry men could

have used for enjoying life so that wherever they turned their eyes

helena the ideal image of their own existence floating in sweet

sensuality smiled upon them but to this spectator already turning

backwards we must call out depart not hence but hear rather what

greek folkwisdom says of this same life which with such inexplicable

cheerfulness spreads out before thee there is an ancient story that

king midas hunted in the forest a long time for the wise silenus

the companion of dionysus without capturing him when at last he fell

into his hands the king asked what was best of all and most desirable

for man fixed and immovable the demon remained silent till at last

forced by the king he broke out with shrill laughter into these words

oh wretched race of a day children of chance and misery why do ye

compel me to say to you what it were most expedient for you not to

hear what is best of all is for ever beyond your reach not to be

born not to be to be nothing the second best for you however

is soon to die
how is the olympian world of deities related to this folkwisdom even

as the rapturous vision of the tortured martyr to his sufferings
now the olympian magic mountain opens as it were to our view and

shows to us its roots the greek knew and felt the terrors and horrors

of existence to be able to live at all he had topg 35 interpose the

shining dreambirth of the olympian world between himself and them

the excessive distrust of the titanic powers of nature the moira

throning inexorably over all knowledge the vulture of the great

philanthropist prometheus the terrible fate of the wise dipus the

family curse of the atrid which drove orestes to matricide in short

that entire philosophy of the sylvan god with its mythical exemplars

which wrought the ruin of the melancholy etruscanswas again and again

surmounted anew by the greeks through the artistic middle world of

the olympians or at least veiled and withdrawn from sight to be able

to live the greeks had from direst necessity to create these gods

which process we may perhaps picture to ourselves in this manner that

out of the original titan thearchy of terror the olympian thearchy of

joy was evolved by slow transitions through the apollonian impulse to

beauty even as roses break forth from thorny bushes how else could

this so sensitive people so vehement in its desires so singularly

qualified for sufferings have endured existence if it had not been

exhibited to them in their gods surrounded with a higher glory

the same impulse which calls art into being as the complement and

consummation of existence seducing to a continuation of life caused

also the olympian world to arise in which the hellenic will held

up before itself a transfiguring mirror thus do the gods justify the

life of man in that they themselves live itthe only satisfactory

theodicy existence under the bright sunshinepg 36 of such gods is regarded

as that which is desirable in itself and the real grief of the

homeric men has reference to parting from it especially to early

parting so that we might now say of them with a reversion of the

silenian wisdom that to die early is worst of all for them the

second worst issome day to die at all if once the lamentation is

heard it will ring out again of the shortlived achilles of the

leaflike change and vicissitude of the human race of the decay of

the heroic age it is not unworthy of the greatest hero to long for a

continuation of life ay even as a daylabourer so vehemently does

the will at the apollonian stage of development long for this

existence so completely at one does the homeric man feel himself with

it that the very lamentation becomes its song of praise
here we must observe that this harmony which is so eagerly contemplated

by modern man in fact this oneness of man with nature to express

which schiller introduced the technical term nave is by no means

such a simple naturally resulting and as it were inevitable

condition which must be found at the gate of every culture leading

to a paradise of man this could be believed only by an age which

sought to picture to itself rousseaus mile also as an artist

and imagined it had found in homer such an artist mile reared at

natures bosom wherever we meet with the nave in art it behoves

us to recognise the highest effect of the apollonian culture which

in the first place has always to overthrow some titanic empire and

slay monsters andpg 37 which through powerful dazzling representations

and pleasurable illusions must have triumphed over a terrible depth

of worldcontemplation and a most keen susceptibility to suffering

but how seldom is the navethat complete absorption in the beauty

of appearanceattained and hence how inexpressibly sublime is

homer who as unit being bears the same relation to this apollonian

folkculture as the unit dreamartist does to the dreamfaculty of

the people and of nature in general the homeric navet can be

comprehended only as the complete triumph of the apollonian illusion

it is the same kind of illusion as nature so frequently employs to

compass her ends the true goal is veiled by a phantasm we stretch out

our hands for the latter while nature attains the former through our

illusion in the greeks the will desired to contemplate itself in the

transfiguration of the genius and the world of art in order to glorify

themselves its creatures had to feel themselves worthy of glory

they had to behold themselves again in a higher sphere without this

consummate world of contemplation acting as an imperative or reproach

such is the sphere of beauty in which as in a mirror they saw their

images the olympians with this mirroring of beauty the hellenic will

combated its talentcorrelative to the artisticfor suffering and for

the wisdom of suffering and as a monument of its victory homer the

nave artist stands before us
pg 38

concerning this nave artist the analogy of dreams will enlighten us to

some extent when we realise to ourselves the dreamer as in the midst

of the illusion of the dreamworld and without disturbing it he calls

out to himself it is a dream i will dream on when we must thence

infer a deep inner joy in dreamcontemplation when on the other hand

to be at all able to dream with this inner joy in contemplation we

must have completely forgotten the day and its terrible obtrusiveness

we may under the direction of the dreamreading apollo interpret

all these phenomena to ourselves somewhat as follows though it is

certain that of the two halves of life the waking and the dreaming

the former appeals to us as by far the more preferred important

excellent and worthy of being lived indeed as that which alone is

lived yet with reference to that mysterious ground of our being of

which we are the phenomenon i should paradoxical as it may seem be

inclined to maintain the very opposite estimate of the value of dream

life for the more clearly i perceive in nature those allpowerful art

impulses and in them a fervent longing for appearance for redemption

through appearance the more i feel myself driven to the metaphysical

assumption that the verilyexistent and primordial unity as the

eternally suffering and selfcontradictory requires the rapturous

vision the joyful appearance for its continuous salvation which

appearance we who are completely wraptpg 39 in it and composed of it must

regard as the verily nonexistentie as a perpetual unfolding

in time space and causalityin other words as empiric reality

if we therefore waive the consideration of our own reality for the

present if we conceive our empiric existence and that of the world

generally as a representation of the primordial unity generated every

moment we shall then have to regard the dream as an appearance of

appearance hence as a still higher gratification of the primordial

desire for appearance it is for this same reason that the innermost

heart of nature experiences that indescribable joy in the nave artist

and in the nave work of art which is likewise only an appearance of

appearance in a symbolic painting raphael himself one of these

immortal nave ones has represented to us this depotentiating of

appearance to appearance the primordial process of the nave artist

and at the same time of apollonian culture in his transfiguration

the lower half with the possessed boy the despairing bearers the

helpless terrified disciples shows to us the reflection of eternal

primordial pain the sole basis of the world the appearance here

is the counterappearance of eternal contradiction the father of

things out of this appearance then arises like an ambrosial vapour a

visionlike new world of appearances of which those wrapt in the first

appearance see nothinga radiant floating in purest bliss and painless

contemplation beaming from wideopen eyes here there is presented to

our view in the highest symbolism of art that apollonian world of

beauty and its substratumpg 40 the terrible wisdom of silenus and we

comprehend by intuition their necessary interdependence apollo

however again appears to us as the apotheosis of the principium

individuationis in which alone the perpetually attained end of the

primordial unity its redemption through appearance is consummated he

shows us with sublime attitudes how the entire world of torment is

necessary that thereby the individual may be impelled to realise the

redeeming vision and then sunk in contemplation thereof quietly sit

in his fluctuating barque in the midst of the sea
this apotheosis of individuation if it be at all conceived as

imperative and laying down precepts knows but one lawthe individual

ie the observance of the boundaries of the individual

measure in the hellenic sense apollo as ethical deity demands

due proportion of his disciples and that this may be observed he

demands selfknowledge and thus parallel to the sthetic necessity

for beauty there run the demands know thyself and not too much

while presumption and undueness are regarded as the truly hostile

demons of the nonapollonian sphere hence as characteristics of the

preapollonian age that of the titans and of the extraapollonian

world that of the barbarians because of his titanlike love for

man prometheus had to be torn to pieces by vultures because of his

excessive wisdom which solved the riddle of the sphinx dipus had

to plunge into a bewildering vortex of monstrous crimes thus did the

delphic god interpret the grecian past
pg 41
so also the effects wrought by the dionysian appeared titanic and

barbaric to the apollonian greek while at the same time he could

not conceal from himself that he too was inwardly related to these

overthrown titans and heroes indeed he had to recognise still more

than this his entire existence with all its beauty and moderation

rested on a hidden substratum of suffering and of knowledge which

was again disclosed to him by the dionysian and lo apollo could not

live without dionysus the titanic and the barbaric were in the

end not less necessary than the apollonian and now let us imagine to

ourselves how the ecstatic tone of the dionysian festival sounded in

ever more luring and bewitching strains into this artificially confined

world built on appearance and moderation how in these strains all

the undueness of nature in joy sorrow and knowledge even to

the transpiercing shriek became audible let us ask ourselves what

meaning could be attached to the psalmodising artist of apollo with

the phantom harpsound as compared with this demonic folksong the

muses of the arts of appearance paled before an art which in its

intoxication spoke the truth the wisdom of silenus cried woe woe

against the cheerful olympians the individual with all his boundaries

and due proportions went under in the selfoblivion of the dionysian

states and forgot the apollonian precepts the undueness revealed

itself as truth contradiction the bliss born of pain declared itself

but of the heart of nature and thus wherever the dionysian prevailed

the apollonian waspg 42 routed and annihilated but it is quite as certain

that where the first assault was successfully withstood the authority

and majesty of the delphic god exhibited itself as more rigid and

menacing than ever for i can only explain to myself the doric state

and doric art as a permanent warcamp of the apollonian only by

incessant opposition to the titanicbarbaric nature of the dionysian

was it possible for an art so defiantlyprim so encompassed with

bulwarks a training so warlike and rigorous a constitution so cruel

and relentless to last for any length of time
up to this point we have enlarged upon the observation made at the

beginning of this essay how the dionysian and the apollonian in ever

new births succeeding and mutually augmenting one another controlled

the hellenic genius how from out the age of bronze with its titan

struggles and rigorous folkphilosophy the homeric world develops

under the fostering sway of the apollonian impulse to beauty how this

nave splendour is again overwhelmed by the inbursting flood of the

dionysian and how against this new power the apollonian rises to the

austere majesty of doric art and the doric view of things if then

in this way in the strife of these two hostile principles the older

hellenic history falls into four great periods of art we are now

driven to inquire after the ulterior purpose of these unfoldings and

processes unless perchance we should regard the lastattained period

the period of doric art as the end and aim of these artistic impulses

and here the sublime and highly celebrated artwork ofpg 43 attic tragedy

and dramatic dithyramb presents itself to our view as the common

goal of both these impulses whose mysterious union after many and

long precursory struggles found its glorious consummation in such a

childwhich is at once antigone and cassandra
5
we now approach the real purpose of our investigation which aims

at acquiring a knowledge of the dionysoapollonian genius and his

artwork or at least an anticipatory understanding of the mystery of

the aforesaid union here we shall ask first of all where that new

germ which subsequently developed into tragedy and dramatic dithyramb

first makes itself perceptible in the hellenic world the ancients

themselves supply the answer in symbolic form when they place homer

and archilochus as the forefathers and torchbearers of greek poetry

side by side on gems sculptures etc in the sure conviction that

only these two thoroughly original compeers from whom a stream of

fire flows over the whole of greek posterity should be taken into

consideration homer the aged dreamer sunk in himself the type

of the apollonian nave artist beholds now with astonishment the

impassioned genius of the warlike votary of the muses archilochus

violently tossed to and fro on the billows of existence and modern

sthetics could only add by way of interpretation that here the

objective artist is confronted by the first subjective artistpg 44

but this interpretation is of little service to us because we know

the subjective artist only as the poor artist and in every type and

elevation of art we demand specially and first of all the conquest

of the subjective the redemption from the ego and the cessation

of every individual will and desire indeed we find it impossible

to believe in any truly artistic production however insignificant

without objectivity without pure interestless contemplation hence

our sthetics must first solve the problem as to how the lyrist is

possible as an artist he who according to the experience of all ages

continually says i and sings off to us the entire chromatic scale of

his passions and desires this very archilochus appals us alongside

of homer by his cries of hatred and scorn by the drunken outbursts

of his desire is not just he then who has been called the first

subjective artist the nonartist proper but whence then the reverence

which was shown to himthe poetin very remarkable utterances by the

delphic oracle itself the focus of objective art
schiller has enlightened us concerning his poetic procedure by a

psychological observation inexplicable to himself yet not apparently

open to any objection he acknowledges that as the preparatory state

to the act of poetising he had not perhaps before him or within him a

series of pictures with coordinate causality of thoughts but rather

a musical mood the perception with me is at first without a clear

and definite object this forms itself later a certain musical mood

ofpg 45 mind precedes and only after this does the poetical idea follow

with me add to this the most important phenomenon of all ancient

lyric poetry the union regarded everywhere as natural of the

lyrist with the musician their very identity indeedcompared

with which our modern lyric poetry is like the statue of a god without

a headand we may now on the basis of our metaphysics of sthetics

set forth above interpret the lyrist to ourselves as follows as

dionysian artist he is in the first place become altogether one with

the primordial unity its pain and contradiction and he produces the

copy of this primordial unity as music granting that music has been

correctly termed a repetition and a recast of the world but now under

the apollonian dreaminspiration this music again becomes visible

to him as in a symbolic dreampicture the formless and intangible

reflection of the primordial pain in music with its redemption in

appearance then generates a second mirroring as a concrete symbol or

example the artist has already surrendered his subjectivity in the

dionysian process the picture which now shows to him his oneness with

the heart of the world is a dreamscene which embodies the primordial

contradiction and primordial pain together with the primordial joy of

appearance the i of the lyrist sounds therefore from the abyss of

being its subjectivity in the sense of the modern sthetes is a

fiction when archilochus the first lyrist of the greeks makes known

both his mad love and his contempt to the daughters of lycambes it is

not his passion whichpg 46 dances before us in orgiastic frenzy we see

dionysus and the mnads we see the drunken reveller archilochus sunk

down to sleepas euripides depicts it in the bacch the sleep on the

high alpine pasture in the noonday sunand now apollo approaches and

touches him with the laurel the dionysomusical enchantment of the

sleeper now emits as it were picture sparks lyrical poems which in

their highest development are called tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs
the plastic artist as also the epic poet who is related to him is

sunk in the pure contemplation of pictures the dionysian musician

is without any picture himself just primordial pain and the

primordial reechoing thereof the lyric genius is conscious of a

world of pictures and symbolsgrowing out of the state of mystical

selfabnegation and onenesswhich has a colouring causality and

velocity quite different from that of the world of the plastic artist

and epic poet while the latter lives in these pictures and only in

them with joyful satisfaction and never grows tired of contemplating

them with love even in their minutest characters while even the

picture of the angry achilles is to him but a picture the angry

expression of which he enjoys with the dreamjoy in appearanceso

that by this mirror of appearance he is guarded against being unified

and blending with his figuresthe pictures of the lyrist on the other

hand are nothing but his very self and as it were only different

projections of himself on account of which he as the moving centre

of this world is entitled to say i onlypg 47 of course this self is

not the same as that of the waking empirically real man but the

only verily existent and eternal self resting at the basis of things

by means of the images whereof the lyric genius sees through even to

this basis of things now let us suppose that he beholds himself

also among these images as nongenius ie his subject the whole

throng of subjective passions and impulses of the will directed to a

definite object which appears real to him if now it seems as if the

lyric genius and the allied nongenius were one and as if the former

spoke that little word i of his own accord this appearance will no

longer be able to lead us astray as it certainly led those astray who

designated the lyrist as the subjective poet in truth archilochus

the passionately inflamed loving and hating man is but a vision of

the genius who by this time is no longer archilochus but a genius

of the world who expresses his primordial pain symbolically in the

figure of the man archilochus while the subjectively willing and

desiring man archilochus can never at any time be a poet it is by no

means necessary however that the lyrist should see nothing but the

phenomenon of the man archilochus before him as a reflection of eternal

being and tragedy shows how far the visionary world of the lyrist may

depart from this phenomenon to which of course it is most intimately

related
schopenhauer who did not shut his eyes to the difficulty presented

by the lyrist in the philosophical contemplation of art thought he

had found a way out of it on which however i cannotpg 48 accompany him

while he alone in his profound metaphysics of music held in his

hands the means whereby this difficulty could be definitely removed

as i believe i have removed it here in his spirit and to his honour

in contrast to our view he describes the peculiar nature of song

as follows4 welt als wille und vorstellung i 295it is

the subject of the will ie his own volition which fills the

consciousness of the singer often as an unbound and satisfied desire

joy but still more often as a restricted desire grief always as

an emotion a passion or an agitated frame of mind besides this

however and along with it by the sight of surrounding nature the

singer becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure willless

knowing the unbroken blissful peace of which now appears in contrast

to the stress of desire which is always restricted and always needy

the feeling of this contrast this alternation is really what the

song as a whole expresses and what principally constitutes the lyrical

state of mind in it pure knowing comes to us as it were to deliver us

from desire and the stress thereof we follow but only for an instant

for desire the remembrance of our personal ends tears us anew from

peaceful contemplation yet ever again the next beautiful surrounding

in which the pure willless knowledge presents itself to us allures

us away from desire therefore in song and in the lyrical mood

desirepg 49 the personal interest of the ends and the pure perception of

the surrounding which presents itself are wonderfully mingled with

each other connections between them are sought for and imagined the

subjective disposition the affection of the will imparts its own

hue to the contemplated surrounding and conversely the surroundings

communicate the reflex of their colour to the will the true song is

the expression of the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind
who could fail to see in this description that lyric poetry is here

characterised as an imperfectly attained art which seldom and only

as it were in leaps arrives at its goal indeed as a semiart the

essence of which is said to consist in this that desire and pure

contemplation ie the unsthetic and the sthetic condition are

wonderfully mingled with each other we maintain rather that this

entire antithesis according to which as according to some standard

of value schopenhauer too still classifies the arts the antithesis

between the subjective and the objective is quite out of place in

sthetics inasmuch as the subject ie the desiring individual who

furthers his own egoistic ends can be conceived only as the adversary

not as the origin of art in so far as the subject is the artist

however he has already been released from his individual will and has

become as it were the medium through which the one verily existent

subject celebrates his redemption in appearance for this one thing

must above all be clear to us to our humiliation and exaltation

that the entire comedy of art is not at all performedpg 50 say for our

betterment and culture and that we are just as little the true authors

of this artworld rather we may assume with regard to ourselves that

its true author uses us as pictures and artistic projections and that

we have our highest dignity in our significance as works of artfor

only as an sthetic phenomenon is existence and the world eternally

justifiedwhile of course our consciousness of this our specific

significance hardly differs from the kind of consciousness which the

soldiers painted on canvas have of the battle represented thereon

hence all our knowledge of art is at bottom quite illusory because as

knowing persons we are not one and identical with the being who as the

sole author and spectator of this comedy of art prepares a perpetual

entertainment for himself only in so far as the genius in the act of

artistic production coalesces with this primordial artist of the world

does he get a glimpse of the eternal essence of art for in this state

he is in a marvellous manner like the weird picture of the fairytale

which can at will turn its eyes and behold itself he is now at once

subject and object at once poet actor and spectator

with reference to archilochus it has been established by critical

research that he introduced the folksong into literature and

on account thereof deserved according to the general estimate of

the greeks his unique position alongside of homer but what is this

popular folksong inpg 51 contrast to the wholly apollonian epos what

else but the perpetuum vestigium of a union of the apollonian and

the dionysian its enormous diffusion among all peoples still further

enhanced by ever new births testifies to the power of this artistic

double impulse of nature which leaves its vestiges in the popular

song in like manner as the orgiastic movements of a people perpetuate

themselves in its music indeed one might also furnish historical

proofs that every period which is highly productive in popular songs

has been most violently stirred by dionysian currents which we must

always regard as the substratum and prerequisite of the popular song
first of all however we regard the popular song as the musical mirror

of the world as the original melody which now seeks for itself a

parallel dreamphenomenon and expresses it in poetry melody is

therefore primary and universal and as such may admit of several

objectivations in several texts likewise in the nave estimation of

the people it is regarded as by far the more important and necessary

melody generates the poem out of itself by an everrecurring process

the strophic form of the popular song points to the same phenomenon

which i always beheld with astonishment till at last i found this

explanation any one who in accordance with this theory examines a

collection of popular songs such as des knaben wunderhorn will find

innumerable instances of the perpetually productive melody scattering

picture sparks all around which in their variegation their abrupt

changepg 52 their mad precipitance manifest a power quite unknown to the

epic appearance and its steady flow from the point of view of the

epos this unequal and irregular pictorial world of lyric poetry must

be simply condemned and the solemn epic rhapsodists of the apollonian

festivals in the age of terpander have certainly done so
accordingly we observe that in the poetising of the popular song

language is strained to its utmost to imitate music and hence a

new world of poetry begins with archilochus which is fundamentally

opposed to the homeric and in saying this we have pointed out the

only possible relation between poetry and music between word and

tone the word the picture the concept here seeks an expression

analogous to music and now experiences in itself the power of music

in this sense we may discriminate between two main currents in the

history of the language of the greek people according as their

language imitated either the world of phenomena and of pictures or the

world of music one has only to reflect seriously on the linguistic

difference with regard to colour syntactical structure and vocabulary

in homer and pindar in order to comprehend the significance of this

contrast indeed it becomes palpably clear to us that in the period

between homer and pindar the orgiastic flute tones of olympus must

have sounded forth which in an age as late as aristotles when

music was infinitely more developed transported people to drunken

enthusiasm and which when their influence was first felt undoubtedly

incited all the poetic means ofpg 53 expression of contemporaneous man

to imitation i here call attention to a familiar phenomenon of our

own times against which our sthetics raises many objections we

again and again have occasion to observe how a symphony of beethoven

compels the individual hearers to use figurative speech though the

appearance presented by a collocation of the different pictorial

world generated by a piece of music may be never so fantastically

diversified and even contradictory to practise its small wit on such

compositions and to overlook a phenomenon which is certainly worth

explaining is quite in keeping with this sthetics indeed even if

the tonepoet has spoken in pictures concerning a composition when for

instance he designates a certain symphony as the pastoral symphony

or a passage therein as the scene by the brook or another as the

merry gathering of rustics these are likewise only symbolical

representations born out of musicand not perhaps the imitated objects

of musicrepresentations which can give us no information whatever

concerning the dionysian content of music and which in fact have

no distinctive value of their own alongside of other pictorical

expressions this process of a discharge of music in pictures we have

now to transfer to some youthful linguistically productive people to

get a notion as to how the strophic popular song originates and how

the entire faculty of speech is stimulated by this new principle of

imitation of music
if therefore we may regard lyric poetry as the effulguration of

music in pictures and conceptspg 54 we can now ask how does music

appear in the mirror of symbolism and conception it appears as

will taking the word in the schopenhauerian sense ie as the

antithesis of the sthetic purely contemplative and passive frame

of mind here however we must discriminate as sharply as possible

between the concept of essentiality and the concept of phenominality

for music according to its essence cannot be will because as such it

would have to be wholly banished from the domain of artfor the will

is the unstheticinitselfyet it appears as will for in order to

express the phenomenon of music in pictures the lyrist requires all

the stirrings of passion from the whispering of infant desire to the

roaring of madness under the impulse to speak of music in apollonian

symbols he conceives of all nature and himself therein only as the

eternally willing desiring longing existence but in so far as he

interprets music by means of pictures he himself rests in the quiet

calm of apollonian contemplation however much all around him which

he beholds through the medium of music is in a state of confused and

violent motion indeed when he beholds himself through this same

medium his own image appears to him in a state of unsatisfied feeling

his own willing longing moaning and rejoicing are to him symbols by

which he interprets music such is the phenomenon of the lyrist as

apollonian genius he interprets music through the image of the will

while he himself completely released from the avidity of the will is

the pure undimmed eye of day
pg 55
our whole disquisition insists on this that lyric poetry is dependent

on the spirit of music just as music itself in its absolute sovereignty

does not require the picture and the concept but only endures

them as accompaniments the poems of the lyrist can express nothing

which has not already been contained in the vast universality and

absoluteness of the music which compelled him to use figurative

speech by no means is it possible for language adequately to render

the cosmic symbolism of music for the very reason that music stands

in symbolic relation to the primordial contradiction and primordial

pain in the heart of the primordial unity and therefore symbolises a

sphere which is above all appearance and before all phenomena rather

should we say that all phenomena compared with it are but symbols

hence language as the organ and symbol of phenomena cannot at all

disclose the innermost essence of music language can only be in

superficial contact with music when it attempts to imitate music while

the profoundest significance of the latter cannot be brought one step

nearer to us by all the eloquence of lyric poetry
7
we shall now have to avail ourselves of all the principles of art

hitherto considered in order to find our way through the labyrinth

as we must designate the origin of greek tragedy i shall not be

charged with absurdity in saying that thepg 56 problem of this origin has

as yet not even been seriously stated not to say solved however

often the fluttering tatters of ancient tradition have been sewed

together in sundry combinations and torn asunder again this tradition

tells us in the most unequivocal terms that tragedy sprang from the

tragic chorus and was originally only chorus and nothing but chorus

and hence we feel it our duty to look into the heart of this tragic

chorus as being the real protodrama without in the least contenting

ourselves with current artphraseologyaccording to which the chorus

is the ideal spectator or represents the people in contrast to the

regal side of the scene the latter explanatory notion which sounds

sublime to many a politicianthat the immutable moral law was embodied

by the democratic athenians in the popular chorus which always carries

its point over the passionate excesses and extravagances of kingsmay

be ever so forcibly suggested by an observation of aristotle still

it has no bearing on the original formation of tragedy inasmuch

as the entire antithesis of king and people and in general the

whole politicosocial sphere is excluded from the purely religious

beginnings of tragedy but considering the wellknown classical

form of the chorus in schylus and sophocles we should even deem

it blasphemy to speak here of the anticipation of a constitutional

representation of the people from which blasphemy others have not

shrunk however the ancient governments knew of no constitutional

representation of the people in praxi and it is topg 57 be hoped that

they did not even so much as anticipate it in tragedy
much more celebrated than this political explanation of the chorus is

the notion of a w schlegel who advises us to regard the chorus in

a manner as the essence and extract of the crowd of spectatorsas

the ideal spectator this view when compared with the historical

tradition that tragedy was originally only chorus reveals itself

in its true character as a crude unscientific yet brilliant

assertion which however has acquired its brilliancy only through

its concentrated form of expression through the truly germanic bias

in favour of whatever is called ideal and through our momentary

astonishment for we are indeed astonished the moment we compare our

wellknown theatrical public with this chorus and ask ourselves if it

could ever be possible to idealise something analogous to the greek

chorus out of such a public we tacitly deny this and now wonder

as much at the boldness of schlegels assertion as at the totally

different nature of the greek public for hitherto we always believed

that the true spectator be he who he may had always to remain

conscious of having before him a work of art and not an empiric

reality whereas the tragic chorus of the greeks is compelled to

recognise real beings in the figures of the stage the chorus of the

oceanides really believes that it sees before it the titan prometheus

and considers itself as real as the god of the scene and are we to

own that he is the highest and purest type of spectator who like the

oceanides regards prometheus aspg 58 real and present in body and is it

characteristic of the ideal spectator that he should run on the stage

and free the god from his torments we had believed in an sthetic

public and considered the individual spectator the better qualified

the more he was capable of viewing a work of art as art that is

sthetically but now the schlegelian expression has intimated to us

that the perfect ideal spectator does not at all suffer the world of

the scenes to act sthetically on him but corporeoempirically oh

these greeks we have sighed they will upset our sthetics but once

accustomed to it we have reiterated the saying of schlegel as often

as the subject of the chorus has been broached
but the tradition which is so explicit here speaks against schlegel

the chorus as such without the stagethe primitive form of

tragedyand the chorus of ideal spectators do not harmonise what

kind of art would that be which was extracted from the concept of the

spectator and whereof we are to regard the spectator as such as the

true form the spectator without the play is something absurd we fear

that the birth of tragedy can be explained neither by the high esteem

for the moral intelligence of the multitude nor by the concept of the

spectator without the play and we regard the problem as too deep to be

even so much as touched by such superficial modes of contemplation
an infinitely more valuable insight into the signification of the

chorus had already been displayed by schiller in the celebrated preface

to hispg 59 bride of messina where he regarded the chorus as a living wall

which tragedy draws round herself to guard her from contact with the

world of reality and to preserve her ideal domain and poetical freedom
it is with this his chief weapon that schiller combats the ordinary

conception of the natural the illusion ordinarily required in

dramatic poetry he contends that while indeed the day on the stage is

merely artificial the architecture only symbolical and the metrical

dialogue purely ideal in character nevertheless an erroneous view

still prevails in the main that it is not enough to tolerate merely

as a poetical license that which is in reality the essence of all

poetry the introduction of the chorus is he says the decisive step

by which war is declared openly and honestly against all naturalism

in artit is methinks for disparaging this mode of contemplation

that our wouldbe superior age has coined the disdainful catchword

pseudoidealism i fear however that we on the other hand with our

present worship of the natural and the real have landed at the nadir

of all idealism namely in the region of cabinets of waxfigures an

art indeed exists also here as in certain novels much in vogue at

present but let no one pester us with the claim that by this art the

schillergoethian pseudoidealism has been vanquished
it is indeed an ideal domain as schiller rightly perceived

uponwhich the greek satyric chorus the chorus of primitive tragedy

was wont to walk a domain raised far above the actual pathpg 60 of

mortals the greek framed for this chorus the suspended scaffolding of

a fictitious natural state and placed thereon fictitious natural

beings it is on this foundation that tragedy grew up and so it

could of course dispense from the very first with a painful portrayal

of reality yet it is not an arbitrary world placed by fancy betwixt

heaven and earth rather is it a world possessing the same reality

and trustworthiness that olympus with its dwellers possessed for the

believing hellene the satyr as being the dionysian chorist lives

in a religiously acknowledged reality under the sanction of the myth

and cult that tragedy begins with him that the dionysian wisdom of

tragedy speaks through him is just as surprising a phenomenon to us

as in general the derivation of tragedy from the chorus perhaps

we shall get a startingpoint for our inquiry if i put forward the

proposition that the satyr the fictitious natural being is to the

man of culture what dionysian music is to civilisation concerning

this latter richard wagner says that it is neutralised by music even

as lamplight by daylight in like manner i believe the greek man of

culture felt himself neutralised in the presence of the satyric chorus

and this is the most immediate effect of the dionysian tragedy that

the state and society and in general the gaps between man and man

give way to an overwhelming feeling of oneness which leads back to

the heart of nature the metaphysical comfortwith which as i have

here intimated every true tragedy dismisses usthat in spite of

the perpetual change of phenomenapg 61 life at bottom is indestructibly

powerful and pleasurable this comfort appears with corporeal lucidity

as the satyric chorus as the chorus of natural beings who live

ineradicable as it were behind all civilisation and who in spite of

the ceaseless change of generations and the history of nations remain

for ever the same
with this chorus the deepminded hellene who is so singularly

qualified for the most delicate and severe suffering consoles

himselfhe who has glanced with piercing eye into the very heart of

the terrible destructive processes of socalled universal history as

also into the cruelty of nature and is in danger of longing for a

buddhistic negation of the will art saves him and through art life

saves himfor herself
for we must know that in the rapture of the dionysian state with its

annihilation of the ordinary bounds and limits of existence there is

a lethargic element wherein all personal experiences of the past

are submerged it is by this gulf of oblivion that the everyday world

and the world of dionysian reality are separated from each other but

as soon as this everyday reality rises again in consciousness it is

felt as such and nauseates us an ascetic willparalysing mood is

the fruit of these states in this sense the dionysian man may be

said to resemble hamlet both have for once seen into the true nature

of things they have perceived but they are loath to act for

their action cannot change the eternal nature of things they regard

it as shameful or ridiculous that one should require of them to set

aright thepg 62 time which is out of joint knowledge kills action action

requires the veil of illusionit is this lesson which hamlet teaches

and not the cheap wisdom of johnadreams who from too much reflection

as it were from a surplus of possibilities does not arrive at action

at all not reflection notrue knowledge insight into appalling

truth preponderates over all motives inciting to action in hamlet as

well as in the dionysian man no comfort avails any longer his longing

goes beyond a world after death beyond the gods themselves existence

with its glittering reflection in the gods or in an immortal other

world is abjured in the consciousness of the truth he has perceived

man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of

existence he now understands the symbolism in the fate of ophelia he

now discerns the wisdom of the sylvan god silenus and loathing seizes

him
here in this extremest danger of the will art approaches as a

saving and healing enchantress she alone is able to transform these

nauseating reflections on the awfulness or absurdity of existence

into representations wherewith it is possible to live these are the

representations of the sublime as the artistic subjugation of the

awful and the comic as the artistic delivery from the nausea of

the absurd the satyric chorus of dithyramb is the saving deed of

greek art the paroxysms described above spent their force in the

intermediary world of these dionysian followers

the satyr like the idyllic shepherd of our more recent time is the

offspring of a longing after the primitive and the natural but mark

with what firmness and fearlessness the greek embraced the man of

the woods and again how coyly and mawkishly the modern man dallied

with the flattering picture of a tender fluteplaying softnatured

shepherd nature on which as yet no knowledge has been at work

which maintains unbroken barriers to culturethis is what the greek

saw in his satyr which still was not on this account supposed to

coincide with the ape on the contrary it was the archetype of

man the embodiment of his highest and strongest emotions as the

enthusiastic reveller enraptured by the proximity of his god as the

fellowsuffering companion in whom the suffering of the god repeats

itself as the herald of wisdom speaking from the very depths of

nature as the emblem of the sexual omnipotence of nature which the

greek was wont to contemplate with reverential awe the satyr was

something sublime and godlike he could not but appear so especially

to the sad and wearied eye of the dionysian man he would have been

offended by our spurious trickedup shepherd while his eye dwelt

with sublime satisfaction on the naked and unstuntedly magnificent

characters of nature here the illusion of culture was brushed away

from the archetype of man here the true man the bearded satyr

revealed himself who shouts joyfully to his god beforepg 64 him the

cultured man shrank to a lying caricature schiller is right also

with reference to these beginnings of tragic art the chorus is a

living bulwark against the onsets of reality because itthe satyric

chorusportrays existence more truthfully more realistically more

perfectly than the cultured man who ordinarily considers himself as the

only reality the sphere of poetry does not lie outside the world like

some fantastic impossibility of a poets imagination it seeks to be

the very opposite the unvarnished expression of truth and must for

this very reason cast aside the false finery of that supposed reality

of the cultured man the contrast between this intrinsic truth of

nature and the falsehood of culture which poses as the only reality

is similar to that existing between the eternal kernel of things the

thing in itself and the collective world of phenomena and even as

tragedy with its metaphysical comfort points to the eternal life of

this kernel of existence notwithstanding the perpetual dissolution of

phenomena so the symbolism of the satyric chorus already expresses

figuratively this primordial relation between the thing in itself and

phenomenon the idyllic shepherd of the modern man is but a copy of the

sum of the illusions of culture which he calls nature the dionysian

greek desires truth and nature in their most potent formhe sees

himself metamorphosed into the satyr
the revelling crowd of the votaries of dionysus rejoices swayed by

such moods and perceptions the power of which transforms them before

theirpg 65 own eyes so that they imagine they behold themselves as

reconstituted genii of nature as satyrs the later constitution of the

tragic chorus is the artistic imitation of this natural phenomenon

which of course required a separation of the dionysian spectators from

the enchanted dionysians however we must never lose sight of the fact

that the public of the attic tragedy rediscovered itself in the chorus

of the orchestra that there was in reality no antithesis of public

and chorus for all was but one great sublime chorus of dancing and

singing satyrs or of such as allowed themselves to be represented by

the satyrs the schlegelian observation must here reveal itself to us

in a deeper sense the chorus is the ideal spectator5 in so far as

it is the only beholder6 the beholder of the visionary world of

the scene a public of spectators as known to us was unknown to the

greeks in their theatres the terraced structure of the spectators

space rising in concentric arcs enabled every one in the strictest

sense to overlook the entire world of culture around him and in

surfeited contemplation to imagine himself a chorist according to

this view then we may call the chorus in its primitive stage in

prototragedy a selfmirroring of the dionysian man a phenomenon

which may be best exemplified by the process of the actor who if he

be truly gifted sees hovering before his eyes with almost tangible

perceptibility the character he is to represent the satyric chorus

is first of all apg 66 vision of the dionysian throng just as the world

of the stage is in turn a vision of the satyric chorus the power

of this vision is great enough to render the eye dull and insensible

to the impression of reality to the presence of the cultured men

occupying the tiers of seats on every side the form of the greek

theatre reminds one of a lonesome mountainvalley the architecture of

the scene appears like a luminous cloudpicture which the bacchants

swarming on the mountains behold from the heights as the splendid

encirclement in the midst of which the image of dionysus is revealed to

them
owing to our learned conception of the elementary artistic processes

this artistic protophenomenon which is here introduced to explain

the tragic chorus is almost shocking while nothing can be more

certain than that the poet is a poet only in that he beholds himself

surrounded by forms which live and act before him into the innermost

being of which his glance penetrates by reason of a strange defeat in

our capacities we modern men are apt to represent to ourselves the

sthetic protophenomenon as too complex and abstract for the true

poet the metaphor is not a rhetorical figure but a vicarious image

which actually hovers before him in place of a concept the character

is not for him an aggregate composed of a studied collection of

particular traits but an irrepressibly live person appearing before

his eyes and differing only from the corresponding vision of the

painter by its ever continued life and action why is it thatpg 67 homer

sketches much more vividly7 than all the other poets because he

contemplates8 much more we talk so abstractly about poetry because

we are all wont to be bad poets at bottom the sthetic phenomenon is

simple let a man but have the faculty of perpetually seeing a lively

play and of constantly living surrounded by hosts of spirits then he

is a poet let him but feel the impulse to transform himself and to

talk from out the bodies and souls of others then he is a dramatist
the dionysian excitement is able to impart to a whole mass of men

this artistic faculty of seeing themselves surrounded by such a host

of spirits with whom they know themselves to be inwardly one this

function of the tragic chorus is the dramatic protophenomenon to

see ones self transformed before ones self and then to act as if

one had really entered into another body into another character this

function stands at the beginning of the development of the drama

here we have something different from the rhapsodist who does not

blend with his pictures but only sees them like the painter with

contemplative eye outside of him here we actually have a surrender

of the individual by his entering into another nature moreover this

phenomenon appears in the form of an epidemic a whole throng feels

itself metamorphosed in this wise hence it is that the dithyramb is

essentially different from every other variety of the choric song the

virgins who withpg 68 laurel twigs in their hands solemnly proceed to

the temple of apollo and sing a processional hymn remain what they

are and retain their civic names the dithyrambic chorus is a chorus

of transformed beings whose civic past and social rank are totally

forgotten they have become the timeless servants of their god that

live aloof from all the spheres of society every other variety of

the choric lyric of the hellenes is but an enormous enhancement of

the apollonian unitsinger while in the dithyramb we have before us

a community of unconscious actors who mutually regard themselves as

transformed among one another
this enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art in this

enchantment the dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr and as

satyr he in turn beholds the god that is in his transformation he

sees a new vision outside him as the apollonian consummation of his

state with this new vision the drama is complete
according to this view we must understand greek tragedy as the

dionysian chorus which always disburdens itself anew in an apollonian

world of pictures the choric parts therefore with which tragedy is

interlaced are in a manner the motherwomb of the entire socalled

dialogue that is of the whole stageworld of the drama proper in

several successive outbursts does this primordial basis of tragedy beam

forth the vision of the drama which is a dreamphenomenon throughout

and as such epic in character on the other hand however as

objectivation of apg 69 dionysian state it does not represent the

apollonian redemption in appearance but conversely the dissolution

of the individual and his unification with primordial existence

accordingly the drama is the apollonian embodiment of dionysian

perceptions and influences and is thereby separated from the epic as

by an immense gap
the chorus of greek tragedy the symbol of the mass of the people

moved by dionysian excitement is thus fully explained by our

conception of it as here set forth whereas being accustomed to the

position of a chorus on the modern stage especially an operatic

chorus we could never comprehend why the tragic chorus of the greeks

should be older more primitive indeed more important than the

action properas has been so plainly declared by the voice of

tradition whereas furthermore we could not reconcile with this

traditional paramount importance and primitiveness the fact of the

chorus being composed only of humble ministering beings indeed at

first only of goatlike satyrs whereas finally the orchestra before

the scene was always a riddle to us we have learned to comprehend at

length that the scene together with the action was fundamentally

and originally conceived only as a vision that the only reality

is just the chorus which of itself generates the vision and speaks

thereof with the entire symbolism of dancing tone and word this

chorus beholds in the vision its lord and master dionysus and is thus

for ever the serving chorus it sees how he the god suffers and

glorifies himself and therefore does not itself actpg 70 but though its

attitude towards the god is throughout the attitude of ministration

this is nevertheless the highest expression the dionysian expression

of nature and therefore like nature herself the chorus utters

oracles and wise sayings when transported with enthusiasm as

fellowsufferer it is also the sage proclaiming truth from out the

heart of nature thus then originates the fantastic figure which

seems so shocking of the wise and enthusiastic satyr who is at the

same time the dumb man in contrast to the god the image of nature

and her strongest impulses yea the symbol of nature and at the same

time the herald of her art and wisdom musician poet dancer and

visionary in one person
agreeably to this view and agreeably to tradition dionysus the

proper stagehero and focus of vision is not at first actually present

in the oldest period of tragedy but is only imagined as present

ie tragedy is originally only chorus and not drama later

on the attempt is made to exhibit the god as real and to display the

visionary figure together with its glorifying encirclement before the

eyes of all it is here that the drama in the narrow sense of the

term begins to the dithyrambic chorus is now assigned the task of

exciting the minds of the hearers to such a pitch of dionysian frenzy

that when the tragic hero appears on the stage they do not behold

in him say the unshapely masked man but a visionary figure born

as it were of their own ecstasy let us picture admetes thinkingpg 71 in

profound meditation of his lately departed wife alcestis and quite

consuming himself in spiritual contemplation thereofwhen suddenly

the veiled figure of a woman resembling her in form and gait is led

towards him let us picture his sudden trembling anxiety his agitated

comparisons his instinctive convictionand we shall have an analogon

to the sensation with which the spectator excited to dionysian frenzy

saw the god approaching on the stage a god with whose sufferings he

had already become identified he involuntarily transferred the entire

picture of the god fluttering magically before his soul to this

masked figure and resolved its reality as it were into a phantasmal

unreality this is the apollonian dreamstate in which the world

of day is veiled and a new world clearer more intelligible more

striking than the former and nevertheless more shadowy is ever born

anew in perpetual change before our eyes we accordingly recognise in

tragedy a thoroughgoing stylistic contrast the language colour

flexibility and dynamics of the dialogue fall apart in the dionysian

lyrics of the chorus on the one hand and in the apollonian dreamworld

of the scene on the other into entirely separate spheres of

expression the apollonian appearances in which dionysus objectifies

himself are no longer ein ewiges meer ein wechselnd weben ein

glhend leben9 as is the music of the choruspg 72 they are no longer

the forces merely felt but not condensed into a picture by which

the inspired votary of dionysus divines the proximity of his god the

clearness and firmness of epic form now speak to him from the scene

dionysus now no longer speaks through forces but as an epic hero

almost in the language of homer

whatever rises to the surface in the dialogue of the apollonian part

of greek tragedy appears simple transparent beautiful in this

sense the dialogue is a copy of the hellene whose nature reveals

itself in the dance because in the dance the greatest energy is merely

potential but betrays itself nevertheless in flexible and vivacious

movements the language of the sophoclean heroes for instance

surprises us by its apollonian precision and clearness so that we at

once imagine we see into the innermost recesses of their being and

marvel not a little that the way to these recesses is so short but

if for the moment we disregard the character of the hero which rises

to the surface and grows visibleand which at bottom is nothing but

the lightpicture cast on a dark wall that is appearance through and

throughif rather we enter into the myth which projects itself in

these bright mirrorings we shall of a sudden experience a phenomenon

which bears a reverse relation to one familiar in optics when after

a vigorous effort to gaze into the sun we turn away blindedpg 73 we have

darkcoloured spots before our eyes as restoratives so to speak

while on the contrary those lightpicture phenomena of the sophoclean

heroin short the apollonian of the maskare the necessary

productions of a glance into the secret and terrible things of nature

as it were shining spots to heal the eye which dire night has seared

only in this sense can we hope to be able to grasp the true meaning of

the serious and significant notion of greek cheerfulness while of

course we encounter the misunderstood notion of this cheerfulness as

resulting from a state of unendangered comfort on all the ways and

paths of the present time
the most sorrowful figure of the greek stage the hapless dipus

was understood by sophocles as the noble man who in spite of his

wisdom was destined to error and misery but nevertheless through

his extraordinary sufferings ultimately exerted a magical wholesome

influence on all around him which continues effective even after

his death the noble man does not sin this is what the thoughtful

poet wishes to tell us all laws all natural order yea the moral

world itself may be destroyed through his action but through this

very action a higher magic circle of influences is brought into play

which establish a new world on the ruins of the old that has been

overthrown this is what the poet in so far as he is at the same time

a religious thinker wishes to tell us as poet he shows us first of

all a wonderfully complicated legal mystery which the judge slowly

unravels link by link to his own destructionpg 74 the truly hellenic

delight at this dialectical loosening is so great that a touch of

surpassing cheerfulness is thereby communicated to the entire play

which everywhere blunts the edge of the horrible presuppositions of the

procedure in the dipus at colonus we find the same cheerfulness

elevated however to an infinite transfiguration in contrast to

the aged king subjected to an excess of misery and exposed solely

as a sufferer to all that befalls him we have here a supermundane

cheerfulness which descends from a divine sphere and intimates to

us that in his purely passive attitude the hero attains his highest

activity the influence of which extends far beyond his life while

his earlier conscious musing and striving led him only to passivity

thus then the legal knot of the fable of dipus which to mortal

eyes appears indissolubly entangled is slowly unravelledand the

profoundest human joy comes upon us in the presence of this divine

counterpart of dialectics if this explanation does justice to the

poet it may still be asked whether the substance of the myth is

thereby exhausted and here it turns out that the entire conception

of the poet is nothing but the lightpicture which healing nature

holds up to us after a glance into the abyss dipus the murderer of

his father the husband of his mother dipus the interpreter of the

riddle of the sphinx what does the mysterious triad of these deeds

of destiny tell us there is a primitive popular belief especially

in persia that a wise magian can be born only of incest which

we have forthwith to interpret to ourselves with reference to the

riddlesolvingpg 75 and mothermarrying dipus to the effect that when

the boundary of the present and future the rigid law of individuation

and in general the intrinsic spell of nature are broken by prophetic

and magical powers an extraordinary counternaturalnessas in this

case incestmust have preceded as a cause for how else could one

force nature to surrender her secrets but by victoriously opposing her

ie by means of the unnatural it is this intuition which i see

imprinted in the awful triad of the destiny of dipus the very man

who solves the riddle of naturethat doubleconstituted sphinxmust

also as the murderer of his father and husband of his mother break

the holiest laws of nature indeed it seems as if the myth sought to

whisper into our ears that wisdom especially dionysian wisdom is

an unnatural abomination and that whoever through his knowledge

plunges nature into an abyss of annihilation must also experience

the dissolution of nature in himself the sharpness of wisdom turns

round upon the sage wisdom is a crime against nature such terrible

expressions does the myth call out to us but the hellenic poet touches

like a sunbeam the sublime and formidable memnonian statue of the myth

so that it suddenly begins to soundin sophoclean melodies
with the glory of passivity i now contrast the glory of activity which

illuminates the prometheus of schylus that which schylus the

thinker had to tell us here but which as a poet he only allows us to

surmise by his symbolic picture the youthful goethe succeededpg 76 in

disclosing to us in the daring words of his prometheus


hier sitz ich forme menschen

nach meinem bilde

ein geschlecht das mir gleich sei

zu leiden zu weinen

zu geniessen und zu freuen sich

und dein nicht zu achten

man elevating himself to the rank of the titans acquires his culture

by his own efforts and compels the gods to unite with him because

in his selfsufficient wisdom he has their existence and their limits

in his hand what is most wonderful however in this promethean

form which according to its fundamental conception is the specific

hymn of impiety is the profound schylean yearning for justice

the untold sorrow of the bold singlehanded being on the one hand

and the divine need ay the foreboding of a twilight of the gods on

the other the power of these two worlds of suffering constraining

to reconciliation to metaphysical onenessall this suggests most

forcibly the central and main position of the schyleanpg 77 view of

things which sees moira as eternal justice enthroned above gods and

men in view of the astonishing boldness with which schylus places the

olympian world on his scales of justice it must be remembered that

the deepminded greek had an immovably firm substratum of metaphysical

thought in his mysteries and that all his sceptical paroxysms could

be discharged upon the olympians with reference to these deities

the greek artist in particular had an obscure feeling as to mutual

dependency and it is just in the prometheus of schylus that this

feeling is symbolised the titanic artist found in himself the

daring belief that he could create men and at least destroy olympian

deities namely by his superior wisdom for which to be sure he had

to atone by eternal suffering the splendid caning of the great

genius bought too cheaply even at the price of eternal suffering

the stern pride of the artist this is the essence and soul of

schylean poetry while sophocles in his dipus preludingly strikes up

the victorysong of the saint but even this interpretation which

schylus has given to the myth does not fathom its astounding depth of

terror the fact is rather that the artists delight in unfolding the

cheerfulness of artistic creating bidding defiance to all calamity

is but a shining stellar and nebular image reflected in a black sea

of sadness the tale of prometheus is an original possession of the

entire aryan family of races and documentary evidence of their

capacity for the profoundly tragic indeed it is not improbable that

this myth has the same characteristic significancepg 78 for the aryan

race that the myth of the fall of man has for the semitic and that

there is a relationship between the two myths like that of brother and

sister the presupposition of the promethean myth is the transcendent

value which a nave humanity attach to fire as the true palladium

of every ascending culture that man however should dispose at will

of this fire and should not receive it only as a gift from heaven

as the igniting lightning or the warming solar flame appeared to the

contemplative primordial men as crime and robbery of the divine nature

and thus the first philosophical problem at once causes a painful

irreconcilable antagonism between man and god and puts as it were

a mass of rock at the gate of every culture the best and highest

that men can acquire they obtain by a crime and must now in their

turn take upon themselves its consequences namely the whole flood of

sufferings and sorrows with which the offended celestials must visit

the nobly aspiring race of man a bitter reflection which by the

dignity it confers on crime contrasts strangely with the semitic

myth of the fall of man in which curiosity beguilement seducibility

wantonnessin short a whole series of preeminently feminine

passionswere regarded as the origin of evil what distinguishes

the aryan representation is the sublime view of active sin as the

properly promethean virtue which suggests at the same time the ethical

basis of pessimistic tragedy as the justification of human evilof

human guilt as well as of the suffering incurred thereby the misery in

the essence of thingswhichpg 79 the contemplative aryan is not disposed

to explain awaythe antagonism in the heart of the world manifests

itself to him as a medley of different worlds for instance a divine

and a human world each of which is in the right individually but

as a separate existence alongside of another has to suffer for its

individuation with the heroic effort made by the individual for

universality in his attempt to pass beyond the bounds of individuation

and become the one universal being he experiences in himself the

primordial contradiction concealed in the essence of things ie

he trespasses and suffers accordingly crime11 is understood by

the aryans to be a man sin12 by the semites a woman as also the

original crime is committed by man the original sin by woman besides

the witches chorus says


wir nehmen das nicht so genau

mit tausend schritten machts die frau

doch wie sie auch sich eilen kann

mit einem sprunge machts der mann13

he who understands this innermost core of the tale of

prometheusnamely the necessity of crime imposed on the titanically

striving individualwill at once be conscious of the unapollonian

nature of this pessimistic representation for apollo seeks to pacify

individual beings precisely by drawingpg 80 boundary lines between them

and by again and again calling attention thereto with his requirements

of selfknowledge and due proportion as the holiest laws of the

universe in order however to prevent the form from congealing to

egyptian rigidity and coldness in consequence of this apollonian

tendency in order to prevent the extinction of the motion of the

entire lake in the effort to prescribe to the individual wave its path

and compass the high tide of the dionysian tendency destroyed from

time to time all the little circles in which the onesided apollonian

will sought to confine the hellenic world the suddenly swelling

tide of the dionysian then takes the separate little wavemountains of

individuals on its back just as the brother of prometheus the titan

atlas does with the earth this titanic impulse to become as it were

the atlas of all individuals and to carry them on broad shoulders

higher and higher farther and farther is what the promethean and the

dionysian have in common in this respect the schylean prometheus is

a dionysian mask while in the aforementioned profound yearning for

justice schylus betrays to the intelligent observer his paternal

descent from apollo the god of individuation and of the boundaries

of justice and so the doublebeing of the schylean prometheus his

conjoint dionysian and apollonian nature might be thus expressed in

an abstract formula whatever exists is alike just and unjust and

equally justified in both

it is an indisputable tradition that greek tragedy in its earliest

form had for its theme only the sufferings of dionysus and that for

some time the only stagehero therein was simply dionysus himself

with the same confidence however we can maintain that not until

euripides did dionysus cease to be the tragic hero and that in fact

all the celebrated figures of the greek stageprometheus dipus

etcare but masks of this original hero dionysus the presence of a

god behind all these masks is the one essential cause of the typical

ideality so oft exciting wonder of these celebrated figures some

one i know not whom has maintained that all individuals are comic as

individuals and are consequently untragic from whence it might be

inferred that the greeks in general could not endure individuals on

the tragic stage and they really seem to have had these sentiments

as in general it is to be observed that the platonic discrimination

and valuation of the idea in contrast to the eidolon the image

is deeply rooted in the hellenic being availing ourselves of platos

terminology however we should have to speak of the tragic figures of

the hellenic stage somewhat as follows the one truly real dionysus

appears in a multiplicity of forms in the mask of a fighting hero

and entangled as it were in the net of an individual will as the

visibly appearing god now talks and acts he resembles an erring

striving sufferingpg 82 individual and that in general he appears

with such epic precision and clearness is due to the dreamreading

apollo who reads to the chorus its dionysian state through this

symbolic appearance in reality however this hero is the suffering

dionysus of the mysteries a god experiencing in himself the sufferings

of individuation of whom wonderful myths tell that as a boy he was

dismembered by the titans and has been worshipped in this state

as zagreus15 whereby is intimated that this dismemberment the

properly dionysian suffering is like a transformation into air

water earth and fire that we must therefore regard the state of

individuation as the source and primal cause of all suffering as

something objectionable in itself from the smile of this dionysus

sprang the olympian gods from his tears sprang man in his existence

as a dismembered god dionysus has the dual nature of a cruel

barbarised demon and a mild pacific ruler but the hope of the epopts

looked for a new birth of dionysus which we have now to conceive of in

anticipation as the end of individuation it was for this coming third

dionysus that the stormy jubilationhymns of the epopts resounded and

it is only this hope that sheds a ray of joy upon the features of a

world torn asunder and shattered into individuals as is symbolised in

the myth by demeter sunk in eternal sadness who rejoices again only

when toldpg 83 that she may once more give birth to dionysus in the views

of things here given we already have all the elements of a profound and

pessimistic contemplation of the world and along with these we have

the mystery doctrine of tragedy the fundamental knowledge of the

oneness of all existing things the consideration of individuation as

the primal cause of evil and art as the joyous hope that the spell of

individuation may be broken as the augury of a restored oneness
it has already been intimated that the homeric epos is the poem

of olympian culture wherewith this culture has sung its own song

of triumph over the terrors of the war of the titans under the

predominating influence of tragic poetry these homeric myths are now

reproduced anew and show by this metempsychosis that meantime the

olympian culture also has been vanquished by a still deeper view of

things the haughty titan prometheus has announced to his olympian

tormentor that the extremest danger will one day menace his rule

unless he ally with him betimes in schylus we perceive the terrified

zeus apprehensive of his end in alliance with the titan thus the

former age of the titans is subsequently brought from tartarus once

more to the light of day the philosophy of wild and naked nature

beholds with the undissembled mien of truth the myths of the homeric

world as they dance past they turn pale they tremble before the

lightning glance of this goddesstill the powerful fist16 ofpg 84

the dionysian artist forces them into the service of the new deity

dionysian truth takes over the entire domain of myth as symbolism of

its knowledge which it makes known partly in the public cult of

tragedy and partly in the secret celebration of the dramatic mysteries

always however in the old mythical garb what was the power which

freed prometheus from his vultures and transformed the myth into a

vehicle of dionysian wisdom it is the heracleian power of music

which having reached its highest manifestness in tragedy can invest

myths with a new and most profound significance which we have already

had occasion to characterise as the most powerful faculty of music for

it is the fate of every myth to insinuate itself into the narrow limits

of some alleged historical reality and to be treated by some later

generation as a solitary fact with historical claims and the greeks

were already fairly on the way to restamp the whole of their mythical

juvenile dream sagaciously and arbitrarily into a historicopragmatical

juvenile history for this is the manner in which religions are

wont to die out when of course under the stern intelligent eyes of

an orthodox dogmatism the mythical presuppositions of a religion are

systematised as a completed sum of historical events and when one

begins apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myth while at

the same time opposing all continuation of their natural vitality and

luxuriance when accordingly the feeling for myth dies out and its

place is taken by the claim of religion to historicalpg 85 foundations

this dying myth was now seized by the newborn genius of dionysian

music in whose hands it bloomed once more with such colours as it

had never yet displayed with a fragrance that awakened a longing

anticipation of a metaphysical world after this final effulgence

it collapses its leaves wither and soon the scoffing lucians of

antiquity catch at the discoloured and faded flowers which the winds

carry off in every direction through tragedy the myth attains its

profoundest significance its most expressive form it rises once more

like a wounded hero and the whole surplus of vitality together with

the philosophical calmness of the dying burns in its eyes with a last

powerful gleam
what meantest thou oh impious euripides in seeking once more to

enthral this dying one it died under thy ruthless hands and then

thou madest use of counterfeit masked myth which like the ape of

heracles could only trick itself out in the old finery and as myth

died in thy hands so also died the genius of music though thou

couldst covetously plunder all the gardens of musicthou didst only

realise a counterfeit masked music and because thou hast forsaken

dionysus apollo hath also forsaken thee rout up all the passions from

their haunts and conjure them into thy sphere sharpen and polish a

sophistical dialectics for the speeches of thy heroesthy very heroes

have only counterfeit masked passions and speak only counterfeit

masked music

greek tragedy had a fate different from that of all her older sister

arts she died by suicide in consequence of an irreconcilable

conflict accordingly she died tragically while they all passed away

very calmly and beautifully in ripe old age for if it be in accordance

with a happy state of things to depart this life without a struggle

leaving behind a fair posterity the closing period of these older

arts exhibits such a happy state of things slowly they sink out of

sight and before their dying eyes already stand their fairer progeny

who impatiently lift up their heads with courageous mien the death of

greek tragedy on the other hand left an immense void deeply felt

everywhere even as certain greek sailors in the time of tiberius once

heard upon a lonesome island the thrilling cry great pan is dead so

now as it were sorrowful wailing sounded through the hellenic world

tragedy is dead poetry itself has perished with her begone begone

ye stunted emaciated epigones begone to hades that ye may for once

eat your fill of the crumbs of your former masters
but when after all a new art blossomed forth which revered tragedy as

her ancestress and mistress it was observed with horror that she did

indeed bear the features of her mother but those very features the

latter had exhibited in her long deathstruggle it was euripides who

fought this deathstruggle of tragedy the later art is known as the

new attic comedy in it the degeneratepg 87 form of tragedy lived on as a

monument of the most painful and violent death of tragedy proper
this connection between the two serves to explain the passionate

attachment to euripides evinced by the poets of the new comedy and

hence we are no longer surprised at the wish of philemon who would

have got himself hanged at once with the sole design of being able

to visit euripides in the lower regions if only he could be assured

generally that the deceased still had his wits but if we desire as

briefly as possible and without professing to say aught exhaustive on

the subject to characterise what euripides has in common with menander

and philemon and what appealed to them so strongly as worthy of

imitation it will suffice to say that the spectator was brought upon

the stage by euripides he who has perceived the material of which the

promethean tragic writers prior to euripides formed their heroes and

how remote from their purpose it was to bring the true mask of reality

on the stage will also know what to make of the wholly divergent

tendency of euripides through him the commonplace individual forced

his way from the spectators benches to the stage itself the mirror in

which formerly only great and bold traits found expression now showed

the painful exactness that conscientiously reproduces even the abortive

lines of nature odysseus the typical hellene of the old art sank

in the hands of the new poets to the figure of the grculus who as

the goodnaturedly cunning domestic slave stands henceforth in the

centre of dramaticpg 88 interest what euripides takes credit for in the

aristophanean frogs namely that by his household remedies he freed

tragic art from its pompous corpulency is apparent above all in his

tragic heroes the spectator now virtually saw and heard his double on

the euripidean stage and rejoiced that he could talk so well but this

joy was not all one even learned of euripides how to speak he prides

himself upon this in his contest with schylus how the people have

learned from him how to observe debate and draw conclusions according

to the rules of art and with the cleverest sophistications in general

it may be said that through this revolution of the popular language he

made the new comedy possible for it was henceforth no longer a secret

howand with what sawsthe commonplace could represent and express

itself on the stage civic mediocrity on which euripides built all

his political hopes was now suffered to speak while heretofore the

demigod in tragedy and the drunken satyr or demiman in comedy had

determined the character of the language and so the aristophanean

euripides prides himself on having portrayed the common familiar

everyday life and dealings of the people concerning which all are

qualified to pass judgment if now the entire populace philosophises

manages land and goods with unheardof circumspection and conducts

lawsuits he takes all the credit to himself and glories in the

splendid results of the wisdom with which he inoculated the rabble
it was to a populace prepared and enlightenedpg 89 in this manner that the

new comedy could now address itself of which euripides had become

as it were the chorusmaster only that in this case the chorus of

spectators had to be trained as soon as this chorus was trained to

sing in the euripidean key there arose that chesslike variety of the

drama the new comedy with its perpetual triumphs of cunning and

artfulness but euripidesthe chorusmasterwas praised incessantly

indeed people would have killed themselves in order to learn yet more

from him had they not known that tragic poets were quite as dead as

tragedy but with it the hellene had surrendered the belief in his

immortality not only the belief in an ideal past but also the belief

in an ideal future the saying taken from the wellknown epitaph as

an old man frivolous and capricious applies also to aged hellenism

the passing moment wit levity and caprice are its highest deities

the fifth class that of the slaves now attains to power at least in

sentiment and if we can still speak at all of greek cheerfulness

it is the cheerfulness of the slave who has nothing of consequence to

answer for nothing great to strive for and cannot value anything of

the past or future higher than the present it was this semblance of

greek cheerfulness which so revolted the deepminded and formidable

natures of the first four centuries of christianity this womanish

flight from earnestness and terror this cowardly contentedness with

easy pleasure was not only contemptible to them but seemed to be a

specifically antichristian sentiment and we must ascribepg 90 it to its

influence that the conception of greek antiquity which lived on for

centuries preserved with almost enduring persistency that peculiar

hectic colour of cheerfulnessas if there had never been a sixth

century with its birth of tragedy its mysteries its pythagoras and

heraclitus indeed as if the artworks of that great period did not at

all exist which in facteach by itselfcan in no wise be explained

as having sprung from the soil of such a decrepit and slavish love

of existence and cheerfulness and point to an altogether different

conception of things as their source
the assertion made a moment ago that euripides introduced the

spectator on the stage to qualify him the better to pass judgment on

the drama will make it appear as if the old tragic art was always

in a false relation to the spectator and one would be tempted to

extol the radical tendency of euripides to bring about an adequate

relation between artwork and public as an advance on sophocles but

as things are public is merely a word and not at all a homogeneous

and constant quantity why should the artist be under obligations to

accommodate himself to a power whose strength is merely in numbers

and if by virtue of his endowments and aspirations he feels himself

superior to every one of these spectators how could he feel greater

respect for the collective expression of all these subordinate

capacities than for the relatively highestendowed individual

spectator in truth if ever a greek artist treated his public

throughout a long life with presumptuousness and selfsufficiency

it was euripides whopg 91 even when the masses threw themselves at his

feet with sublime defiance made an open assault on his own tendency

the very tendency with which he had triumphed over the masses if this

genius had had the slightest reverence for the pandemonium of the

public he would have broken down long before the middle of his career

beneath the weighty blows of his own failures these considerations

here make it obvious that our formulanamely that euripides brought

the spectator upon the stage in order to make him truly competent to

pass judgmentwas but a provisional one and that we must seek for a

deeper understanding of his tendency conversely it is undoubtedly

well known that schylus and sophocles during all their lives indeed

far beyond their lives enjoyed the full favour of the people and that

therefore in the case of these predecessors of euripides the idea of

a false relation between artwork and public was altogether excluded

what was it that thus forcibly diverted this highly gifted artist so

incessantly impelled to production from the path over which shone the

sun of the greatest names in poetry and the cloudless heaven of popular

favour what strange consideration for the spectator led him to defy

the spectator how could he owing to too much respect for the public

disrespect the public
euripidesand this is the solution of the riddle just propoundedfelt

himself as a poet undoubtedly superior to the masses but not to

two of his spectators he brought the masses upon the stage these

two spectators he revered as thepg 92 only competent judges and masters

of his art in compliance with their directions and admonitions he

transferred the entire world of sentiments passions and experiences

hitherto present at every festival representation as the invisible

chorus on the spectators benches into the souls of his stageheroes

he yielded to their demands when he also sought for these new

characters the new word and the new tone in their voices alone he

heard the conclusive verdict on his work as also the cheering promise

of triumph when he found himself condemned as usual by the justice of

the public
of these two spectators the one iseuripides himself euripides as

thinker not as poet it might be said of him that his unusually

large fund of critical ability as in the case of lessing if it did

not create at least constantly fructified a productively artistic

collateral impulse with this faculty with all the clearness and

dexterity of his critical thought euripides had sat in the theatre and

striven to recognise in the masterpieces of his great predecessors as

in faded paintings feature and feature line and line and here had

happened to him what one initiated in the deeper arcana of schylean

tragedy must needs have expected he observed something incommensurable

in every feature and in every line a certain deceptive distinctness

and at the same time an enigmatic profundity yea an infinitude of

background even the clearest figure had always a comets tail attached

to it which seemed to suggest the uncertain and the inexplicable

the same twilight shrouded the structure of the drama especially the

significancepg 93 of the chorus and how doubtful seemed the solution of

the ethical problems to his mind how questionable the treatment of

the myths how unequal the distribution of happiness and misfortune

even in the language of the old tragedy there was much that was

objectionable to him or at least enigmatical he found especially

too much pomp for simple affairs too many tropes and immense things

for the plainness of the characters thus he sat restlessly pondering

in the theatre and as a spectator he acknowledged to himself that he

did not understand his great predecessors if however he thought the

understanding the root proper of all enjoyment and productivity he had

to inquire and look about to see whether any one else thought as he

did and also acknowledged this incommensurability but most people

and among them the best individuals had only a distrustful smile for

him while none could explain why the great masters were still in the

right in face of his scruples and objections and in this painful

condition he found that other spectator who did not comprehend

and therefore did not esteem tragedy in alliance with him he could

venture from amid his lonesomeness to begin the prodigious struggle

against the art of schylus and sophoclesnot with polemic writings

but as a dramatic poet who opposed his own conception of tragedy to

the traditional one
pg 94
12
before we name this other spectator let us pause here a moment in

order to recall our own impression as previously described of the

discordant and incommensurable elements in the nature of schylean

tragedy let us think of our own astonishment at the chorus and

the tragic hero of that type of tragedy neither of which we could

reconcile with our practices any more than with traditiontill we

rediscovered this duplexity itself as the origin and essence of greek

tragedy as the expression of two interwoven artistic impulses the

apollonian and the dionysian
to separate this primitive and allpowerful dionysian element from

tragedy and to build up a new and purified form of tragedy on the

basis of a nondionysian art morality and conception of thingssuch

is the tendency of euripides which now reveals itself to us in a clear

light
in a myth composed in the eve of his life euripides himself most

urgently propounded to his contemporaries the question as to the

value and signification of this tendency is the dionysian entitled

to exist at all should it not be forcibly rooted out of the hellenic

soil certainly the poet tells us if only it were possible but the

god dionysus is too powerful his most intelligent adversarylike

pentheus in the bacchis unwittingly enchanted by him and

in this enchantment meets his fate the judgment of the two old

sages cadmus and tiresias seems to be also the judgment of thepg 95

aged poet that the reflection of the wisest individuals does not

overthrow old popular traditions nor the perpetually propagating

worship of dionysus that in fact it behoves us to display at least a

diplomatically cautious concern in the presence of such strange forces

where however it is always possible that the god may take offence

at such lukewarm participation and finally change the diplomatin

this case cadmusinto a dragon this is what a poet tells us who

opposed dionysus with heroic valour throughout a long lifein order

finally to wind up his career with a glorification of his adversary

and with suicide like one staggering from giddiness who in order

to escape the horrible vertigo he can no longer endure casts himself

from a tower this tragedythe bacchis a protest against the

practicability of his own tendency alas and it has already been

put into practice the surprising thing had happened when the poet

recanted his tendency had already conquered dionysus had already

been scared from the tragic stage and in fact by a demonic power

which spoke through euripides even euripides was in a certain sense

only a mask the deity that spoke through him was neither dionysus nor

apollo but an altogether newborn demon called socrates this is

the new antithesis the dionysian and the socratic and the artwork of

greek tragedy was wrecked on it what if even euripides now seeks to

comfort us by his recantation it is of no avail the most magnificent

temple lies in ruins what avails the lamentation of the destroyer

and hispg 96 confession that it was the most beautiful of all temples and

even that euripides has been changed into a dragon as a punishment by

the artcritics of all ageswho could be content with this wretched

compensation
let us now approach this socratic tendency with which euripides

combated and vanquished schylean tragedy
we must now ask ourselves what could be the ulterior aim of the

euripidean design which in the highest ideality of its execution

would found drama exclusively on the nondionysian what other form of

drama could there be if it was not to be born of the womb of music in

the mysterious twilight of the dionysian only the dramatised epos

in which apollonian domain of art the tragic effect is of course

unattainable it does not depend on the subjectmatter of the events

here represented indeed i venture to assert that it would have been

impossible for goethe in his projected nausikaa to have rendered

tragically effective the suicide of the idyllic being with which he

intended to complete the fifth act so extraordinary is the power of

the epicapollonian representation that it charms before our eyes

the most terrible things by the joy in appearance and in redemption

through appearance the poet of the dramatised epos cannot completely

blend with his pictures any more than the epic rhapsodist he is still

just the calm unmoved embodiment of contemplation whose wide eyes see

the picture before them the actor in this dramatised epos still

remains intrinsically rhapsodist the consecrationpg 97 of inner dreaming

is on all his actions so that he is never wholly an actor
how then is the euripidean play related to this ideal of the

apollonian drama just as the younger rhapsodist is related to the

solemn rhapsodist of the old time the former describes his own

character in the platonic ion as follows when i am saying anything

sad my eyes fill with tears when however what i am saying is awful

and terrible then my hair stands on end through fear and my heart

leaps here we no longer observe anything of the epic absorption

in appearance or of the unemotional coolness of the true actor

who precisely in his highest activity is wholly appearance and joy

in appearance euripides is the actor with leaping heart with hair

standing on end as socratic thinker he designs the plan as passionate

actor he executes it neither in the designing nor in the execution is

he an artist pure and simple and so the euripidean drama is a thing

both cool and fiery equally capable of freezing and burning it is

impossible for it to attain the apollonian effect of the epos while

on the other hand it has severed itself as much as possible from

dionysian elements and now in order to act at all it requires new

stimulants which can no longer lie within the sphere of the two unique

artimpulses the apollonian and the dionysian the stimulants are

cool paradoxical thoughts in place of apollonian intuitionsand

fiery passionsin place dionysean ecstasies and in fact thoughts

and passions very realistically copied and not at all steeped in the

ether of art
pg 98
accordingly if we have perceived this much that euripides did not

succeed in establishing the drama exclusively on the apollonian but

that rather his nondionysian inclinations deviated into a naturalistic

and inartistic tendency we shall now be able to approach nearer to

the character sthetic socratism supreme law of which reads about

as follows to be beautiful everything must be intelligible as

the parallel to the socratic proposition only the knowing is one

virtuous with this canon in his hands euripides measured all the

separate elements of the drama and rectified them according to his

principle the language the characters the dramaturgic structure and

the choric music the poetic deficiency and retrogression which we

are so often wont to impute to euripides in comparison with sophoclean

tragedy is for the most part the product of this penetrating critical

process this daring intelligibility the euripidian prologue may

serve us as an example of the productivity of this rationalistic

method nothing could be more opposed to the technique of our stage

than the prologue in the drama of euripides for a single person to

appear at the outset of the play telling us who he is what precedes

the action what has happened thus far yea what will happen in

the course of the play would be designated by a modern playwright

as a wanton and unpardonable abandonment of the effect of suspense

everything that is about to happen is known beforehand who then

cares to wait for it actually to happenconsidering moreover that

here there is not by any means the exciting relation of a predicting

dream to a realitypg 99 taking place later on euripides speculated quite

differently the effect of tragedy never depended on epic suspense on

the fascinating uncertainty as to what is to happen now and afterwards

but rather on the great rhetorolyric scenes in which the passion and

dialectics of the chief hero swelled to a broad and mighty stream

everything was arranged for pathos not for action and whatever

was not arranged for pathos was regarded as objectionable but what

interferes most with the hearers pleasurable satisfaction in such

scenes is a missing link a gap in the texture of the previous history

so long as the spectator has to divine the meaning of this or that

person or the presuppositions of this or that conflict of inclinations

and intentions his complete absorption in the doings and sufferings

of the chief persons is impossible as is likewise breathless

fellowfeeling and fellowfearing the schyleosophoclean tragedy

employed the most ingenious devices in the first scenes to place in

the hands of the spectator as if by chance all the threads requisite

for understanding the whole a trait in which that noble artistry is

approved which as it were masks the inevitably formal and causes

it to appear as something accidental but nevertheless euripides

thought he observed that during these first scenes the spectator was

in a strange state of anxiety to make out the problem of the previous

history so that the poetic beauties and pathos of the exposition

were lost to him accordingly he placed the prologue even before the

exposition and put it in the mouth of a person who could be trusted

some deity had oftenpg 100 as it were to guarantee the particulars of the

tragedy to the public and remove every doubt as to the reality of the

myth as in the case of descartes who could only prove the reality

of the empiric world by an appeal to the truthfulness of god and his

inability to utter falsehood euripides makes use of the same divine

truthfulness once more at the close of his drama in order to ensure to

the public the future of his heroes this is the task of the notorious

deus ex machina between the preliminary and the additional epic

spectacle there is the dramaticolyric present the drama proper
thus euripides as a poet echoes above all his own conscious

knowledge and it is precisely on this account that he occupies such

a notable position in the history of greek art with reference to his

criticoproductive activity he must often have felt that he ought

to actualise in the drama the words at the beginning of the essay of

anaxagoras in the beginning all things were mixed together then

came the understanding and created order and if anaxagoras with his

 seemed like the first sober person among nothing but drunken

philosophers euripides may also have conceived his relation to

the other tragic poets under a similar figure as long as the sole

ruler and disposer of the universe the  was still excluded

from artistic activity things were all mixed together in a chaotic

primitive messit is thus euripides was obliged to think it is thus

he was obliged to condemn the drunken poets as the first sober one

among them what sophocles said of schylus that he did what waspg 101

right though unconsciously was surely not in the mind of euripides

who would have admitted only thus much that schylus because he

wrought unconsciously did what was wrong so also the divine plato

speaks for the most part only ironically of the creative faculty of the

poet in so far as it is not conscious insight and places it on a par

with the gift of the soothsayer and dreaminterpreter insinuating that

the poet is incapable of composing until he has become unconscious and

reason has deserted him like plato euripides undertook to show to the

world the reverse of the unintelligent poet his sthetic principle

that to be beautiful everything must be known is as i have said

the parallel to the socratic to be good everything must be known

accordingly we may regard euripides as the poet of sthetic socratism

socrates however was that second spectator who did not comprehend

and therefore did not esteem the old tragedy in alliance with him

euripides ventured to be the herald of a new artistic activity if

then the old tragedy was here destroyed it follows that sthetic

socratism was the murderous principle but in so far as the struggle is

directed against the dionysian element in the old art we recognise in

socrates the opponent of dionysus the new orpheus who rebels against

dionysus and although destined to be torn to pieces by the mnads of

the athenian court yet puts to flight the overpowerful god himself

who when he fled from lycurgus the king of edoni sought refuge in

the depths of the oceannamely in the mystical flood of a secret

cult which gradually overspread the earth
pg 102
13
that socrates stood in close relationship to euripides in the tendency

of his teaching did not escape the notice of contemporaneous

antiquity the most eloquent expression of this felicitous insight

being the tale current in athens that socrates was accustomed to help

euripides in poetising both names were mentioned in one breath by the

adherents of the good old time whenever they came to enumerating the

popular agitators of the day to whose influence they attributed the

fact that the old marathonian stalwart capacity of body and soul was

more and more being sacrificed to a dubious enlightenment involving

progressive degeneration of the physical and mental powers it is in

this tone half indignantly and half contemptuously that aristophanic

comedy is wont to speak of both of themto the consternation of

modern men who would indeed be willing enough to give up euripides

but cannot suppress their amazement that socrates should appear in

aristophanes as the first and head sophist as the mirror and epitome

of all sophistical tendencies in connection with which it offers the

single consolation of putting aristophanes himself in the pillory as a

rakish lying alcibiades of poetry without here defending the profound

instincts of aristophanes against such attacks i shall now indicate

by means of the sentiments of the time the close connection between

socrates and euripides with this purpose in view it is especially to

bepg 103 remembered that socrates as an opponent of tragic art did not

ordinarily patronise tragedy but only appeared among the spectators

when a new play of euripides was performed the most noted thing

however is the close juxtaposition of the two names in the delphic

oracle which designated socrates as the wisest of men but at the same

time decided that the second prize in the contest of wisdom was due to

euripides
sophocles was designated as the third in this scale of rank he who

could pride himself that in comparison with schylus he did what

was right and did it moreover because he knew what was right it

is evidently just the degree of clearness of this knowledge which

distinguishes these three men in common as the three knowing ones of

their age
the most decisive word however for this new and unprecedented

esteem of knowledge and insight was spoken by socrates when he

found that he was the only one who acknowledged to himself that he

knew nothing while in his critical pilgrimage through athens and

calling on the greatest statesmen orators poets and artists he

discovered everywhere the conceit of knowledge he perceived to his

astonishment that all these celebrities were without a proper and

accurate insight even with regard to their own callings and practised

them only by instinct only by instinct with this phrase we touch

upon the heart and core of the socratic tendency socratism condemns

therewith existing art as well as existing ethics wherever socratism

turns itspg 104 searching eyes it beholds the lack of insight and the

power of illusion and from this lack infers the inner perversity and

objectionableness of existing conditions from this point onwards

socrates believed that he was called upon to correct existence

and with an air of disregard and superiority as the precursor

of an altogether different culture art and morality he enters

singlehanded into a world of which if we reverently touched the hem

we should count it our greatest happiness
here is the extraordinary hesitancy which always seizes upon us with

regard to socrates and again and again invites us to ascertain the

sense and purpose of this most questionable phenomenon of antiquity

who is it that ventures singlehanded to disown the greek character

which as homer pindar and schylus as phidias as pericles as

pythia and dionysus as the deepest abyss and the highest height is

sure of our wondering admiration what demoniac power is it which would

presume to spill this magic draught in the dust what demigod is it to

whom the chorus of spirits of the noblest of mankind must call out

weh weh du hast sie zerstrt die schne welt mit mchtiger faust

sie strzt sie zerfllt17
pg 105
a key to the character of socrates is presented to us by the surprising

phenomenon designated as the daimonion of socrates in special

circumstances when his gigantic intellect began to stagger he got

a secure support in the utterances of a divine voice which then

spake to him this voice whenever it comes always dissuades

in this totally abnormal nature instinctive wisdom only appears in

order to hinder the progress of conscious perception here and there

while in all productive men it is instinct which is the creatively

affirmative force consciousness only comporting itself critically

and dissuasively with socrates it is instinct which becomes critic

it is consciousness which becomes creatora perfect monstrosity

per defectum and we do indeed observe here a monstrous defectus

of all mystical aptitude so that socrates might be designated as

the specific nonmystic in whom the logical nature is developed

through a superfoetation to the same excess as instinctive wisdom

is developed in the mystic on the other hand however the logical

instinct which appeared in socrates was absolutely prohibited from

turning against itself in its unchecked flow it manifests a native

power such as we meet with to our shocking surprise only among the

very greatest instinctive forces he who has experienced even a breath

of the divine navet and security of the socratic course of life in

the platonic writings will also feel that the enormous drivingwheel

of logical socratism is in motion as it were behind socrates and

that it must be viewed through socrates as through apg 106 shadow and

that he himself had a boding of this relation is apparent from the

dignified earnestness with which he everywhere and even before his

judges insisted on his divine calling to refute him here was really

as impossible as to approve of his instinctdisintegrating influence

in view of this indissoluble conflict when he had at last been brought

before the forum of the greek state there was only one punishment

demanded namely exile he might have been sped across the borders as

something thoroughly enigmatical irrubricable and inexplicable and so

posterity would have been quite unjustified in charging the athenians

with a deed of ignominy but that the sentence of death and not mere

exile was pronounced upon him seems to have been brought about by

socrates himself with perfect knowledge of the circumstances and

without the natural fear of death he met his death with the calmness

with which according to the description of plato he leaves the

symposium at break of day as the last of the revellers to begin a new

day while the sleepy companions remain behind on the benches and the

floor to dream of socrates the true eroticist the dying socrates

became the new ideal of the noble greek youthsan ideal they had

never yet beheldand above all the typical hellenic youth plato

prostrated himself before this scene with all the fervent devotion of

his visionary soul

let us now imagine the one great cyclopean eye of socrates fixed on

tragedy that eye in which the fine frenzy of artistic enthusiasm had

never glowedlet us think how it was denied to this eye to gaze with

pleasure into the dionysian abysseswhat could it not but see in the

sublime and greatly lauded tragic art as plato called it something

very absurd with causes that seemed to be without effects and

effects apparently without causes the whole moreover so motley and

diversified that it could not but be repugnant to a thoughtful mind a

dangerous incentive however to sensitive and irritable souls we know

what was the sole kind of poetry which he comprehended the sopian

fable and he did this no doubt with that smiling complaisance with

which the good honest gellert sings the praise of poetry in the fable

of the bee and the hen


du siehst an mir wozu sie ntzt

dem der nicht viel verstand besitzt

die wahrheit durch ein bild zu sagen18

but then it seemed to socrates that tragic art did not even tell the

truth not to mention the fact that it addresses itself to him who

hath but little wit consequently not to the philosopher a twofold

reason why it should be avoided likepg 108 plato he reckoned it among the

seductive arts which only represent the agreeable not the useful and

hence he required of his disciples abstinence and strict separation

from such unphilosophical allurements with such success that the

youthful tragic poet plato first of all burned his poems to be able to

become a scholar of socrates but where unconquerable native capacities

bore up against the socratic maxims their power together with the

momentum of his mighty character still sufficed to force poetry itself

into new and hitherto unknown channels
an instance of this is the aforesaid plato he who in the condemnation

of tragedy and of art in general certainly did not fall short of

the nave cynicism of his master was nevertheless constrained by

sheer artistic necessity to create a form of art which is inwardly

related even to the then existing forms of art which he repudiated

platos main objection to the old artthat it is the imitation of

a phantom19 and hence belongs to a sphere still lower than the

empiric worldcould not at all apply to the new art and so we find

plato endeavouring to go beyond reality and attempting to represent

the idea which underlies this pseudoreality but plato the thinker

thereby arrived by a roundabout road just at the point where he had

always been at home as poet and from which sophocles and all the old

artists had solemnly protested against that objection if tragedy

absorbed into itself all thepg 109 earlier varieties of art the same

could again be said in an unusual sense of platonic dialogue which

engendered by a mixture of all the then existing forms and styles

hovers midway between narrative lyric and drama between prose and

poetry and has also thereby broken loose from the older strict law

of unity of linguistic form a movement which was carried still

farther by the cynic writers who in the most promiscuous style

oscillating to and fro betwixt prose and metrical forms realised also

the literary picture of the raving socrates whom they were wont to

represent in life platonic dialogue was as it were the boat in which

the shipwrecked ancient poetry saved herself together with all her

children crowded into a narrow space and timidly obsequious to the

one steersman socrates they now launched into a new world which

never tired of looking at the fantastic spectacle of this procession

in very truth plato has given to all posterity the prototype of a new

form of art the prototype of the novel which must be designated as

the infinitely evolved sopian fable in which poetry holds the same

rank with reference to dialectic philosophy as this same philosophy

held for many centuries with reference to theology namely the rank of

ancilla this was the new position of poetry into which plato forced

it under the pressure of the demoninspired socrates
here philosophic thought overgrows art and compels it to cling close

to the trunk of dialectics the apollonian tendency has chrysalised

in the logical schematism just as something analogouspg 110 in the case

of euripides and moreover a translation of the dionysian into the

naturalistic emotion was forced upon our attention socrates the

dialectical hero in platonic drama reminds us of the kindred nature

of the euripidean hero who has to defend his actions by arguments and

counterarguments and thereby so often runs the risk of forfeiting

our tragic pity for who could mistake the optimistic element

in the essence of dialectics which celebrates a jubilee in every

conclusion and can breathe only in cool clearness and consciousness

the optimistic element which having once forced its way into tragedy

must gradually overgrow its dionysian regions and necessarily impel it

to selfdestructioneven to the deathleap into the bourgeois drama

let us but realise the consequences of the socratic maxims virtue is

knowledge man only sins from ignorance he who is virtuous is happy

these three fundamental forms of optimism involve the death of tragedy

for the virtuous hero must now be a dialectician there must now be a

necessary visible connection between virtue and knowledge between

belief and morality the transcendental justice of the plot in schylus

is now degraded to the superficial and audacious principle of poetic

justice with its usual deus ex machina
how does the chorus and in general the entire dionysomusical

substratum of tragedy now appear in the light of this new

socratooptimistic stageworld as something accidental as a readily

dispensable reminiscence of the originpg 111 of tragedy while we have

in fact seen that the chorus can be understood only as the cause of

tragedy and of the tragic generally this perplexity with respect to

the chorus first manifests itself in sophoclesan important sign that

the dionysian basis of tragedy already begins to disintegrate with

him he no longer ventures to entrust to the chorus the main share

of the effect but limits its sphere to such an extent that it now

appears almost coordinate with the actors just as if it were elevated

from the orchestra into the scene whereby of course its character

is completely destroyed notwithstanding that aristotle countenances

this very theory of the chorus this alteration of the position of

the chorus which sophocles at any rate recommended by his practice

and according to tradition even by a treatise is the first step

towards the annihilation of the chorus the phases of which follow

one another with alarming rapidity in euripides agathon and the new

comedy optimistic dialectics drives music out of tragedy with the

scourge of its syllogisms that is it destroys the essence of tragedy

which can be explained only as a manifestation and illustration of

dionysian states as the visible symbolisation of music as the

dreamworld of dionysian ecstasy
if therefore we are to assume an antidionysian tendency operating

even before socrates which received in him only an unprecedentedly

grand expression we must not shrink from the question as to what

a phenomenon like that of socrates indicates whom in view of thepg 112

platonic dialogues we are certainly not entitled to regard as a purely

disintegrating negative power and though there can be no doubt

whatever that the most immediate effect of the socratic impulse tended

to the dissolution of dionysian tragedy yet a profound experience of

socrates own life compels us to ask whether there is necessarily

only an antipodal relation between socratism and art and whether the

birth of an artistic socrates is in general something contradictory

in itself
for that despotic logician had now and then the feeling of a gap or

void a sentiment of semireproach as of a possibly neglected duty

with respect to art there often came to him as he tells his friends

in prison one and the same dreamapparition which kept constantly

repeating to him socrates practise music up to his very last days

he solaces himself with the opinion that his philosophising is the

highest form of poetry and finds it hard to believe that a deity will

remind him of the common popular music finally when in prison

he consents to practise also this despised music in order thoroughly

to unburden his conscience and in this frame of mind he composes

a poem on apollo and turns a few sopian fables into verse it was

something similar to the demonian warning voice which urged him to

these practices it was because of his apollonian insight that like a

barbaric king he did not understand the noble image of a god and was

in danger of sinning against a deitythrough ignorance the prompting

voice of the socraticpg 113 dreamvision is the only sign of doubtfulness

as to the limits of logical nature perhaps thus he had to ask

himselfwhat is not intelligible to me is not therefore unreasonable

perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is banished

perhaps art is even a necessary correlative of and supplement to

science

in the sense of these last portentous questions it must now be

indicated how the influence of socrates extending to the present

moment indeed to all futurity has spread over posterity like an

everincreasing shadow in the evening sun and how this influence

again and again necessitates a regeneration of artyea of art

already with metaphysical broadest and profoundest senseand its own

eternity guarantees also the eternity of art
before this could be perceived before the intrinsic dependence of

every art on the greeks the greeks from homer to socrates was

conclusively demonstrated it had to happen to us with regard to these

greeks as it happened to the athenians with regard to socrates nearly

every age and stage of culture has at some time or other sought with

deep displeasure to free itself from the greeks because in their

presence everything selfachieved sincerely admired and apparently

quite original seemed all of a sudden to lose life and colour

and shrink to an abortive copy even to caricature and so hearty

indignation breaks forth time after time againstpg 114 this presumptuous

little nation which dared to designate as barbaric for all time

everything not native who are they one asks ones self who though

they possessed only an ephemeral historical splendour ridiculously

restricted institutions a dubious excellence in their customs and

were even branded with ugly vices yet lay claim to the dignity and

singular position among the peoples to which genius is entitled among

the masses what a pity one has not been so fortunate as to find the

cup of hemlock with which such an affair could be disposed of without

ado for all the poison which envy calumny and rankling resentment

engendered within themselves have not sufficed to destroy that

selfsufficient grandeur and so one feels ashamed and afraid in the

presence of the greeks unless one prize truth above all things and

dare also to acknowledge to ones self this truth that the greeks

as charioteers hold in their hands the reins of our own and of

every culture but that almost always chariot and horses are of too

poor material and incommensurate with the glory of their guides who

then will deem it sport to run such a team into an abyss which they

themselves clear with the leap of achilles
in order to assign also to socrates the dignity of such a leading

position it will suffice to recognise in him the type of an unheardof

form of existence the type of the theoretical man with regard

to whose meaning and purpose it will be our next task to attain

an insight like the artist the theorist also finds an infinite

satisfaction inpg 115 what is and like the former he is shielded by this

satisfaction from the practical ethics of pessimism with its lynx eyes

which shine only in the dark for if the artist in every unveiling

of truth always cleaves with raptured eyes only to that which still

remains veiled after the unveiling the theoretical man on the other

hand enjoys and contents himself with the castoff veil and finds

the consummation of his pleasure in the process of a continuously

successful unveiling through his own unaided efforts there would

have been no science if it had only been concerned about that one

naked goddess and nothing else for then its disciples would have been

obliged to feel like those who purposed to dig a hole straight through

the earth each one of whom perceives that with the utmost lifelong

exertion he is able to excavate only a very little of the enormous

depth which is again filled up before his eyes by the labours of his

successor so that a third man seems to do well when on his own account

he selects a new spot for his attempts at tunnelling if now some one

proves conclusively that the antipodal goal cannot be attained in this

direct way who will still care to toil on in the old depths unless he

has learned to content himself in the meantime with finding precious

stones or discovering natural laws for that reason lessing the most

honest theoretical man ventured to say that he cared more for the

search after truth than for truth itself in saying which he revealed

the fundamental secret of science to the astonishment and indeed

to the vexation of scientific men wellpg 116 to be sure there stands

alongside of this detached perception as an excess of honesty if not

of presumption a profound illusion which first came to the world

in the person of socrates the imperturbable belief that by means

of the clue of causality thinking reaches to the deepest abysses of

being and that thinking is able not only to perceive being but even

to correct it this sublime metaphysical illusion is added as an

instinct to science and again and again leads the latter to its limits

where it must change into art which is really the end to be attained

by this mechanism
if we now look at socrates in the light of this thought he appears to

us as the first who could not only live butwhat is far morealso

die under the guidance of this instinct of science and hence the

picture of the dying socrates as the man delivered from the fear of

death by knowledge and argument is the escutcheon above the entrance

to science which reminds every one of its mission namely to make

existence appear to be comprehensible and therefore to be justified

for which purpose if arguments do not suffice myth also must be

used which i just now designated even as the necessary consequence

yea as the end of science
he who once makes intelligible to himself how after the death of

socrates the mystagogue of science one philosophical school succeeds

another like wave upon wavehow an entirely unforeshadowed

universal development of the thirst for knowledge in the widest

compass of the cultured world and as the specific task for every

onepg 117 highly gifted led science on to the high sea from which since

then it has never again been able to be completely ousted how

through the universality of this movement a common net of thought

was first stretched over the entire globe with prospects moreover

of conformity to law in an entire solar systemhe who realises all

this together with the amazingly high pyramid of our presentday

knowledge cannot fail to see in socrates the turningpoint and vortex

of socalled universal history for if one were to imagine the whole

incalculable sum of energy which has been used up by that universal

tendencyemployed not in the service of knowledge but for the

practical ie egoistical ends of individuals and peoplesthen

probably the instinctive love of life would be so much weakened in

universal wars of destruction and incessant migrations of peoples

that owing to the practice of suicide the individual would perhaps

feel the last remnant of a sense of duty when like the native of

the fiji islands as son he strangles his parents and as friend his

friend a practical pessimism which might even give rise to a horrible

ethics of general slaughter out of pitywhich for the rest exists

and has existed wherever art in one form or another especially as

science and religion has not appeared as a remedy and preventive of

that pestilential breath
in view of this practical pessimism socrates is the archetype of

the theoretical optimist who in the aboveindicated belief in the

fathomableness of the nature of things attributes to knowledge and

perception the power of a universal medicine andpg 118 sees in error and

evil to penetrate into the depths of the nature of things and to

separate true perception from error and illusion appeared to the

socratic man the noblest and even the only truly human calling just as

from the time of socrates onwards the mechanism of concepts judgments

and inferences was prized above all other capacities as the highest

activity and the most admirable gift of nature even the sublimest

moral acts the stirrings of pity of selfsacrifice of heroism

and that tranquillity of soul so difficult of attainment which the

apollonian greek called sophrosyne were derived by socrates and his

likeminded successors up to the present day from the dialectics of

knowledge and were accordingly designated as teachable he who has

experienced in himself the joy of a socratic perception and felt how

it seeks to embrace in constantly widening circles the entire world

of phenomena will thenceforth find no stimulus which could urge him

to existence more forcible than the desire to complete that conquest

and to knit the net impenetrably close to a person thus minded the

platonic socrates then appears as the teacher of an entirely new form

of greek cheerfulness and felicity of existence which seeks to

discharge itself in actions and will find its discharge for the most

part in maieutic and pedagogic influences on noble youths with a view

to the ultimate production of genius
but now science spurred on by its powerful illusion hastens

irresistibly to its limits on which its optimism hidden in the

essence of logic is wrecked for the periphery of the circle ofpg 119

science has an infinite number of points and while there is still no

telling how this circle can ever be completely measured yet the noble

and gifted man even before the middle of his career inevitably comes

into contact with those extreme points of the periphery where he stares

at the inexplicable when he here sees to his dismay how logic coils

round itself at these limits and finally bites its own tailthen the

new form of perception discloses itself namely tragic perception

which in order even to be endured requires art as a safeguard and

remedy
if with eyes strengthened and refreshed at the sight of the greeks we

look upon the highest spheres of the world that surrounds us we behold

the avidity of the insatiate optimistic knowledge of which socrates is

the typical representative transformed into tragic resignation and the

need of art while to be sure this same avidity in its lower stages

has to exhibit itself as antagonistic to art and must especially have

an inward detestation of dionysotragic art as was exemplified in the

opposition of socratism to schylean tragedy
here then with agitated spirit we knock at the gates of the present and

the future will that transforming lead to ever new configurations

of genius and especially of the musicpractising socrates will the

net of art which is spread over existence whether under the name of

religion or of science be knit always more closely and delicately

or is it destined to be torn to shreds under the restlessly barbaric

activity and whirl which is called the present dayanxiouspg 120 yet

not disconsolate we stand aloof for a little while as the spectators

who are permitted to be witnesses of these tremendous struggles and

transitions alas it is the charm of these struggles that he who

beholds them must also fight them
16
by this elaborate historical example we have endeavoured to make it

clear that tragedy perishes as surely by evanescence of the spirit of

music as it can be born only out of this spirit in order to qualify

the singularity of this assertion and on the other hand to disclose

the source of this insight of ours we must now confront with clear

vision the analogous phenomena of the present time we must enter

into the midst of these struggles which as i said just now are

being carried on in the highest spheres of our present world between

the insatiate optimistic perception and the tragic need of art in

so doing i shall leave out of consideration all other antagonistic

tendencies which at all times oppose art especially tragedy and which

at present again extend their sway triumphantly to such an extent that

of the theatrical arts only the farce and the ballet for example put

forth their blossoms which perhaps not every one cares to smell in

tolerably rich luxuriance i will speak only of the most illustrious

opposition to the tragic conception of thingsand by this i mean

essentially optimistic science with its ancestor socrates at the head

of it presently also the forces will be designatedpg 121 which seem to me

to guarantee a rebirth of tragedyand who knows what other blessed

hopes for the german genius
before we plunge into the midst of these struggles let us array

ourselves in the armour of our hitherto acquired knowledge in

contrast to all those who are intent on deriving the arts from one

exclusive principle as the necessary vital source of every work of

art i keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic deities of the greeks

apollo and dionysus and recognise in them the living and conspicuous

representatives of two worlds of art which differ in their intrinsic

essence and in their highest aims apollo stands before me as the

transfiguring genius of the principium individuationis through

which alone the redemption in appearance is to be truly attained

while by the mystical cheer of dionysus the spell of individuation

is broken and the way lies open to the mothers of being20 to the

innermost heart of things this extraordinary antithesis which opens

up yawningly between plastic art as the apollonian and music as the

dionysian art has become manifest to only one of the great thinkers

to such an extent that even without this key to the symbolism of the

hellenic divinities he allowed to music a different character and

origin in advance of all the other arts because unlike them it is

not a copy of the phenomenon but a direct copy of the will itself and

therefore represents the metaphysical of everything physical in thepg 122

world the thinginitself of every phenomenon schopenhauer welt

als wille und vorstellung i 310 to this most important perception

of sthetics with which taken in a serious sense sthetics properly

commences richard wagner by way of confirmation of its eternal

truth affixed his seal when he asserted in his beethoven that

music must be judged according to sthetic principles quite different

from those which apply to the plastic arts and not in general

according to the category of beauty although an erroneous sthetics

inspired by a misled and degenerate art has by virtue of the concept

of beauty prevailing in the plastic domain accustomed itself to demand

of music an effect analogous to that of the works of plastic art

namely the suscitating delight in beautiful forms upon perceiving

this extraordinary antithesis i felt a strong inducement to approach

the essence of greek tragedy and by means of it the profoundest

revelation of hellenic genius for i at last thought myself to be in

possession of a charm to enable mefar beyond the phraseology of our

usual stheticsto represent vividly to my mind the primitive problem

of tragedy whereby such an astounding insight into the hellenic

character was afforded me that it necessarily seemed as if our proudly

comporting classicohellenic science had thus far contrived to subsist

almost exclusively on phantasmagoria and externalities
perhaps we may lead up to this primitive problem with the question

what sthetic effect results when the intrinsically separate

artpowerspg 123 the apollonian and the dionysian enter into concurrent

actions or in briefer form how is music related to image and

conceptschopenhauer whom richard wagner with especial reference to

this point accredits with an unsurpassable clearness and perspicuity

of exposition expresses himself most copiously on the subject in

the following passage which i shall cite here at full length21

welt als wille und vorstellung i p 309 according to all

this we may regard the phenomenal world or nature and music as

two different expressions of the same thing20 which is therefore

itself the only medium of the analogy between these two expressions

so that a knowledge of this medium is required in order to understand

that analogy music therefore if regarded as an expression of the

world is in the highest degree a universal language which is related

indeed to the universality of concepts much as these are related to

the particular things its universality however is by no means the

empty universality of abstraction but of quite a different kind and

is united with thorough and distinct definiteness in this respect it

resembles geometrical figures and numbers which are the universal

forms of all possible objiects of experience and applicable to them all

a priori and yet are not abstract but perceptiple and thoroughly

determinate all possible efforts excitementspg 124 and manifestations of

will all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in

the wide negative concept of feeling may be expressed by the infinite

number of possible melodies but always in the universality of mere

form without the material always according to the thinginitself

not the phenomenonof which they reproduce the very soul and essence

as it were without the body this deep relation which music bears to

the true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable

music played to any scene action event or surrounding seems to

disclose to us its most secret meaning and appears as the most

accurate and distinct commentary upon it as also the fact that whoever

gives himself up entirely to the impression of a symphony seems to see

all the possible events of life and the world take place in himself

nevertheless upon reflection he can find no likeness between the music

and the things that passed before his mind for as we have said music

is distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a

copy of the phenomenon or more accurately the adequate objectivity

of the will but the direct copy of the will itself and therefore

represents the metaphysical of everything physical in the world and

the thinginitself of every phenomenon we might therefore just as

well call the world embodied music as embodied will and this is the

reason why music makes every picture and indeed every scene of real

life and of the world at once appear with higher significance all the

more so to be sure in proportion as itspg 125 melody is analogous to the

inner spirit of the given phenomenon it rests upon this that we are

able to set a poem to music as a song or a perceptible representation

as a pantomime or both as an opera such particular pictures of human

life set to the universal language of music are never bound to it

or correspond to it with stringent necessity but stand to it only

in the relation of an example chosen at will to a general concept

in the determinateness of the real they represent that which music

expresses in the universality of mere form for melodies are to a

certain extent like general concepts an abstraction from the actual

this actual world then the world of particular things affords the

object of perception the special and the individual the particular

case both to the universality of concepts and to the universality of

the melodies but these two universalities are in a certain respect

opposed to each other for the concepts contain only the forms which

are first of all abstracted from perceptionthe separated outward

shell of things as it wereand hence they are in the strictest

sense of the term abstracta music on the other hand gives the

inmost kernel which precedes all forms or the heart of things this

relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen

by saying the concepts are the universalia post rem but music gives

the universalia ante rem and the real world the universalia in

rebut that in general a relation is possible between a composition

and a perceptible representation rests as we have said upon thepg 126

fact that both are simply different expressions of the same inner

being of the world when now in the particular case such a relation

is actually given that is to say when the composer has been able to

express in the universal language of music the emotions of will which

constitute the heart of an event then the melody of the song the

music of the opera is expressive but the analogy discovered by the

composer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge

of the nature of the world unknown to his reason and must not be an

imitation produced with conscious intention by means of conceptions

otherwise the music does not express the inner nature of the will

itself but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its phenomenon all

specially imitative music does this
we have therefore according to the doctrine of schopenhauer an

immediate understanding of music as the language of the will and

feel our imagination stimulated to give form to this invisible and

yet so actively stirred spiritworld which speaks to us and prompted

to embody it in an analogous example on the other hand image and

concept under the influence of a truly conformable music acquire a

higher significance dionysian art therefore is wont to exercisetwo

kinds of influences on the apollonian artfaculty music firstly

incites to the symbolic intuition of dionysian universality and

secondly it causes the symbolic image to stand forth in its fullest

significance from these facts intelligible in themselves and not

inaccessible to profounder observationpg 127 i infer the capacity of music

to give birth to myth that is to say the most significant exemplar

and precisely tragic myth the myth which speaks of dionysian

knowledge in symbols in the phenomenon of the lyrist i have set forth

that in him music strives to express itself with regard to its nature

in apollonian images if now we reflect that music in its highest

potency must seek to attain also to its highest symbolisation we must

deem it possible that it also knows how to find the symbolic expression

of its inherent dionysian wisdom and where shall we have to seek for

this expression if not in tragedy and in general in the conception of

the tragic
from the nature of art as it is ordinarily conceived according to

the single category of appearance and beauty the tragic cannot be

honestly deduced at all it is only through the spirit of music that

we understand the joy in the annihilation of the individual for in

the particular examples of such annihilation only is the eternal

phenomenon of dionysian art made clear to us which gives expression

to the will in its omnipotence as it were behind the principium

individuationis the eternal life beyond all phenomena and in

spite of all annihilation the metaphysical delight in the tragic

is a translation of the instinctively unconscious dionysian wisdom

into the language of the scene the hero the highest manifestation

of the will is disavowed for our pleasure because he is only

phenomenon and because the eternal life of the will is not affected

by his annihilation we believe in eternal lifepg 128 tragedy exclaims

while music is the proximate idea of this life plastic art has an

altogether different object here apollo vanquishes the suffering of

the individual by the radiant glorification of the eternity of the

phenomenon here beauty triumphs over the suffering inherent in life

pain is in a manner surreptitiously obliterated from the features of

nature in dionysian art and its tragic symbolism the same nature

speaks to us with its true undissembled voice be as i am amidst the

ceaseless change of phenomena the eternally creative primordial mother

eternally impelling to existence selfsatisfying eternally with this

change of phenomena

21 that is the will as understood by schopenhauertr
17
dionysian art too seeks to convince us of the eternal joy of

existence only we are to seek this joy not in phenomena but behind

phenomena we are to perceive how all that comes into being must be

ready for a sorrowful end we are compelled to look into the terrors of

individual existenceyet we are not to become torpid a metaphysical

comfort tears us momentarily from the bustle of the transforming

figures we are really for brief moments primordial being itself

and feel its indomitable desire for being and joy in existence the

struggle the pain the destruction of phenomena now appear to us as

something necessary considering the surplus of innumerable forms of

existence which throng and push one another into life considering

the exuberant fertility of the universal will we are pierced by the

maddening sting ofpg 129 these pains at the very moment when we have become

as it were one with the immeasurable primordial joy in existence

and when we anticipate in dionysian ecstasy the indestructibility

and eternity of this joy in spite of fear and pity we are the happy

living beings not as individuals but as the one living being with

whose procreative joy we are blended
the history of the rise of greek tragedy now tells us with luminous

precision that the tragic art of the greeks was really born of the

spirit of music with which conception we believe we have done justice

for the first time to the original and most astonishing significance of

the chorus at the same time however we must admit that the import of

tragic myth as set forth above never became transparent with sufficient

lucidity to the greek poets let alone the greek philosophers their

heroes speak as it were more superficially than they act the myth

does not at all find its adequate objectification in the spoken word

the structure of the scenes and the conspicuous images reveal a deeper

wisdom than the poet himself can put into words and concepts the same

being also observed in shakespeare whose hamlet for instance in an

analogous manner talks more superficially than he acts so that the

previously mentioned lesson of hamlet is to be gathered not from his

words but from a more profound contemplation and survey of the whole

with respect to greek tragedy which of course presents itself to us

only as worddrama i have even intimated that the incongruence between

myth and expression mightpg 130 easily tempt us to regard it as shallower

and less significant than it really is and accordingly to postulate

for it a more superficial effect than it must have had according to

the testimony of the ancients for how easily one forgets that what

the wordpoet did not succeed in doing namely realising the highest

spiritualisation and ideality of myth he might succeed in doing

every moment as creative musician we require to be sure almost by

philological method to reconstruct for ourselves the ascendency of

musical influence in order to receive something of the incomparable

comfort which must be characteristic of true tragedy even this musical

ascendency however would only have been felt by us as such had

we been greeks while in the entire development of greek musicas

compared with the infinitely richer music known and familiar to uswe

imagine we hear only the youthful song of the musical genius intoned

with a feeling of diffidence the greeks are as the egyptian priests

say eternal children and in tragic art also they are only children

who do not know what a sublime plaything has originated under their

hands andis being demolished
that striving of the spirit of music for symbolic and mythical

manifestation which increases from the beginnings of lyric poetry to

attic tragedy breaks off all of a sudden immediately after attaining

luxuriant development and disappears as it were from the surface

of hellenic art while the dionysian view of things born of this

striving lives on in mysteries and in its strangest metamorphosespg 131 and

debasements does not cease to attract earnest natures will it not one

day rise again as art out of its mystic depth
here the question occupies us whether the power by the counteracting

influence of which tragedy perished has for all time strength enough

to prevent the artistic reawaking of tragedy and of the tragic view

of things if ancient tragedy was driven from its course by the

dialectical desire for knowledge and the optimism of science it might

be inferred that there is an eternal conflict between the theoretic

and the tragic view of things and only after the spirit of science

has been led to its boundaries and its claim to universal validity

has been destroyed by the evidence of these boundaries can we hope

for a rebirth of tragedy for which form of culture we should have to

use the symbol of the musicpractising socrates in the sense spoken

of above in this contrast i understand by the spirit of science the

belief which first came to light in the person of socratesthe belief

in the fathomableness of nature and in knowledge as a panacea
he who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly

onwardpressing spirit of science will realise at once that myth

was annihilated by it and that in consequence of this annihilation

poetry was driven as a homeless being from her natural ideal soil

if we have rightly assigned to music the capacity to reproduce myth

from itself we may in turn expect to find the spirit of science on

the path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic power of music

this takes place in the development of the new attic dithyramb the

music ofpg 132 which no longer expressed the inner essence the will itself

but only rendered the phenomenon insufficiently in an imitation by

means of concepts from which intrinsically degenerate music the truly

musical natures turned away with the same repugnance that they felt

for the artdestroying tendency of socrates the unerring instinct of

aristophanes surely did the proper thing when it comprised socrates

himself the tragedy of euripides and the music of the new dithyrambic

poets in the same feeling of hatred and perceived in all three

phenomena the symptoms of a degenerate culture by this new dithyramb

music has in an outrageous manner been made the imitative portrait of

phenomena for instance of a battle or a storm at sea and has thus

of course been entirely deprived of its mythopoeic power for if it

endeavours to excite our delight only by compelling us to seek external

analogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical

figures and characteristic sounds of music if our understanding is

expected to satisfy itself with the perception of these analogies we

are reduced to a frame of mind in which the reception of the mythical

is impossible for the myth as a unique exemplar of generality

and truth towering into the infinite desires to be conspicuously

perceived the truly dionysean music presents itself to us as such

a general mirror of the universal will the conspicuous event which

is refracted in this mirror expands at once for our consciousness to

the copy of an eternal truth conversely such a conspicious event is

at once divested of every mythicalpg 133 character by the tonepainting

of the new dithyramb music has here become a wretched copy of the

phenomenon and therefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself

through which poverty it still further reduces even the phenomenon for

our consciousness so that now for instance a musically imitated

battle of this sort exhausts itself in marches signalsounds etc

and our imagination is arrested precisely by these superficialities

tonepainting is therefore in every respect the counterpart of true

music with its mythopoeic power through it the phenomenon poor in

itself is made still poorer while through an isolated dionysian music

the phenomenon is evolved and expanded into a picture of the world

it was an immense triumph of the nondionysian spirit when in the

development of the new dithyramb it had estranged music from itself

and reduced it to be the slave of phenomena euripides who albeit in

a higher sense must be designated as a thoroughly unmusical nature

is for this very reason a passionate adherent of the new dithyrambic

music and with the liberality of a freebooter employs all its

effective turns and mannerisms
in another direction also we see at work the power of this

undionysian mythopposing spirit when we turn our eyes to the

prevalence of character representation and psychological refinement

from sophocles onwards the character must no longer be expanded into

an eternal type but on the contrary must operate individually

through artistic bytraits and shadings through the nicest precision

of all lines in such a mannerpg 134 that the spectator is in general no

longer conscious of the myth but of the mighty naturemyth and the

imitative power of the artist here also we observe the victory of

the phenomenon over the universal and the delight in the particular

quasianatomical preparation we actually breathe the air of a

theoretical world in which scientific knowledge is valued more highly

than the artistic reflection of a universal law the movement along

the line of the representation of character proceeds rapidly while

sophocles still delineates complete characters and employs myth for

their refined development euripides already delineates only prominent

individual traits of character which can express themselves in violent

bursts of passion in the new attic comedy however there are only

masks with one expression frivolous old men duped panders and

cunning slaves in untiring repetition where now is the mythopoeic

spirit of music what is still left now of music is either excitatory

music or souvenir music that is either a stimulant for dull and

usedup nerves or tonepainting as regards the former it hardly

matters about the text set to it the heroes and choruses of euripides

are already dissolute enough when once they begin to sing to what pass

must things have come with his brazen successors
the new undionysian spirit however manifests itself most clearly in

the dnouements of the new dramas in the old tragedy one could feel

at the close the metaphysical comfort without which the delight in

tragedy cannot be explained at all the conciliating tones from another

world sound purestpg 135 perhaps in the dipus at colonus now that the

genius of music has fled from tragedy tragedy is strictly speaking

dead for from whence could one now draw the metaphysical comfort one

sought therefore for an earthly unravelment of the tragic dissonance

the hero after he had been sufficiently tortured by fate reaped a

welldeserved reward through a superb marriage or divine tokens of

favour the hero had turned gladiator on whom after being liberally

battered about and covered with wounds freedom was occasionally

bestowed the deus ex machina took the place of metaphysical comfort

i will not say that the tragic view of things was everywhere completely

destroyed by the intruding spirit of the undionysian we only know

that it was compelled to flee from art into the underworld as it were

in the degenerate form of a secret cult over the widest extent of the

hellenic character however there raged the consuming blast of this

spirit which manifests itself in the form of greek cheerfulness

which we have already spoken of as a senile unproductive love of

existence this cheerfulness is the counterpart of the splendid

navet of the earlier greeks which according to the characteristic

indicated above must be conceived as the blossom of the apollonian

culture growing out of a dark abyss as the victory which the hellenic

will through its mirroring of beauty obtains over suffering and the

wisdom of suffering the noblest manifestation of that other form of

greek cheerfulness the alexandrine is the cheerfulness of the

theoretical man it exhibits the same symptomatic characteristics as

i have just inferredpg 136 concerning the spirit of the undionysianit

combats dionysian wisdom and art it seeks to dissolve myth it

substitutes for metaphysical comfort an earthly consonance in fact a

deus ex machina of its own namely the god of machines and crucibles

that is the powers of the genii of nature recognised and employed in

the service of higher egoism it believes in amending the world by

knowledge in guiding life by science and that it can really confine

the individual within a narrow sphere of solvable problems where he

cheerfully says to life i desire thee it is worth while to know

thee
18
it is an eternal phenomenon the avidious will can always by means

of an illusion spread over things detain its creatures in life

and compel them to live on one is chained by the socratic love of

knowledge and the vain hope of being able thereby to heal the eternal

wound of existence another is ensnared by arts seductive veil of

beauty fluttering before his eyes still another by the metaphysical

comfort that eternal life flows on indestructibly beneath the whirl of

phenomena to say nothing of the more ordinary and almost more powerful

illusions which the will has always at hand these three specimens of

illusion are on the whole designed only for the more nobly endowed

natures who in general feel profoundly the weight and burden of

existence and must be deluded into forgetfulness of their displeasure

by exquisite stimulants all that we call culture is made up of these

stimulantspg 137 and according to the proportion of the ingredients we

have either a specially socratic or artistic or tragic culture

or if historical exemplifications are wanted there is either an

alexandrine or a hellenic or a buddhistic culture
our whole modern world is entangled in the meshes of alexandrine

culture and recognises as its ideal the theorist equipped with

the most potent means of knowledge and labouring in the service of

science of whom the archetype and progenitor is socrates all our

educational methods have originally this ideal in view every other

form of existence must struggle onwards wearisomely beside it as

something tolerated but not intended in an almost alarming manner the

cultured man was here found for a long time only in the form of the

scholar even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from learned

imitations and in the main effect of the rhyme we still recognise the

origin of our poetic form from artistic experiments with a nonnative

and thoroughly learned language how unintelligible must faust the

modern cultured man who is in himself intelligible have appeared to a

true greekfaust storming discontentedly through all the faculties

devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge whom we

have only to place alongside of socrates for the purpose of comparison

in order to see that modern man begins to divine the boundaries of

this socratic love of perception and longs for a coast in the wide

waste of the ocean of knowledge when goethe on one occasion said to

eckermann with reference to napoleon yes my good friend there is

also a productiveness ofpg 138 deeds he reminded us in a charmingly nave

manner that the nontheorist is something incredible and astounding to

modern man so that the wisdom of goethe is needed once more in order

to discover that such a surprising form of existence is comprehensible

nay even pardonable
now we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the heart

of this socratic culture optimism deeming itself absolute well we

must not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripenif society

leavened to the very lowest strata by this kind of culture gradually

begins to tremble through wanton agitations and desires if the belief

in the earthly happiness of all if the belief in the possibility of

such a general intellectual culture is gradually transformed into the

threatening demand for such an alexandrine earthly happiness into

the conjuring of a euripidean deus ex machina let us mark this

well the alexandrine culture requires a slave class to be able to

exist permanently but in its optimistic view of life it denies the

necessity of such a class and consequently when the effect of its

beautifully seductive and tranquillising utterances about the dignity

of man and the dignity of labour is spent it gradually drifts

towards a dreadful destination there is nothing more terrible than

a barbaric slave class who have learned to regard their existence

as an injustice and now prepare to take vengeance not only for

themselves but for all generations in the face of such threatening

storms who dares to appeal with confident spirit to our pale and

exhausted religions which even in their foundations have degenerated

intopg 139 scholastic religionsso that myth the necessary prerequisite

of every religion is already paralysed everywhere and even in this

domain the optimistic spiritwhich we have just designated as the

annihilating germ of societyhas attained the mastery
while the evil slumbering in the heart of theoretical culture gradually

begins to disquiet modern man and makes him anxiously ransack the

stores of his experience for means to avert the danger though not

believing very much in these means while he therefore begins to

divine the consequences his position involves great universally

gifted natures have contrived with an incredible amount of thought to

make use of the apparatus of science itself in order to point out the

limits and the relativity of knowledge generally and thus definitely

to deny the claim of science to universal validity and universal ends

with which demonstration the illusory notion was for the first time

recognised as such which pretends with the aid of causality to be

able to fathom the innermost essence of things the extraordinary

courage and wisdom of kant and schopenhauer have succeeded in

gaining the most difficult victory the victory over the optimism

hidden in the essence of logic which optimism in turn is the basis of

our culture while this optimism resting on apparently unobjectionable

terna veritates believed in the intelligibility and solvability of

all the riddles of the world and treated space time and causality

as totally unconditioned laws of the most universal validity kant on

the other hand showed that these served in reality only to elevate the

merepg 140 phenomenon the work of my to the sole and highest reality

putting it in place of the innermost and true essence of things thus

making the actual knowledge of this essence impossible that is

according to the expression of schopenhauer to lull the dreamer still

more soundly asleep welt als wille und vorstellung i 498 with

this knowledge a culture is inaugurated which i venture to designate as

a tragic culture the most important characteristic of which is that

wisdom takes the place of science as the highest endwisdom which

uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences turns

with unmoved eye to the comprehensive view of the world and seeks to

apprehend therein the eternal suffering as its own with sympathetic

feelings of love let us imagine a rising generation with this

undauntedness of vision with this heroic desire for the prodigious

let us imagine the bold step of these dragonslayers the proud and

daring spirit with which they turn their backs on all the effeminate

doctrines of optimism in order to live resolutely in the whole and in

the full would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture

with his selfdiscipline to earnestness and terror to desire a new

art the art of metaphysical comfortnamely tragedy as the hellena

belonging to him and that he should exclaim with faust


und sollt ich nicht sehnschtigster gewalt

ins leben ziehn die einzigste gestalt21

pg 141
but now that the socratic culture has been shaken from two directions

and is only able to hold the sceptre of its infallibility with

trembling handsonce by the fear of its own conclusions which it at

length begins to surmise and again because it is no longer convinced

with its former nave trust of the eternal validity of its foundation

it is a sad spectacle to behold how the dance of its thought always

rushes longingly on new forms to embrace them and then shuddering

lets them go of a sudden as mephistopheles does the seductive lami

it is certainly the symptom of the breach which all are wont to speak

of as the primordial suffering of modern culture that the theoretical

man alarmed and dissatisfied at his own conclusions no longer dares

to entrust himself to the terrible icestream of existence he runs

timidly up and down the bank he no longer wants to have anything

entire with all the natural cruelty of things so thoroughly has he

been spoiled by his optimistic contemplation besides he feels that

a culture built up on the principles of science must perish when it

begins to grow illogical that is to avoid its own conclusions

our art reveals this universal trouble in vain does one seek help by

imitating all the great productive periods and natures in vain does

one accumulate the entire worldliterature around modern man for

his comfort in vain does one place ones self in the midst of the

artstyles and artists of all ages so that one may give names to them

as adam did to the beasts one still continues the eternal hungerer

the critic without joy and energy thepg 142 alexandrine man who is in

the main a librarian and corrector of proofs and who pitiable wretch

goes blind from the dust of books and printers errors

we cannot designate the intrinsic substance of socratic culture more

distinctly than by calling it the culture of the opera for it is in

this department that culture has expressed itself with special navet

concerning its aims and perceptions which is sufficiently surprising

when we compare the genesis of the opera and the facts of operatic

development with the eternal truths of the apollonian and dionysian

i call to mind first of all the origin of the stilo rappresentativo

and the recitative is it credible that this thoroughly externalised

operatic music incapable of devotion could be received and cherished

with enthusiastic favour as a rebirth as it were of all true music

by the very age in which the ineffably sublime and sacred music of

palestrina had originated and who on the other hand would think of

making only the diversioncraving luxuriousness of those florentine

circles and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the

love of the opera which spread with such rapidity that in the same

age even among the same people this passion for a halfmusical

mode of speech should awaken alongside of the vaulted structure

of palestrine harmonies which the entire christian middle age had

been building up i can explainpg 143 to myself only by a cooperating

extraartistic tendency in the essence of the recitative
the listener who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the

music has his wishes met by the singer in that he speaks rather than

sings and intensifies the pathetic expression of the words in this

halfsong by this intensification of the pathos he facilitates the

understanding of the words and surmounts the remaining half of the

music the specific danger which now threatens him is that in some

unguarded moment he may give undue importance to music which would

forthwith result in the destruction of the pathos of the speech and

the distinctness of the words while on the other hand he always

feels himself impelled to musical delivery and to virtuose exhibition

of vocal talent here the poet comes to his aid who knows how to

provide him with abundant opportunities for lyrical interjections

repetitions of words and sentences etcat which places the singer

now in the purely musical element can rest himself without minding the

words this alternation of emotionally impressive yet only halfsung

speech and wholly sung interjections which is characteristic of the

stilo rappresentativo this rapidly changing endeavour to operate

now on the conceptional and representative faculty of the hearer now

on his musical sense is something so thoroughly unnatural and withal

so intrinsically contradictory both to the apollonian and dionysian

artistic impulses that one has to infer an origin of the recitative

foreign to all artistic instincts thepg 144 recitative must be defined

according to this description as the combination of epic and lyric

delivery not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which

could not be attained in the case of such totally disparate elements

but an entirely superficial mosaic conglutination such as is totally

unprecedented in the domain of nature and experience but this was

not the opinion of the inventors of the recitative they themselves

and their age with them believed rather that the mystery of antique

music had been solved by this stilo rappresentativo in which as

they thought the only explanation of the enormous influence of an

orpheus an amphion and even of greek tragedy was to be found the new

style was regarded by them as the reawakening of the most effective

music the old greek music indeed with the universal and popular

conception of the homeric world as the primitive world they could

abandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into the

paradisiac beginnings of mankind wherein music also must needs have

had the unsurpassed purity power and innocence of which the poets

could give such touching accounts in their pastoral plays here we see

into the internal process of development of this thoroughly modern

variety of art the opera a powerful need here acquires an art but

it is a need of an unsthetic kind the yearning for the idyll the

belief in the prehistoric existence of the artistic good man the

recitative was regarded as the rediscovered language of this primitive

man the opera as the recovered land of thispg 145 idyllically or heroically

good creature who in every action follows at the same time a natural

artistic impulse who sings a little along with all he has to say in

order to sing immediately with full voice on the slightest emotional

excitement it is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists

of those days combated the old ecclesiastical representation of man

as naturally corrupt and lost with this newcreated picture of the

paradisiac artist so that opera may be understood as the oppositional

dogma of the good man whereby however a solace was at the same time

found for the pessimism to which precisely the seriouslydisposed

men of that time were most strongly incited owing to the frightful

uncertainty of all conditions of life it is enough to have perceived

that the intrinsic charm and therefore the genesis of this new form

of art lies in the gratification of an altogether unsthetic need in

the optimistic glorification of man as such in the conception of the

primitive man as the man naturally good and artistic a principle of

the opera which has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible

demand which in face of the socialistic movements of the present

time we can no longer ignore the good primitive man wants his

rights what paradisiac prospects
i here place by way of parallel still another equally obvious

confirmation of my view that opera is built up on the same principles

as our alexandrine culture opera is the birth of the theoretical man

of the critical layman not of the artist one of the most surprising

facts in thepg 146 whole history of art it was the demand of thoroughly

unmusical hearers that the words must above all be understood so

that according to them a rebirth of music is only to be expected

when some mode of singing has been discovered in which the textword

lords over the counterpoint as the master over the servant for the

words it is argued are as much nobler than the accompanying harmonic

system as the soul is nobler than the body it was in accordance with

the laically unmusical crudeness of these views that the combination

of music picture and expression was effected in the beginnings of

the opera in the spirit of this sthetics the first experiments

were also made in the leading laic circles of florence by the poets

and singers patronised there the man incapable of art creates for

himself a species of art precisely because he is the inartistic man

as such because he does not divine the dionysian depth of music he

changes his musical taste into appreciation of the understandable

wordandtonerhetoric of the passions in the stilo rappresentativo

and into the voluptuousness of the arts of song because he is unable

to behold a vision he forces the machinist and the decorative artist

into his service because he cannot apprehend the true nature of the

artist he conjures up the artistic primitive man to suit his taste

that is the man who sings and recites verses under the influence

of passion he dreams himself into a time when passion suffices to

generate songs and poems as if emotion had ever been able to create

anything artistic the postulate of the opera is a falsepg 147 belief

concerning the artistic process in fact the idyllic belief that every

sentient man is an artist in the sense of this belief opera is the

expression of the taste of the laity in art who dictate their laws

with the cheerful optimism of the theorist
should we desire to unite in one the two conceptions just set forth

as influential in the origin of opera it would only remain for us to

speak of an idyllic tendency of the opera in which connection we

may avail ourselves exclusively of the phraseology and illustration of

schiller22 nature and the ideal he says are either objects of

grief when the former is represented as lost the latter unattained

or both are objects of joy in that they are represented as real

the first case furnishes the elegy in its narrower signification

the second the idyll in its widest sense here we must at once call

attention to the common characteristic of these two conceptions in

operatic genesis namely that in them the ideal is not regarded as

unattained or nature as lost agreeably to this sentiment there was

a primitive age of man when he lay close to the heart of nature

and owing to this naturalness had attained the ideal of mankind in

a paradisiac goodness and artistorganisation from which perfect

primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended whose faithful

copy we were in fact still said to be only we had to cast off some

few things in order to recognise ourselves once more as this primitive

man on the strength of a voluntary renunciation of superfluous

learnedness of superabundantpg 148 culture it was to such a concord of

nature and the ideal to an idyllic reality that the cultured man

of the renaissance suffered himself to be led back by his operatic

imitation of greek tragedy he made use of this tragedy as dante made

use of vergil in order to be led up to the gates of paradise while

from this point he went on without assistance and passed over from an

imitation of the highest form of greek art to a restoration of all

things to an imitation of mans original artworld what delightfully

nave hopefulness of these daring endeavours in the very heart of

theoretical culturesolely to be explained by the comforting belief

that maninhimself is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera

the eternally fluting or singing shepherd who must always in the end

rediscover himself as such if he has at any time really lost himself

solely the fruit of the optimism which here rises like a sweetishly

seductive column of vapour out of the depth of the socratic conception

of the world
the features of the opera therefore do not by any means exhibit the

elegiac sorrow of an eternal loss but rather the cheerfulness of

eternal rediscovery the indolent delight in an idyllic reality which

one can at least represent to ones self each moment as real and in

so doing one will perhaps surmise some day that this supposed reality

is nothing but a fantastically silly dawdling concerning which every

one who could judge it by the terrible earnestness of true nature

and compare it with the actual primitive scenes of the beginnings of

mankind would have to call out with loathing away withpg 149 the phantom

nevertheless one would err if one thought it possible to frighten

away merely by a vigorous shout such a dawdling thing as the opera

as if it were a spectre he who would destroy the opera must join

issue with alexandrine cheerfulness which expresses itself so navely

therein concerning its favourite representation of which in fact

it is the specific form of art but what is to be expected for art

itself from the operation of a form of art the beginnings of which

do not at all lie in the sthetic province which has rather stolen

over from a halfmoral sphere into the artistic domain and has been

able only now and then to delude us concerning this hybrid origin by

what sap is this parasitic operaconcern nourished if not by that

of true art must we not suppose that the highest and indeed the

truly serious task of artto free the eye from its glance into the

horrors of night and to deliver the subject by the healing balm of

appearance from the spasms of volitional agitationswill degenerate

under the influence of its idyllic seductions and alexandrine

adulation to an empty dissipating tendency to pastime what will

become of the eternal truths of the dionysian and apollonian in such

an amalgamation of styles as i have exhibited in the character of the

stilo rappresentativo where music is regarded as the servant the

text as the master where music is compared with the body the text

with the soul where at best the highest aim will be the realisation

of a paraphrastic tonepainting just as formerly in the new attic

dithyramb where music ispg 150 completely alienated from its true dignity

of being the dionysian mirror of the world so that the only thing

left to it is as a slave of phenomena to imitate the formal character

thereof and to excite an external pleasure in the play of lines and

proportions on close observation this fatal influence of the opera

on music is seen to coincide absolutely with the universal development

of modern music the optimism lurking in the genesis of the opera and

in the essence of culture represented thereby has with alarming

rapidity succeeded in divesting music of its dionysocosmic mission

and in impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character a

change with which perhaps only the metamorphosis of the schylean man

into the cheerful alexandrine man could be compared
if however in the exemplification herewith indicated we have rightly

associated the evanescence of the dionysian spirit with a most

striking but hitherto unexplained transformation and degeneration of

the hellenewhat hopes must revive in us when the most trustworthy

auspices guarantee the reverse process the gradual awakening of

the dionysian spirit in our modern world it is impossible for the

divine strength of herakles to languish for ever in voluptuous bondage

to omphale out of the dionysian root of the german spirit a power

has arisen which has nothing in common with the primitive conditions

of socratic culture and can neither be explained nor excused

thereby but is rather regarded by this culture as something terribly

inexplicable and overwhelmingly hostilemdashnamely german music as

we have to understandpg 151 it especially in its vast solar orbit from

bach to beethoven from beethoven to wagner what even under the most

favourable circumstances can the knowledgecraving socratism of our

days do with this demon rising from unfathomable depths neither by

means of the zigzag and arabesque work of operatic melody nor with

the aid of the arithmetical counting board of fugue and contrapuntal

dialectics is the formula to be found in the trebly powerful light23

of which one could subdue this demon and compel it to speak what

a spectacle when our sthetes with a net of beauty peculiar to

themselves now pursue and clutch at the genius of music romping

about before them with incomprehensible life and in so doing display

activities which are not to be judged by the standard of eternal beauty

any more than by the standard of the sublime let us but observe these

patrons of music as they are at close range when they call out so

indefatigably beauty beauty to discover whether they have the marks

of natures darling children who are fostered and fondled in the lap

of the beautiful or whether they do not rather seek a disguise for

their own rudeness an sthetical pretext for their own unemotional

insipidity i am thinking here for instance of otto jahn but let the

liar and the hypocrite beware of our german music for in the midst

of all our culture it is really the only genuine pure and purifying

firespirit from which and towards which as in the teaching of the

greatpg 152 heraclitus of ephesus all things move in a double orbitall

that we now call culture education civilisation must appear some day

before the unerring judge dionysus
let us recollect furthermore how kant and schopenhauer made it

possible for the spirit of german philosophy streaming from the

same sources to annihilate the satisfied delight in existence of

scientific socratism by the delimitation of the boundaries thereof how

through this delimitation an infinitely profounder and more serious

view of ethical problems and of art was inaugurated which we may

unhesitatingly designate as dionysian wisdom comprised in concepts

to what then does the mystery of this oneness of german music and

philosophy point if not to a new form of existence concerning the

substance of which we can only inform ourselves presentiently from

hellenic analogies for to us who stand on the boundary line between

two different forms of existence the hellenic prototype retains the

immeasurable value that therein all these transitions and struggles

are imprinted in a classically instructive form except that we as

it were experience analogically in reverse order the chief epochs

of the hellenic genius and seem now for instance to pass backwards

from the alexandrine age to the period of tragedy at the same time

we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age betokens only a

return to itself of the german spirit a blessed selfrediscovering

after excessive and urgent external influences have for a long time

compelled it living as it did inpg 153 helpless barbaric formlessness to

servitude under their form it may at last after returning to the

primitive source of its being venture to stalk along boldly and freely

before all nations without hugging the leadingstrings of a romanic

civilisation if only it can learn implicitly of one peoplethe

greeks of whom to learn at all is itself a high honour and a rare

distinction and when did we require these highest of all teachers more

than at present when we experience a rebirth of tragedy and are in

danger alike of not knowing whence it comes and of being unable to

make clear to ourselves whither it tends

it may be weighed some day before an impartial judge in what time and

in what men the german spirit has thus far striven most resolutely to

learn of the greeks and if we confidently assume that this unique

praise must be accorded to the noblest intellectual efforts of goethe

schiller and winkelmann it will certainly have to be added that

since their time and subsequently to the more immediate influences of

these efforts the endeavour to attain to culture and to the greeks by

this path has in an incomprehensible manner grown feebler and feebler

in order not to despair altogether of the german spirit must we not

infer therefrom that possibly in some essential matter even these

champions could not penetrate into the core of the hellenic nature

and were unable to establish a permanentpg 154 friendly alliance between

german and greek culture so that perhaps an unconscious perception

of this shortcoming might raise also in more serious minds the

disheartening doubt as to whether after such predecessors they could

advance still farther on this path of culture or could reach the goal

at all accordingly we see the opinions concerning the value of greek

contribution to culture degenerate since that time in the most alarming

manner the expression of compassionate superiority may be heard

in the most heterogeneous intellectual and nonintellectual camps

and elsewhere a totally ineffective declamation dallies with greek

harmony greek beauty greek cheerfulness and in the very circles

whose dignity it might be to draw indefatigably from the greek channel

for the good of german culture in the circles of the teachers in the

higher educational institutions they have learned best to compromise

with the greeks in good time and on easy terms to the extent often of

a sceptical abandonment of the hellenic ideal and a total perversion of

the true purpose of antiquarian studies if there be any one at all in

these circles who has not completely exhausted himself in the endeavour

to be a trustworthy corrector of old texts or a naturalhistory

microscopist of language he perhaps seeks also to appropriate grecian

antiquity historically along with other antiquities and in any case

according to the method and with the supercilious air of our present

cultured historiography when therefore the intrinsic efficiency

of the higher educationalpg 155 institutions has never perhaps been lower

or feebler than at present when the journalist the paper slave

of the day has triumphed over the academic teacher in all matters

pertaining to culture and there only remains to the latter the often

previously experienced metamorphosis of now fluttering also as a

cheerful cultured butterfly in the idiom of the journalist with the

light elegance peculiar theretowith what painful confusion must the

cultured persons of a period like the present gaze at the phenomenon

which can perhaps be comprehended analogically only by means of the

profoundest principle of the hitherto unintelligible hellenic genius

of the reawakening of the dionysian spirit and the rebirth of tragedy

never has there been another artperiod in which socalled culture

and true art have been so estranged and opposed as is so obviously

the case at present we understand why so feeble a culture hates true

art it fears destruction thereby but must not an entire domain of

culture namely the socraticalexandrine have exhausted its powers

after contriving to culminate in such a daintilytapering point as our

present culture when it was not permitted to heroes like goethe and

schiller to break open the enchanted gate which leads into the hellenic

magic mountain when with their most dauntless striving they did not

get beyond the longing gaze which the goethean iphigenia cast from

barbaric tauris to her home across the ocean what could the epigones

of such heroes hope for if the gate should not open to thempg 156 suddenly

of its own accord in an entirely different position quite overlooked

in all endeavours of culture hithertoamidst the mystic tones of

reawakened tragic music
let no one attempt to weaken our faith in an impending rebirth of

hellenic antiquity for in it alone we find our hope of a renovation

and purification of the german spirit through the firemagic of music

what else do we know of amidst the present desolation and languor

of culture which could awaken any comforting expectation for the

future we look in vain for one single vigorouslybranching root for

a speck of fertile and healthy soil there is dust sand torpidness

and languishing everywhere under such circumstances a cheerless

solitary wanderer could choose for himself no better symbol than the

knight with death and the devil as drer has sketched him for us the

mailclad knight grim and stern of visage who is able unperturbed

by his gruesome companions and yet hopelessly to pursue his terrible

path with horse and hound alone our schopenhauer was such a drerian

knight he was destitute of all hope but he sought the truth there is

not his equal
but how suddenly this gloomily depicted wilderness of our exhausted

culture changes when the dionysian magic touches it a hurricane

seizes everything decrepit decaying collapsed and stunted wraps

it whirlingly into a red cloud of dust and carries it like a vulture

into the air confused thereby our glances seek for what has vanished

for what they see is something risen topg 157 the golden light as from

a depression so full and green so luxuriantly alive so ardently

infinite tragedy sits in the midst of this exuberance of life

sorrow and joy in sublime ecstasy she listens to a distant doleful

songit tells of the mothers of being whose names are wahn wille

wehe21yes my friends believe with me in dionysian life and

in the rebirth of tragedy the time of the socratic man is past

crown yourselves with ivy take in your hands the thyrsus and do not

marvel if tigers and panthers lie down fawning at your feet dare now

to be tragic men for ye are to be redeemed ye are to accompany the

dionysian festive procession from india to greece equip yourselves for

severe conflict but believe in the wonders of your god
21
gliding back from these hortative tones into the mood which befits

the contemplative man i repeat that it can only be learnt from the

greeks what such a sudden and miraculous awakening of tragedy must

signify for the essential basis of a peoples life it is the people

of the tragic mysteries who fight the battles with the persians and

again the people who waged such wars required tragedy as a necessary

healing potion who would have imagined that there was still such a

uniformly powerful effusion of the simplest political sentiments the

most natural domesticpg 158 instincts and the primitive manly delight in

strife in this very people after it had been shaken to its foundations

for several generations by the most violent convulsions of the

dionysian demon if at every considerable spreading of the dionysian

commotion one always perceives that the dionysian loosing from the

shackles of the individual makes itself felt first of all in an

increased encroachment on the political instincts to the extent of

indifference yea even hostility it is certain on the other hand

that the stateforming apollo is also the genius of the principium

individuationis and that the state and domestic sentiment cannot live

without an assertion of individual personality there is only one way

from orgasm for a peoplethe way to indian buddhism which in order

to be at all endured with its longing for nothingness requires the

rare ecstatic states with their elevation above space time and the

individual just as these in turn demand a philosophy which teaches how

to overcome the indescribable depression of the intermediate states by

means of a fancy with the same necessity owing to the unconditional

dominance of political impulses a people drifts into a path of

extremest secularisation the most magnificent but also the most

terrible expression of which is the roman imperium
placed between india and rome and constrained to a seductive choice

the greeks succeeded in devising in classical purity still a third form

of life not indeed for long private use but just on that account for

immortality for itpg 159 holds true in all things that those whom the gods

love die young but on the other hand it holds equally true that they

then live eternally with the gods one must not demand of what is most

noble that it should possess the durable toughness of leather the

staunch durability which for instance was inherent in the national

character of the romans does not probably belong to the indispensable

predicates of perfection but if we ask by what physic it was possible

for the greeks in their best period notwithstanding the extraordinary

strength of their dionysian and political impulses neither to exhaust

themselves by ecstatic brooding nor by a consuming scramble for empire

and worldly honour but to attain the splendid mixture which we find

in a noble inflaming and contemplatively disposing wine we must

remember the enormous power of tragedy exciting purifying and

disburdening the entire life of a people the highest value of which

we shall divine only when as in the case of the greeks it appears

to us as the essence of all the prophylactic healing forces as the

mediator arbitrating between the strongest and most inherently fateful

characteristics of a people
tragedy absorbs the highest musical orgasm into itself so that it

absolutely brings music to perfection among the greeks as among

ourselves but it then places alongside thereof tragic myth and the

tragic hero who like a mighty titan takes the entire dionysian world

on his shoulders and disburdens us thereof while on the other hand

it is able by means of this same tragicpg 160 myth in the person of the

tragic hero to deliver us from the intense longing for this existence

and reminds us with warning hand of another existence and a higher

joy for which the struggling hero prepares himself presentiently by

his destruction not by his victories tragedy sets a sublime symbol

namely the myth between the universal authority of its music and the

receptive dionysian hearer and produces in him the illusion that music

is only the most effective means for the animation of the plastic world

of myth relying upon this noble illusion she can now move her limbs

for the dithyrambic dance and abandon herself unhesitatingly to an

orgiastic feeling of freedom in which she could not venture to indulge

as music itself without this illusion the myth protects us from the

music while on the other hand it alone gives the highest freedom

thereto by way of return for this service music imparts to tragic

myth such an impressive and convincing metaphysical significance as

could never be attained by word and image without this unique aid

and the tragic spectator in particular experiences thereby the sure

presentiment of supreme joy to which the path through destruction and

negation leads so that he thinks he hears as it were the innermost

abyss of things speaking audibly to him
if in these last propositions i have succeeded in giving perhaps only a

preliminary expression intelligible to few at first to this difficult

representation i must not here desist from stimulating my friends to a

further attempt orpg 161 cease from beseeching them to prepare themselves

by a detached example of our common experience for the perception of

the universal proposition in this example i must not appeal to those

who make use of the pictures of the scenic processes the words and the

emotions of the performers in order to approximate thereby to musical

perception for none of these speak music as their mothertongue

and in spite of the aids in question do not get farther than the

precincts of musical perception without ever being allowed to touch

its innermost shrines some of them like gervinus do not even reach

the precincts by this path i have only to address myself to those

who being immediately allied to music have it as it were for their

mothers lap and are connected with things almost exclusively by

unconscious musical relations i ask the question of these genuine

musicians whether they can imagine a man capable of hearing the third

act of tristan und isolde without any aid of word or scenery purely

as a vast symphonic period without expiring by a spasmodic distention

of all the wings of the soul a man who has thus so to speak put his

ear to the heartchamber of the cosmic will who feels the furious

desire for existence issuing therefrom as a thundering stream or most

gently dispersed brook into all the veins of the world would he not

collapse all at once could he endure in the wretched fragile tenement

of the human individual to hear the reecho of countless cries of

joy and sorrow from the vast void of cosmic night without flying

irresistiblypg 162 towards his primitive home at the sound of this pastoral

dancesong of metaphysics but if nevertheless such a work can be

heard as a whole without a renunciation of individual existence if

such a creation could be created without demolishing its creatorwhere

are we to get the solution of this contradiction
here there interpose between our highest musical excitement and the

music in question the tragic myth and the tragic heroin reality only

as symbols of the most universal facts of which music alone can speak

directly if however we felt as purely dionysian beings myth as a

symbol would stand by us absolutely ineffective and unnoticed and

would never for a moment prevent us from giving ear to the reecho of

the universalia ante rem here however the apollonian power with

a view to the restoration of the wellnigh shattered individual bursts

forth with the healing balm of a blissful illusion all of a sudden

we imagine we see only tristan motionless with hushed voice saying

to himself the old tune why does it wake me and what formerly

interested us like a hollow sigh from the heart of being seems now

only to tell us how waste and void is the sea and when breathless

we thought to expire by a convulsive distention of all our feelings

and only a slender tie bound us to our present existence we now hear

and see only the hero wounded to death and still not dying with his

despairing cry longing longing in dying still longing for longing

not dying and if formerly after such a surplus and superabundance of

consumingpg 163 agonies the jubilation of the born rent our hearts almost

like the very acme of agony the rejoicing kurwenal now stands between

us and the jubilation as such with face turned toward the ship which

carries isolde however powerfully fellowsuffering encroaches upon us

it nevertheless delivers us in a manner from the primordial suffering

of the world just as the symbolimage of the myth delivers us from the

immediate perception of the highest cosmic idea just as the thought

and word deliver us from the unchecked effusion of the unconscious

will the glorious apollonian illusion makes it appear as if the very

realm of tones presented itself to us as a plastic cosmos as if even

the fate of tristan and isolde had been merely formed and moulded

therein as out of some most delicate and impressible material
thus does the apollonian wrest us from dionysian universality and fill

us with rapture for individuals to these it rivets our sympathetic

emotion through these it satisfies the sense of beauty which longs for

great and sublime forms it brings before us biographical portraits

and incites us to a thoughtful apprehension of the essence of life

contained therein with the immense potency of the image the concept

the ethical teaching and the sympathetic emotionthe apollonian

influence uplifts man from his orgiastic selfannihilation and

beguiles him concerning the universality of the dionysian process

into the belief that he is seeing a detached picture of the world

for instance tristan and isoldepg 164 and that through music he will

be enabled to see it still more clearly and intrinsically what can

the healing magic of apollo not accomplish when it can even excite in

us the illusion that the dionysian is actually in the service of the

apollonian the effects of which it is capable of enhancing yea that

music is essentially the representative art for an apollonian substance
with the preestablished harmony which obtains between perfect drama

and its music the drama attains the highest degree of conspicuousness

such as is usually unattainable in mere spoken drama as all the

animated figures of the scene in the independently evolved lines

of melody simplify themselves before us to the distinctness of the

catenary curve the coexistence of these lines is also audible in the

harmonic change which sympathises in a most delicate manner with the

evolved process through which change the relations of things become

immediately perceptible to us in a sensible and not at all abstract

manner as we likewise perceive thereby that it is only in these

relations that the essence of a character and of a line of melody

manifests itself clearly and while music thus compels us to see more

extensively and more intrinsically than usual and makes us spread out

the curtain of the scene before ourselves like some delicate texture

the world of the stage is as infinitely expanded for our spiritualised

introspective eye as it is illumined outwardly from within how can

the wordpoet furnish anything analogous who strives to attain this

internalpg 165 expansion and illumination of the visible stageworld by a

much more imperfect mechanism and an indirect path proceeding as he

does from word and concept albeit musical tragedy likewise avails

itself of the word it is at the same time able to place alongside

thereof its basis and source and can make the unfolding of the word

from within outwards obvious to us
of the process just set forth however it could still be said

as decidedly that it is only a glorious appearance namely the

aforementioned apollonian illusion through the influence of which

we are to be delivered from the dionysian obtrusion and excess

in point of fact the relation of music to drama is precisely the

reverse music is the adequate idea of the world drama is but the

reflex of this idea a detached umbrage thereof the identity between

the line of melody and the lining form between the harmony and the

characterrelations of this form is true in a sense antithetical to

what one would suppose on the contemplation of musical tragedy we

may agitate and enliven the form in the most conspicuous manner and

enlighten it from within but it still continues merely phenomenon

from which there is no bridge to lead us into the true reality into

the heart of the world music however speaks out of this heart and

though countless phenomena of the kind might be passing manifestations

of this music they could never exhaust its essence but would always

be merely its externalised copies of course as regards the intricate

relation of music and drama nothing can be explainedpg 166 while all may

be confused by the popular and thoroughly false antithesis of soul and

body but the unphilosophical crudeness of this antithesis seems to

have becomewho knows for what reasonsa readily accepted article of

faith with our stheticians while they have learned nothing concerning

an antithesis of phenomenon and thinginitself or perhaps for

reasons equally unknown have not cared to learn anything thereof
should it have been established by our analysis that the apollonian

element in tragedy has by means of its illusion gained a complete

victory over the dionysian primordial element of music and has made

music itself subservient to its end namely the highest and clearest

elucidation of the drama it would certainly be necessary to add the

very important restriction that at the most essential point this

apollonian illusion is dissolved and annihilated the drama which by

the aid of music spreads out before us with such inwardly illumined

distinctness in all its movements and figures that we imagine we

see the texture unfolding on the loom as the shuttle flies to and

froattains as a whole an effect which transcends all apollonian

artistic effects in the collective effect of tragedy the dionysian

gets the upper hand once more tragedy ends with a sound which could

never emanate from the realm of apollonian art and the apollonian

illusion is thereby found to be what it isthe assiduous veiling

during the performance of tragedy of the intrinsically dionysian

effect which however is so powerful that itpg 167 finally forces

the apollonian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to talk

with dionysian wisdom and even denies itself and its apollonian

conspicuousness thus then the intricate relation of the apollonian and

the dionysian in tragedy must really be symbolised by a fraternal union

of the two deities dionysus speaks the language of apollo apollo

however finally speaks the language of dionysus and so the highest

goal of tragedy and of art in general is attained
22
let the attentive friend picture to himself purely and simply

according to his experiences the effect of a true musical tragedy i

think i have so portrayed the phenomenon of this effect in both its

phases that he will now be able to interpret his own experiences for

he will recollect that with regard to the myth which passed before

him he felt himself exalted to a kind of omniscience as if his

visual faculty were no longer merely a surface faculty but capable

of penetrating into the interior and as if he now saw before him

with the aid of music the ebullitions of the will the conflict of

motives and the swelling stream of the passions almost sensibly

visible like a plenitude of actively moving lines and figures and

could thereby dip into the most tender secrets of unconscious emotions

while he thus becomes conscious of the highest exaltation of his

instincts for conspicuousness and transfiguration he nevertheless

feels with equalpg 168 definitiveness that this long series of apollonian

artistic effects still does not generate the blissful continuance in

willless contemplation which the plasticist and the epic poet that

is to say the strictly apollonian artists produce in him by their

artistic productions to wit the justification of the world of the

individuatio attained in this contemplationwhich is the object

and essence of apollonian art he beholds the transfigured world of

the stage and nevertheless denies it he sees before him the tragic

hero in epic clearness and beauty and nevertheless delights in his

annihilation he comprehends the incidents of the scene in all their

details and yet loves to flee into the incomprehensible he feels the

actions of the hero to be justified and is nevertheless still more

elated when these actions annihilate their originator he shudders at

the sufferings which will befall the hero and yet anticipates therein

a higher and much more overpowering joy he sees more extensively and

profoundly than ever and yet wishes to be blind whence must we derive

this curious internal dissension this collapse of the apollonian apex

if not from the dionysian spell which though apparently stimulating

the apollonian emotions to their highest pitch can nevertheless force

this superabundance of apollonian power into its service tragic

myth is to be understood only as a symbolisation of dionysian wisdom

by means of the expedients of apollonian art the mythus conducts the

world of phenomena to its boundaries where it denies itself and seeks

to flee back again into the bosom of the true and only reality where

it then likepg 169 isolde seems to strike up its metaphysical swansong

we thus realise to ourselves in the experiences of the truly sthetic

hearer the tragic artist himself when he proceeds like a luxuriously

fertile divinity of individuation to create his figures in which sense

his work can hardly be understood as an imitation of natureand

when on the other hand his vast dionysian impulse then absorbs the

entire world of phenomena in order to anticipate beyond it and

through its annihilation the highest artistic primal joy in the bosom

of the primordial unity of course our sthetes have nothing to say

about this return in fraternal union of the two artdeities to the

original home nor of either the apollonian or dionysian excitement

of the hearerpg 170 while they are indefatigable in characterising the

struggle of the hero with fate the triumph of the moral order of the

world or the disburdenment of the emotions through tragedy as the

properly tragic an indefatigableness which makes me think that they

are perhaps not sthetically excitable men at all but only to be

regarded as moral beings when hearing tragedy never since aristotle

has an explanation of the tragic effect been proposed by which an

sthetic activity of the hearer could be inferred from artistic

circumstances at one time fear and pity are supposed to be forced to

an alleviating discharge through the serious procedure at another time

we are expected to feel elevated and inspired at the triumph of good

and noble principles at the sacrifice of the hero in the interest of

a moral conception of things and however certainly i believe that for

countless men precisely this and only this is the effect of tragedy

it as obviously follows therefrom that all these together with their

interpreting sthetes have had no experience of tragedy as the highest

art the pathological discharge the catharsis of aristotle which

philologists are at a loss whether to include under medicinal or moral

phenomena recalls a remarkable anticipation of goethe without a

lively pathological interest he says i too have never yet succeeded

in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind and hence i have rather

avoided than sought it can it perhaps have been still another of the

merits of the ancients that the deepest pathos was with them merely

sthetic play whereas with us the truth of nature mustpg 171 cooperate in

order to produce such a work we can now answer in the affirmative

this latter profound question after our glorious experiences in which

we have found to our astonishment in the case of musical tragedy

itself that the deepest pathos can in reality be merely sthetic play

and therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time

the protophenomenon of the tragic can be portrayed with some degree

of success he who now will still persist in talking only of those

vicarious effects proceeding from ultrasthetic spheres and does not

feel himself raised above the pathologicallymoral process may be left

to despair of his sthetic nature for which we recommend to him by

way of innocent equivalent the interpretation of shakespeare after the

fashion of gervinus and the diligent search for poetic justice
thus with the rebirth of tragedy the sthetic hearer is also

born anew in whose place in the theatre a curious quid pro quo

was wont to sit with halfmoral and halflearned pretensionsthe

critic in his sphere hitherto everything has been artificial and

merely glossed over with a semblance of life the performing artist

was in fact at a loss what to do with such a critically comporting

hearer and hence he as well as the dramatist or operatic composer

who inspired him searched anxiously for the last remains of life

in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment such

critics however have hitherto constituted the public the student

the schoolboy yea even the most harmless womanly creaturepg 172 were

already unwittingly prepared by education and by journals for a similar

perception of works of art the nobler natures among the artists

counted upon exciting the moralreligious forces in such a public

and the appeal to a moral order of the world operated vicariously

when in reality some powerful artistic spell should have enraptured

the true hearer or again some imposing or at all events exciting

tendency of the contemporary political and social world was presented

by the dramatist with such vividness that the hearer could forget his

critical exhaustion and abandon himself to similar emotions as in

patriotic or warlike moments before the tribune of parliament or

at the condemnation of crime and vicean estrangement of the true

aims of art which could not but lead directly now and then to a cult

of tendency but here there took place what has always taken place

in the case of factitious arts an extraordinary rapid depravation

of these tendencies so that for instance the tendency to employ the

theatre as a means for the moral education of the people which in

schillers time was taken seriously is already reckoned among the

incredible antiquities of a surmounted culture while the critic got

the upper hand in the theatre and concerthall the journalist in the

school and the press in society art degenerated into a topic of

conversation of the most trivial kind and sthetic criticism was used

as the cement of a vain distracted selfish and moreover piteously

unoriginal sociality the significance of which is suggested by the

schopenhauerian parable of the porcupines so that therepg 173 has never

been so much gossip about art and so little esteem for it but is it

still possible to have intercourse with a man capable of conversing on

beethoven or shakespeare let each answer this question according to

his sentiments he will at any rate show by his answer his conception

of culture provided he tries at least to answer the question and

has not already grown mute with astonishment
on the other hand many a one more nobly and delicately endowed by

nature though he may have gradually become a critical barbarian

in the manner described could tell of the unexpected as well as

totally unintelligible effect which a successful performance of

lohengrin for example exerted on him except that perhaps every

warning and interpreting hand was lacking to guide him so that the

incomprehensibly heterogeneous and altogether incomparable sensation

which then affected him also remained isolated and became extinct like

a mysterious star after a brief brilliancy he then divined what the

sthetic hearer is

he who wishes to test himself rigorously as to how he is related to the

true sthetic hearer or whether he belongs rather to the community

of the socratocritical man has only to enquire sincerely concerning

the sentiment with which he accepts the wonder represented on the

stage whether he feels his historical sense which insists on strict

psychological causality insulted by itpg 174 whether with benevolent

concession he as it were admits the wonder as a phenomenon intelligible

to childhood but relinquished by him or whether he experiences

anything else thereby for he will thus be enabled to determine how

far he is on the whole capable of understanding myth that is to

say the concentrated picture of the world which as abbreviature of

phenomena cannot dispense with wonder it is probable however that

nearly every one upon close examination feels so disintegrated by

the criticohistorical spirit of our culture that he can only perhaps

make the former existence of myth credible to himself by learned

means through intermediary abstractions without myth however every

culture loses its healthy creative natural power it is only a horizon

encompassed with myths which rounds off to unity a social movement

it is only by myth that all the powers of the imagination and of the

apollonian dream are freed from their random rovings the mythical

figures have to be the invisibly omnipresent genii under the care of

which the young soul grows to maturity by the signs of which the man

gives a meaning to his life and struggles and the state itself knows

no more powerful unwritten law than the mythical foundation which

vouches for its connection with religion and its growth from mythical

ideas
let us now place alongside thereof the abstract man proceeding

independently of myth the abstract education the abstract usage

the abstract right the abstract state let us picture to ourselves

the lawless roving of the artistic imaginationpg 175 not bridled by any

native myth let us imagine a culture which has no fixed and sacred

primitive seat but is doomed to exhaust all its possibilities and

has to nourish itself wretchedly from the other culturessuch is the

present as the result of socratism which is bent on the destruction

of myth and now the mythless man remains eternally hungering among

all the bygones and digs and grubs for roots though he have to dig

for them even among the remotest antiquities the stupendous historical

exigency of the unsatisfied modern culture the gathering around one of

countless other cultures the consuming desire for knowledgewhat does

all this point to if not to the loss of myth the loss of the mythical

home the mythical source let us ask ourselves whether the feverish

and so uncanny stirring of this culture is aught but the eager seizing

and snatching at food of the hungererand who would care to contribute

anything more to a culture which cannot be appeased by all it devours

and in contact with which the most vigorous and wholesome nourishment

is wont to change into history and criticism
we should also have to regard our german character with despair and

sorrow if it had already become inextricably entangled in or even

identical with this culture in a similar manner as we can observe it

to our horror to be the case in civilised france and that which for

a long time was the great advantage of france and the cause of her

vast preponderance to wit this very identity of people and culture

might compel us at the sight thereofpg 176 to congratulate ourselves that

this culture of ours which is so questionable has hitherto had

nothing in common with the noble kernel of the character of our people

all our hopes on the contrary stretch out longingly towards the

perception that beneath this restlessly palpitating civilised life and

educational convulsion there is concealed a glorious intrinsically

healthy primeval power which to be sure stirs vigorously only at

intervals in stupendous moments and then dreams on again in view of

a future awakening it is from this abyss that the german reformation

came forth in the choralhymn of which the future melody of german

music first resounded so deep courageous and soulbreathing so

exuberantly good and tender did this chorale of luther soundas the

first dionysianluring call which breaks forth from dense thickets

at the approach of spring to it responded with emulative echo the

solemnly wanton procession of dionysian revellers to whom we are

indebted for german musicand to whom we shall be indebted for the

rebirth of german myth
i know that i must now lead the sympathising and attentive friend to

an elevated position of lonesome contemplation where he will have

but few companions and i call out encouragingly to him that we must

hold fast to our shining guides the greeks for the rectification

of our sthetic knowledge we previously borrowed from them the two

divine figures each of which sways a separate realm of art and

concerning whose mutual contact and exaltation we have acquiredpg 177 a

notion through greek tragedy through a remarkable disruption of both

these primitive artistic impulses the ruin of greek tragedy seemed

to be necessarily brought about with which process a degeneration

and a transmutation of the greek national character was strictly in

keeping summoning us to earnest reflection as to how closely and

necessarily art and the people myth and custom tragedy and the state

have coalesced in their bases the ruin of tragedy was at the same

time the ruin of myth until then the greeks had been involuntarily

compelled immediately to associate all experiences with their myths

indeed they had to comprehend them only through this association

whereby even the most immediate present necessarily appeared to them

sub specie terni and in a certain sense as timeless into this

current of the timeless however the state as well as art plunged

in order to find repose from the burden and eagerness of the moment

and a peoplefor the rest also a manis worth just as much only as

its ability to impress on its experiences the seal of eternity for

it is thus as it were desecularised and reveals its unconscious

inner conviction of the relativity of time and of the true that is

the metaphysical significance of life the contrary happens when a

people begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the

mythical bulwarks around it with which there is usually connected

a marked secularisation a breach with the unconscious metaphysics

of its earlier existence in all ethical consequences greek art and

especially greek tragedy delayedpg 178 above all the annihilation of myth

it was necessary to annihilate these also to be able to live detached

from the native soil unbridled in the wilderness of thought custom

and action even in such circumstances this metaphysical impulse still

endeavours to create for itself a form of apotheosis weakened no

doubt in the socratism of science urging to life but on its lower

stage this same impulse led only to a feverish search which gradually

merged into a pandemonium of myths and superstitions accumulated from

all quarters in the midst of which nevertheless the hellene sat with

a yearning heart till he contrived as grculus to mask his fever with

greek cheerfulness and greek levity or to narcotise himself completely

with some gloomy oriental superstition
we have approached this condition in the most striking manner since the

reawakening of the alexandroroman antiquity in the fifteenth century

after a long not easily describable interlude on the heights there

is the same exuberant love of knowledge the same insatiate happiness

of the discoverer the same stupendous secularisation and together

with these a homeless roving about an eager intrusion at foreign

tables a frivolous deification of the present or a dull senseless

estrangement all sub speci sculi of the present time which

same symptoms lead one to infer the same defect at the heart of

this culture the annihilation of myth it seems hardly possible to

transplant a foreign myth with permanent success without dreadfully

injuring the tree through this transplantation which is perhapspg 179

occasionally strong enough and sound enough to eliminate the foreign

element after a terrible struggle but must ordinarily consume itself

in a languishing and stunted condition or in sickly luxuriance our

opinion of the pure and vigorous kernel of the german being is such

that we venture to expect of it and only of it this elimination of

forcibly ingrafted foreign elements and we deem it possible that

the german spirit will reflect anew on itself perhaps many a one

will be of opinion that this spirit must begin its struggle with the

elimination of the romanic element for which it might recognise an

external preparation and encouragement in the victorious bravery and

bloody glory of the late war but must seek the inner constraint in the

emulative zeal to be for ever worthy of the sublime protagonists on

this path of luther as well as our great artists and poets but let

him never think he can fight such battles without his household gods

without his mythical home without a restoration of all german things

i and if the german should look timidly around for a guide to lead

him back to his longlost home the ways and paths of which he knows

no longerlet him but listen to the delightfully luring call of the

dionysian bird which hovers above him and would fain point out to him

the way thither

among the peculiar artistic effects of musical tragedy we had to

emphasise an apollonian illusion through which we are to be saved

frompg 180 immediate oneness with the dionysian music while our musical

excitement is able to discharge itself on an apollonian domain and

in an interposed visible middle world it thereby seemed to us that

precisely through this discharge the middle world of theatrical

procedure the drama generally became visible and intelligible from

within in a degree unattainable in the other forms of apollonian art

so that here where this art was as it were winged and borne aloft by

the spirit of music we had to recognise the highest exaltation of its

powers and consequently in the fraternal union of apollo and dionysus

the climax of the apollonian as well as of the dionysian artistic aims
of course the apollonian lightpicture did not precisely with this

inner illumination through music attain the peculiar effect of the

weaker grades of apollonian art what the epos and the animated stone

can doconstrain the contemplating eye to calm delight in the world

of the individuatiocould not be realised here notwithstanding

the greater animation and distinctness we contemplated the drama

and penetrated with piercing glance into its inner agitated world of

motivesand yet it seemed as if only a symbolic picture passed before

us the profoundest significance of which we almost believed we had

divined and which we desired to put aside like a curtain in order to

behold the original behind it the greatest distinctness of the picture

did not suffice us for it seemed to reveal as well as veil something

and while it seemed with its symbolicpg 181 revelation to invite the

rending of the veil for the disclosure of the mysterious background

this illumined allconspicuousness itself enthralled the eye and

prevented it from penetrating more deeply he who has not experienced

thisto have to view and at the same time to have a longing

beyond the viewingwill hardly be able to conceive how clearly and

definitely these two processes coexist in the contemplation of tragic

myth and are felt to be conjoined while the truly sthetic spectators

will confirm my assertion that among the peculiar effects of tragedy

this conjunction is the most noteworthy now let this phenomenon of the

sthetic spectator be transferred to an analogous process in the tragic

artist and the genesis of tragic myth will have been understood it

shares with the apollonian sphere of art the full delight in appearance

and contemplation and at the same time it denies this delight and

finds a still higher satisfaction in the annihilation of the visible

world of appearance the substance of tragic myth is first of all an

epic event involving the glorification of the fighting hero but whence

originates the essentially enigmatical trait that the suffering in

the fate of the hero the most painful victories the most agonising

contrasts of motives in short the exemplification of the wisdom of

silenus or sthetically expressed the ugly and discordant is always

represented anew in such countless forms with such predilection and

precisely in the most youthful and exuberant age of a people unless

there is really a higher delight experienced in all this
pg 182
for the fact that things actually take such a tragic course would

least of all explain the origin of a form of art provided that art

is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature but in truth a

metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature placed alongside

thereof for its conquest tragic myth in so far as it really belongs

to art also fully participates in this transfiguring metaphysical

purpose of art in general what does it transfigure however when it

presents the phenomenal world in the guise of the suffering hero least

of all the reality of this phenomenal world for it says to us look

at this look carefully it is your life it is the hourhand of your

clock of existence
and myth has displayed this life in order thereby to transfigure it

to us if not how shall we account for the sthetic pleasure with

which we make even these representations pass before us i am inquiring

concerning the sthetic pleasure and am well aware that many of

these representations may moreover occasionally create even a moral

delectation say under the form of pity or of a moral triumph but he

who would derive the effect of the tragic exclusively from these moral

sources as was usually the case far too long in sthetics let him not

think that he has done anything for art thereby for art must above all

insist on purity in her domain for the explanation of tragic myth the

very first requirement is that the pleasure which characterises it must

be sought in the purely sthetic sphere without encroaching on the

domain of pity fear or the morallysublimepg 183 how can the ugly and the

discordant the substance of tragic myth excite an sthetic pleasure
here it is necessary to raise ourselves with a daring bound into a

metaphysics of art i repeat therefore my former proposition that

it is only as an sthetic phenomenon that existence and the world

appear justified and in this sense it is precisely the function of

tragic myth to convince us that even the ugly and discordant is an

artistic game which the will in the eternal fulness of its joy plays

with itself but this not easily comprehensible protophenomenon of

dionysian art becomes in a direct way singularly intelligible and

is immediately apprehended in the wonderful significance of musical

dissonance just as in general it is music alone placed in contrast

to the world which can give us an idea as to what is meant by the

justification of the world as an sthetic phenomenon the joy that the

tragic myth excites has the same origin as the joyful sensation of

dissonance in music the dionysian with its primitive joy experienced

in pain itself is the common source of music and tragic myth
is it not possible that by calling to our aid the musical relation of

dissonance the difficult problem of tragic effect may have meanwhile

been materially facilitated for we now understand what it means to

wish to view tragedy and at the same time to have a longing beyond the

viewing a frame of mind which as regards the artistically employed

dissonance we should simply have to characterise by saying that we

desire to hear and at the same time have a longing beyond the hearing

that strivingpg 184 for the infinite the pinionflapping of longing

accompanying the highest delight in the clearlyperceived reality

remind one that in both states we have to recognise a dionysian

phenomenon which again and again reveals to us anew the playful

upbuilding and demolishing of the world of individuals as the efflux

of a primitive delight in like manner as when heraclitus the obscure

compares the worldbuilding power to a playing child which places

stones here and there and builds sandhills only to overthrow them again
hence in order to form a true estimate of the dionysian capacity of

a people it would seem that we must think not only of their music

but just as much of their tragic myth the second witness of this

capacity considering this most intimate relationship between music

and myth we may now in like manner suppose that a degeneration and

depravation of the one involves a deterioration of the other if it be

true at all that the weakening of the myth is generally expressive of

a debilitation of the dionysian capacity concerning both however

a glance at the development of the german genius should not leave

us in any doubt in the opera just as in the abstract character of

our mythless existence in an art sunk to pastime just as in a life

guided by concepts the inartistic as well as lifeconsuming nature

of socratic optimism had revealed itself to us yet there have been

indications to console us that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss

the german spirit still rests and dreams undestroyed in glorious

health profundity and dionysian strength like a knight sunk inpg 185

slumber from which abyss the dionysian song rises to us to let us

know that this german knight even still dreams his primitive dionysian

myth in blissfully earnest visions let no one believe that the german

spirit has for ever lost its mythical home when it still understands so

obviously the voices of the birds which tell of that home some day it

will find itself awake in all the morning freshness of a deep sleep

then it will slay the dragons destroy the malignant dwarfs and waken

brnnhildeand wotans spear itself will be unable to obstruct its

course
my friends ye who believe in dionysian music ye know also what

tragedy means to us there we have tragic myth born anew from

musicand in this latest birth ye can hope for everything and forget

what is most afflicting what is most afflicting to all of us however

isthe prolonged degradation in which the german genius has lived

estranged from house and home in the service of malignant dwarfs ye

understand my allusionas ye will also in conclusion understand my

hopes
25
music and tragic myth are equally the expression of the dionysian

capacity of a people and are inseparable from each other both

originate in an ultra apollonian sphere of art both transfigure a

region in the delightful accords of which all dissonance just like

the terrible picture of the world dies charmingly away both play

with the sting of displeasure trusting to their most potent magicpg 186

both justify thereby the existence even of the worst world here

the dionysian as compared with the apollonian exhibits itself as

the eternal and original artistic force which in general calls into

existence the entire world of phenomena in the midst of which a new

transfiguring appearance becomes necessary in order to keep alive the

animated world of individuation if we could conceive an incarnation

of dissonanceand what is man but thatthen to be able to live

this dissonance would require a glorious illusion which would spread

a veil of beauty over its peculiar nature this is the true function

of apollo as deity of art in whose name we comprise all the countless

manifestations of the fair realm of illusion which each moment render

life in general worth living and make one impatient for the experience

of the next moment
at the same time just as much of this basis of all existencethe

dionysian substratum of the worldis allowed to enter into the

consciousness of human beings as can be surmounted again by the

apollonian transfiguring power so that these two artimpulses are

constrained to develop their powers in strictly mutual proportion

according to the law of eternal justice when the dionysian powers rise

with such vehemence as we experience at present there can be no doubt

that veiled in a cloud apollo has already descended to us whose

grandest beautifying influences a coming generation will perhaps behold
that this effect is necessary however each one would most surely

perceive by intuition if once he found himself carried backeven in

a dreamintopg 187 an oldhellenic existence in walking under high ionic

colonnades looking upwards to a horizon defined by clear and noble

lines with reflections of his transfigured form by his side in shining

marble and around him solemnly marching or quietly moving men with

harmoniously sounding voices and rhythmical pantomime would he not in

the presence of this perpetual influx of beauty have to raise his hand

to apollo and exclaim blessed race of hellenes how great dionysus

must be among you when the delian god deems such charms necessary

to cure you of your dithyrambic madnessto one in this frame of

mind however an aged athenian looking up to him with the sublime

eye of schylus might answer say also this thou curious stranger

what sufferings this people must have undergone in order to be able

to become thus beautiful but now follow me to a tragic play and

sacrifice with me in the temple of both the deities

pg 189
appendix
late in the year 1888 not long before he was overcome by his sudden

attack of insanity nietzsche wrote down a few notes concerning

his early work the birth of tragedy these were printed in his

sisters biography das leben friedrich nietzsches vol ii pt

i pp 102 ff and are here translated as likely to be of interest

to readers of this remarkable work they also appear in the ecce

homotranslators note
to be just to the birth of tragedy1872 one will have to forget

some few things it has wrought effects it even fascinated through

that wherein it was amissthrough its application to wagnerism

just as if this wagnerism were symptomatic of a rise and going up

and just on that account was the book an event in wagners life from

thence and only from thence were great hopes linked to the name of

wagner even today people remind me sometimes right in the midst of

a talk on parsifal that i and none other have it on my conscience

that such a high opinion of the cultural value of this movement came

to the top more than once have i found the book referred to as the

rebirth of tragedy out of the spirit of music one only had an ear

for a new formula of wagners art aim taskand failed to hearpg 190

withal what was at bottom valuable therein hellenism and pessimism

had been a more unequivocal title namely as a first lesson on the

way in which the greeks got the better of pessimismon the means

whereby they overcame it tragedy simply proves that the greeks were

no pessimists schopenhauer was mistaken here as he was mistaken

in all other things considered with some neutrality the birth of

tragedy appears very unseasonable one would not even dream that

it was begun amid the thunders of the battle of wrth i thought

these problems through and through before the walls of metz in cold

september nights in the midst of the work of nursing the sick one

might even believe the book to be fifty years older it is politically

indifferentungerman one will say todayit smells shockingly

hegelian in but a few formul does it scent of schopenhauers

funereal perfume an ideathe antithesis of dionysian versus

apolloniantranslated into metaphysics history itself as the

evolution of this idea the antithesis dissolved into oneness

in tragedy through this optics things that had never yet looked

into one anothers face confronted of a sudden and illumined and

comprehended through one another for instance opera and revolution

the two decisive innovations of the book are on the one hand the

comprehension of the dionysian phenomenon among the greeks it gives

the first psychology thereof it sees therein the one root of all

grecian art on the other the comprehension of socratism socrates

diagnosed for the first time as the toolpg 191 of grecian dissolution as

a typical decadent rationality against instinct rationality

at any price as a dangerous as a lifeundermining force throughout

the whole book a deep hostile silence on christianity it is neither

apollonian nor dionysian it negatives all sthetic values the

only values recognised by the birth of tragedy it is in the widest

sense nihilistic whereas in the dionysian symbol the utmost limit

of affirmation is reached once or twice the christian priests are

alluded to as a malignant kind of dwarfs as subterraneans
2
this beginning is singular beyond measure i had for my own inmost

experience discovered the only symbol and counterpart of historyi

had just thereby been the first to grasp the wonderful phenomenon

of the dionysian and again through my diagnosing socrates as a

decadent i had given a wholly unequivocal proof of how little risk

the trustworthiness of my psychological grasp would run of being

weakened by some moralistic idiosyncrasyto view morality itself as a

symptom of decadence is an innovation a novelty of the first rank in

the history of knowledge how far i had leaped in either case beyond

the smug shallowpategossip of optimism contra pessimism i was

the first to see the intrinsic antithesis here the degenerating

instinct which with subterranean vindictiveness turns against life

christianity the philosophy of schopenhauer in a certain sense

already the philosophy of plato all idealisticpg 192 systems as typical

forms and there a formula of highest affirmation born of fullness

and overfullness a yeasaying without reserve to sufferings self

to guilts self to all that is questionable and strange in existence

itself this final cheerfullest exuberantly madandmerriest yea to

life is not only the highest insight it is also the deepest it

is that which is most rigorously confirmed and upheld by truth and

science naught that is is to be deducted naught is dispensable the

phases of existence rejected by the christians and other nihilists are

even of an infinitely higher order in the hierarchy of values than

that which the instinct of decadence sanctions yea durst sanction

to comprehend this courage is needed and as a condition thereof a

surplus of strength for precisely in degree as courage dares to

thrust forward precisely according to the measure of strength does

one approach truth perception the yeasaying to reality is as much

a necessity to the strong as to the weak under the inspiration of

weakness cowardly shrinking and flight from realitythe ideal

 they are not free to perceive the decadents have need of the

lieit is one of their conditions of selfpreservation whoso not

only comprehends the word dionysian but also grasps his self in

this word requires no refutation of plato or of christianity or of

schopenhauerhe smells the putrefaction
3
to what extent i had just thereby found the concept tragic the

definitive perception of the pg 193

psychology of tragedy i have but lately stated in the twilight of the

idols page 139 1st edit the affirmation of life even in its

most unfamiliar and severe problems the will to life enjoying its

own inexhaustibility in the sacrifice of its highest typesthat

is what i called dionysian that is what i divined as the bridge to a

psychology of the tragic poet not in order to get rid of terror and

pity not to purify from a dangerous passion by its vehement discharge

it was thus that aristotle misunderstood it but beyond terror

and pity to realise in fact the eternal delight of becoming that

delight which even involves in itself the joy of annihilating1

in this sense i have the right to understand myself to be the first

tragic philosopherthat is the utmost antithesis and antipode to a

pessimistic philosopher prior to myself there is no such translation

of the dionysian into the philosophic pathos there lacks the tragic

wisdomi have sought in vain for an indication thereof even among

the great greeks of philosophy the thinkers of the two centuries

before socrates a doubt still possessed me as touching heraclitus

in whose proximity i in general begin to feel warmer and better than

anywhere else the affirmation of transiency and annihilation to

wit the decisive factor in a dionysian philosophy the yeasaying

to antithesis and war to becoming with radical rejection even of

the concept beingthat i must directly acknowledge as of all

thinking hitherto the nearest to my own the doctrine ofpg 194 eternal

recurrence that is of the unconditioned and infinitely repeated

cycle of all thingsthis doctrine of zarathustras might after all

have been already taught by heraclitus at any rate the portico2

which inherited wellnigh all its fundamental conceptions from

heraclitus shows traces thereof

in this book speaks a prodigious hope in fine i see no reason

whatever for taking back my hope of a dionysian future for music let

us cast a glance a century ahead let us suppose my assault upon two

millenniums of antinature and manvilification succeeds that new

party of life which will take in hand the greatest of all tasks the

upbreeding of mankind to something higheradd thereto the relentless

annihilation of all things degenerating and parasitic will again make

possible on earth that toomuch of life from which there also must

needs grow again the dionysian state i promise a tragic age the

highest art in the yeasaying to life tragedy will be born anew when

mankind have behind them the consciousness of the hardest but most

necessary wars without suffering therefrom a psychologist might

still add that what i heard in my younger years in wagnerian music had

in general naught to do with wagner that when i described wagnerian

music i described what i had heard that i had instinctively to

translate and transfigure all into the new spirit which i bore within

myself

translators note
while the translator flatters himself that this version of nietzsches

early workhaving been submitted to unsparingly scrutinising eyesis

not altogether unworthy of the original he begs to state that he

holds twentiethcentury english to be a rather unsatisfactory vehicle

for philosophical thought accordingly in conjunction with his

friend dr ernest lacy he has prepared a second more unconventional

translationin brief a translation which will enable one whose

knowledge of english extends to say the period of elizabeth to

appreciate nietzsche in more forcible language because the language of

a stronger age it is proposed to provide this second translation with

an appendix containing many references to the translated writings of

wagner and schopenhauer to the works of pater browning burckhardt

rohde and others and a summmary and index

the antichrist

 introduction
save for his raucous rhapsodical autobiography ecce homo the

antichrist is the last thing that nietzsche ever wrote and so it may

be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their

final form notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to

have constituted the first volume of his longprojected magnum opus

the will to power his full plan for this work as originally drawn

up was as follows


vol
i
the antichrist an attempt at a criticism of christianity


vol
ii
the free spirit a criticism of philosophy as a nihilistic

  movement


vol
iii
the immoralist a criticism of morality the most fatal form of

  ignorance


vol
iv
dionysus the philosophy of eternal recurrence


the first sketches for the will to power were made in 1884 soon after

 the publication of the first three parts of thus spake zarathustra

and thereafter for four years nietzsche piled up notes they were

written at all the places he visited on his endless travels in search of

healthat nice at venice at silsmaria in the engadine for long his

favourite resort at cannobio at zrich at genoa at chur at

leipzig several times his work was interrupted by other books first by

beyond good and evil then by the genealogy of morals written in

twenty days then by his wagner pamphlets almost as often he changed

his plan once he decided to expand the will to power to ten volumes

with an attempt at a new interpretation of the world as a general

subtitle again he adopted the subtitle of an interpretation of all

that happens finally he hit upon an attempt at a transvaluation of

all values and went back to four volumes though with a number of

changes in their arrangement in september 1888 he began actual work

upon the first volume and before the end of the month it was completed

the summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity since

the middle of june he had written two other small books the case of

wagner and the twilight of the idols and before the end of the  year

he was destined to write ecce homo some time during december his

health began to fail rapidly and soon after the new year he was

helpless thereafter he wrote no more
the wagner diatribe and the twilight of the idols were published

immediately but the antichrist did not get into type until 1895 i

suspect that the delay was due to the influence of the philosophers

sister elisabeth frsternietzsche an intelligent and ardent but by no

means uniformly judicious propagandist of his ideas during his dark

days of neglect and misunderstanding when even family and friends kept

aloof frau frsternietzsche went with him farther than any other but

there were bounds beyond which she also hesitated to go and those

bounds were marked by crosses one notes in her biography of hima

useful but not always accurate workan evident desire to purge him of

the accusation of mocking at sacred things he had she says great

admiration for the elevating effect of christianity  upon the weak

and ailing and a real liking for sincere pious christians and a

tender love for the founder of christianity all his wrath she

continues was reserved for st paul and his like who  perverted the

beatitudes which christ intended for the lowly only into a universal

religion which made war upon aristocratic values here obviously one

is addressed by an interpreter who cannot forget that she is the

daughter of a lutheran pastor and the granddaughter of two others a

touch of conscience gets into her reading of the antichrist she even

hints that the text may have been garbled after the authors collapse

by some more sinister heretic there is not the slightest reason to

believe that any such garbling ever took place nor is there any

evidence that their common heritage of piety rested upon the brother as

heavily as it rested upon the sister on the contrary it must be

manifest that nietzsche in this book intended to attack christianity

headlong and with all arms that for all his rapid writing he put the

utmost care into it and that he wanted it to be printed exactly as it

stands the ideas in it were anything but new to him when he set them

down he had been developing them since the days of his beginning you

will find some of them clearly recognizable in the first book he ever

wrote the birth of tragedy you will find the most important of all

of themthe conception of christianity as  ressentimentset forth at

length in the first part of the genealogy of morals published under

his own supervision in 1887 and the rest are scattered through the

whole vast mass of his notes sometimes as mere questionings but often

worked out very carefully moreover let it not be forgotten that it was

wagners yielding to christian sentimentality in parsifal that

transformed nietzsche from the first among his literary advocates into

the most bitter of his opponents he could forgive every other sort of

mountebankery but not that in me he once said the christianity of

my forbears reaches its logical conclusion in me the stern intellectual

conscience that christianity fosters and makes paramount turns against

christianity in me christianity  devours itself
in truth the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of

the whole of nietzsches system as the keystone is to the arch all the

curves of his speculation lead up to it what he flung himself against

from beginning to end of his days of writing was always in the last

analysis christianity in some form or otherchristianity as a system

of practical ethics christianity as a political code christianity as

meta physics christianity as a gauge of the truth it would be

difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long list that

did not more or less directly and clearly relate itself to this master

enterprise of them all it was as if his apostasy from the

faith of his fathers filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert

and particularly of the convert to heresy had blinded him to every

other element in the gigantic selfdelusion of civilized man the will

to power was his answer to christianitys affectation of humility and

selfsacrifice eternal recurrence was his mocking criticism of

christian optimism and millennialism the superman was his candidate for

the place of the christian ideal of the good man prudently abased

before the throne of god the things he chiefly argued for were

antichristian thingsthe abandonment of the purely moral view of life

the rehabilitation of instinct the dethronement of weakness and

timidity as ideals the renunciation of the whole hocuspocus of

dogmatic religion the extermination of false aristocracies of the

priest of the politician of the plutocrat the revival of the

healthy lordly innocence that was greek if he was anything in a

word nietzsche was a greek born two thousand  years too late his

dreams were thoroughly hellenic his whole manner of thinking was

hellenic his peculiar errors were hellenic no less but his hellenism

i need not add was anything but the pale neoplatonism that has run

like a thread through the thinking of the western world since the days

of the christian fathers from plato to be sure he got what all of us

must get but his real forefather was heraclitus it is in heraclitus

that one finds the germ of his primary view of the universea view to

wit that sees it not as moral phenomenon but as mere aesthetic

representation the god that nietzsche imagined in the end was not far

from the god that such an artist as joseph conrad imaginesa supreme

craftsman ever experimenting ever coming closer to an ideal balancing

of lines and forces and yet always failing to work out the final

harmony
the late war awakening all the primitive racial fury of the western

nations and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos

and sanctions naturally focused attention upon nietzsche as upon the

most daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians the germans

with their characteristic tendency to ex plain their every act in terms

as realistic and unpleasant as possible appear to have mauled him in a

belated and unexpected embrace to the horror i daresay of the kaiser

and perhaps to the even greater horror of nietzsches own ghost the

folks of anglosaxondom with their equally characteristic tendency to

explain all their enterprises romantically simultaneously set him up as

the antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be the result was a great

deal of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of him from the pulpits

of the allied countries and particularly from those of england and the

united states a horde of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced him in

extravagant terms as the author of all the horrors of the time and in

the newspapers until the kaiser was elected sole bugaboo he shared the

honors of that office with von hindenburg the crown prince capt

boyed von bernstorff and von tirpitz most of this denunciation of

course was frankly idioticthe nave pishposh of suburban methodists

notorietyseeking college professors almost illiterate editorial

writers and other such numskulls in much of it including not a few

official hymns of hate nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the

teacher of such  spokesmen of the extremest sort of german nationalism

as von bernhardi and von treitschkewhich was just as intelligent as

making george bernard shaw the mentor of lloydgeorge in other solemn

pronunciamentoes he was credited with being philosophically responsible

for various imaginary crimes of the enemythe wholesale slaughter or

mutilation of prisoners of war the deliberate burning down of red cross

hospitals the utilization of the corpses of the slain for soapmaking

i amused myself in those gaudy days by collecting newspaper clippings

to this general effect and later on i shall probably publish a digest

of them as a contribution to the study of war hysteria the thing went

to unbelievable lengths on the strength of the fact that i had

published a book on nietzsche in 1906 six years after his death i was

called upon by agents of the department of justice elaborately

outfitted with badges to meet the charge that i was an intimate

associate and agent of the german monster nietzsky i quote the

official procs verbal an indignant but often misspelled document

alas poor nietzsche after all his laborious efforts to prove that he

was not a german but a poleeven  after his heroic readiness via

antiantisemitism to meet the deduction that if a pole then probably

also a jew
but under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a

sound instinct and that was the instinct which recognized nietzsche as

the most eloquent pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the

philosophy to which the allies against germany stood committed and on

the strength of which at all events in theory the united states had

engaged itself in the war he was not in point of fact involved with

the visible enemy save in remote and transient ways the german

officially remained the most ardent of christians during the war and

became a democrat at its close but he was plainly a foe of democracy in

all its forms political religious and epistemological and what is

worse his opposition was set forth in terms that were not only

extraordinarily penetrating and devastating but also uncommonly

offensive it was thus quite natural that he should have aroused a

degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries

that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly

and that felt it most shaky one may add under their feet  i daresay

that nietzsche had he been alive would have got a lot of satisfaction

out of the execration thus heaped upon him not only because being a

vain fellow he enjoyed execration as a tribute to his general

singularity and hence to his superiority but also and more importantly

because being no mean psychologist he would have recognized the

disconcerting doubts underlying it if nietzsches criticism of

democracy were as ignorant and empty say as the average evangelical

clergymans criticism of darwins hypothesis of natural selection then

the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the

darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks and if his attack

upon christianity were mere sound and fury signifying nothing then

there would be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk but these

onslaughts in point of fact have behind them a tremendous learning and

a great deal of point and plausibilitythere are in brief bullets in

the gun teeth in the tigerand so it is no wonder that they excite

the ire of men who hold as a primary article of belief that their

acceptance would destroy civilization darken the sun and bring jahveh

to sobs upon his throne
 but in all this justifiable fear of course there remains a false

assumption and that is the assumption that nietzsche proposed to

destroy christianity altogether and so rob the plain people of the

world of their virtue their spiritual consolations and their hope of

heaven nothing could be more untrue the fact is that nietzsche had no

interest whatever in the delusions of the plain peoplethat is

intrinsically it seemed to him of small moment what they believed so

long as it was safely imbecile what he stood against was not their

beliefs but the elevation of those beliefs by any sort of democratic

process to the dignity of a state philosophywhat he feared most was

the pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual

disease from below his plain aim in the antichrist was to combat that

menace by completing the work begun on the one hand by darwin and the

other evolutionist philosophers and on the other hand by german

historians and philologians the net effect of this earlier attack in

the eighties had been the collapse of christian theology as a serious

concern of educated men the mob it must be obvious was very little

shaken even to this day it has not put  off its belief in the essential

christian doctrines but the intelligentsia by 1885 had been pretty

well convinced no man of sound information at the time nietzsche

planned the antichrist actually believed that the world was created

in seven days or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a

penalty for the sins of man or that noah saved the boa constrictor the

prairie dog and the pediculus capitis by taking a pair of each into

the ark or that lots wife was turned into a pillar of salt or that a

fragment of the true cross could cure hydrophobia such notions still

almost universally prevalent in christendom a century before were now

confined to the great body of ignorant and credulous menthat is to

ninetyfive or ninetysix percent of the race for a man of the

superior minority to subscribe to one of them publicly was already

sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical

attention belief in them had become a mark of inferiority like the

allied belief in madstones magic and apparitions
but though the theology of christianity had thus sunk to the lowly

estate of a mere delusion of the rabble propagated on that level by the

ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites the ethics  of christianity

continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance and perhaps even more

acceptance than ever before it seemed to be generally felt in fact

that they simply must be saved from the wreckthat the world would

vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting

them in this fear a great many judicious men joined and so there arose

what was in essence an absolutely new christian culta cult to wit

purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by

generations of theologians and harking back to what was conceived to be

the pure ethical doctrine of jesus this cult still flourishes

protestantism tends to become identical with it it invades catholicism

as modernism it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence

is manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question even nietzsche

himself yielded to it in weak moments as you will discover on examining

his somewhat laborious effort to make paul the villain of christian

theology and jesus no more than an innocent bystander but this

sentimental yielding never went far enough to distract his attention for

long from his main idea which was this that christian ethics were

quite as dubious at bot tom as christian theologythat they were

founded just as surely as such childish fables as the story of jonah

and the whale upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities the special

desires and appetites of inferior menthat they warred upon the best

interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most

extravagant of objective superstitions in brief what he saw in

christian ethics under all the poetry and all the fine show of altruism

and all the theoretical benefits therein was a democratic effort to

curb the egoism of the stronga conspiracy of the chandala against

the free functioning of their superiors nay against the free progress

of mankind this theory is the thing he exposes in the antichrist

bringing to the business his amazingly chromatic and exigent eloquence

at its finest flower this is the conspiracy he sets forth in all the

panoply of his characteristic italics dashes sforzando interjections

and exclamation points
well an idea is an idea the present one may be right and it may be

wrong one thing is quite certain that no progress will be made against

it by denouncing it as merely immoral if it is ever laid at all it

must be laid evidenti ally logically the notion to the contrary is

thoroughly democratic the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants it is

always in a democratic society that heresy and felony tend to be most

constantly confused one hears without surprise of a bismarck

philosophizing placidly at least in his old age upon the delusion of

socialism and of a frederick the great playing the hose of his cynicism

upon the absolutism that was almost identical with his own person but

men in the mass never brook the destructive discussion of their

fundamental beliefs and that impatience is naturally most evident in

those societies in which men in the mass are most influential democracy

and free speech are not facets of one gem democracy and free speech are

eternal enemies but in any battle between an institution and an idea

the idea in the long run has the better of it here i do not venture

into the absurdity of arguing that as the world wags on the truth

always survives i believe nothing of the sort as a matter of fact it

seems to me that an idea that happens to be trueor more exactly as

near to truth as any human idea can be and yet remain generally

intelligibleit seems to me that such an idea carries a special and

often fatal handi cap the majority of men prefer delusion to truth it

soothes it is easy to grasp above all it fits more snugly than the

truth into a universe of false appearancesof complex and irrational

phenomena defectively grasped but though an idea that is true is thus

not likely to prevail an idea that is attacked enjoys a great

advantage the evidence behind it is now supported by sympathy the

sporting instinct sentimentalityand sentimentality is as powerful as

an army with banners one never hears of a martyr in history whose

notions are seriously disputed today the forgotten ideas are those of

the men who put them forward soberly and quietly hoping fatuously that

they would conquer by the force of their truth these are the ideas that

we now struggle to rediscover had nietzsche lived to be burned at the

stake by outraged mississippi methodists it would have been a glorious

day for his doctrines as it is they are helped on their way every time

they are denounced as immoral and against god the war brought down upon

them the maledictions of vast herds of rightthinking men and now the

antichrist after fifteen years of neglect is being reprinted
 one imagines the author a sardonic wraith snickering somewhat sadly

over the fact his shade wherever it suffers is favoured in these days

by many such consolations some of them of much greater horsepower

think of the facts and arguments even the underlying theories and

attitudes that have been borrowed from him consciously and

unconsciously by the foes of bolshevism during these last thrilling

years the face of democracy suddenly seen hideously close has scared

the guardians of the reigning plutocracy half to death and they have

gone to the devil himself for aid southern senators almost illiterate

men have mixed his acids with well water and spouted them like

affrighted geysers not knowing what they did nor are they the first to

borrow from him years ago i called attention to the debt incurred with

characteristic forgetfulness of obligation by the late theodore

roosevelt in the strenuous life and elsewhere roosevelt a typical

apologist for the existing order adeptly dragging a herring across the

trail whenever it was menaced yet managed to delude the native boobery

at least until toward the end into accepting him as a fiery exponent of

pure democ racy perhaps he even fooled himself charlatans usually do

so soon or late a study of nietzsche reveals the sources of much that

was honest in him and exposes the hollowness of much that was sham

nietzsche an infinitely harder and more courageous intellect was

incapable of any such confusion of ideas he seldom allowed

sentimentality to turn him from the glaring fact what is called

bolshevism today he saw clearly a generation ago and described for what

it was and isdemocracy in another aspect the old

ressentiment of the lower orders in free function

once more socialism puritanism philistinism christianityhe saw

them all as allotropic forms of democracy as variations upon the

endless struggle of quantity against quality of the weak and timorous

against the strong and enterprising of the botched against the fit the

world needed a staggering exaggeration to make it see even half of the

truth it trembles today as it trembled during the french revolution

perhaps it would tremble less if it could combat the monster with a

clearer conscience and less burden of compromising theoryif it could

launch its forces frankly at the fundamental doctrine and  not merely

employ them to police the transient orgy
nietzsche in the long run may help it toward that greater honesty his

notions propagated by cuttings from cuttings from cuttings may

conceivably prepare the way for a sounder more healthful theory of

society and of the state and so free human progress from the

stupidities which now hamper it and men of true vision from the

despairs which now sicken them i say it is conceivable but i doubt

that it is probable the soul and the belly of mankind are too evenly

balanced it is not likely that the belly will ever put away its hunger

or forget its power here perhaps there is an example of the eternal

recurrence that nietzsche was fond of mulling over in his blacker moods

we are in the midst of one of the perennial risings of the lower orders

it got under way long before any of the current bolshevist demons was

born it was given its long secure start by the intolerable tyranny of

the plutocracythe end product of the eighteenth century revolt against

the old aristocracy it found resistance suddenly slackened by civil war

within the plutocracy itselfone gang of traders falling upon another

gang to the tune of  vast hymnsinging and yells to god perhaps it has

already passed its apogee the plutocracy chastened shows signs of a

new solidarity the wheel continues to swing round but this combat

between proletariat and plutocracy is after all itself a civil war

two inferiorities struggle for the privilege of polluting the world

what actual difference does it make to a civilized man when there is a

steel strike whether the workmen win or the millowners win the

conflict can interest him only as spectacle as the conflict between

bonaparte and the old order in europe interested goethe and beethoven

the victory whichever way it goes will simply bring chaos nearer and

so set the stage for a genuine revolution later on with let us hope a

new feudalism or something better coming out of it and a new thirteenth

century at dawn this seems to be the slow costly way of the worst of

habitable worlds
in the present case my money is laid upon the plutocracy it will win

because it will be able in the long run to enlist the finer

intelligences the mob and its maudlin causes attract only

sentimentalists and scoundrels chiefly the latter politics under a

democracy reduces  itself to a mere struggle for office by flatterers

of the proletariat even when a superior man prevails at that disgusting

game he must prevail at the cost of his selfrespect not many superior

men make the attempt the average great captain of the rabble when he

is not simply a weeper over irremediable wrongs is a hypocrite so far

gone that he is unconscious of his own hypocrisya slimy fellow

offensive to the nose the plutocracy can recruit measurably more

respectable janissaries if only because it can make selfinterest less

obviously costly to amour propre its defect and its weakness lie in

the fact that it is still too young to have acquired dignity but lately

sprung from the mob it now preys upon it yet shows some of the habits

of mind of that mob it is blatant stupid ignorant lacking in all

delicate instinct and governmental finesse above all it remains

somewhat heavily moral one seldom finds it undertaking one of its

characteristic imbecilities without offering a sonorous moral reason it

spends almost as much to support the y m c a vicecrusading

prohibition and other such puerilities as it spends upon congressmen

strikebreakers gunmen kept patriots and newspapers in eng land the

case is even worse it is almost impossible to find a wealthy industrial

over there who is not also an eminent nonconformist layman and even

among financiers there are praying brothers on the continent the day

is saved by the fact that the plutocracy tends to become more and more

jewish here the intellectual cynicism of the jew almost counterbalances

his social unpleasantness if he is destined to lead the plutocracy of

the world out of little bethel he will fail of course to turn it into

an aristocracyi e a caste of gentlemen but he will at least

make it clever and hence worthy of consideration the case against the

jews is long and damning it would justify ten thousand times as many

pogroms as now go on in the world but whenever you find a

davidsbndlerschaft making practise against the philistines there you

will find a jew laying on maybe it was this fact that caused nietzsche

to speak up for the children of israel quite as often as he spoke

against them he was not blind to their faults but when he set them

beside christians he could not deny their general superiority perhaps

in america and england as on the continent the increasing jewishness

of the plutocracy while  cutting it off from all chance of ever

developing into an aristocracy will yet lift it to such a dignity that

it will at least deserve a certain grudging respect
but even so it will remain in a sort of halfworld midway between the

gutter and the stars above it will still stand the small group of men

that constitutes the permanent aristocracy of the racethe men of

imagination and high purpose the makers of genuine progress the brave

and ardent spirits above all petty fears and discontents and above all

petty hopes and ideals no less there were heroes before agamemnon

there will be bachs after johann sebastian and beneath the judaized

plutocracy the sublimated bourgeoisie there the immemorial

proletariat i venture to guess will roar on endlessly tortured by its

vain hatreds and envies stampeded and made to tremble by its ancient

superstitions prodded and made miserable by its sordid and degrading

hopes it seems to me very likely that in this proletariat

christianity will continue to survive it is nonsense true enough but

it is sweet nietzsche denouncing its dangers as a poison almost falls

into the error of denying it its undoubtedly sugary smack of  all the

religions ever devised by the great practical jokers of the race this

is the one that offers most for the least money so to speak to the

inferior man it starts out by denying his inferiority in plain terms

all men are equal in the sight of god it ends by erecting that

inferiority into a sort of actual superiority it is a merit to be

stupid and miserable and sorely put uponof such are the celestial

elect not all the eloquence of a million nietzsches nor all the

painful marshalling of evidence of a million darwins and harnacks will

ever empty that great consolation of its allure the most they can ever

accomplish is to make the superior orders of men acutely conscious of

the exact nature of it and so give them armament against the contagion

this is going on this is being done i think that the antichrist has

a useful place in that enterprise it is strident it is often

extravagant it is to many sensitive men in the worst of possible

taste but at bottom it is enormously apt and effectiveand on the

surface it is undoubtedly a good show one somehow enjoys with the

malice that is native to man the spectacle of anathemas batted back it

is refreshing to see the pitchfork employed against gentlemen who have 

doomed such innumerable caravans to hell in nietzsche they found after

many long years a foeman worthy of themnot a mere fancy swordsman

like voltaire or a mob orator like tom paine or a pedant like the

heretics of exegesis but a gladiator armed with steel and armoured with

steel and showing all the ferocious gusto of a mediaeval bishop it is

a pity that holy church has no process for the elevation of demons like

its process for the canonization of saints there must be a long roll of

black miracles to the discredit of the accursed friedrichsinners

purged of conscience and made happy in their sinning clerics shaken in

their theology by visions of a new and better holy city the strong made

to exult the weak robbed of their old sad romance it would be a

pleasure to see the advocatus diaboli turn from the table of the

prosecution to the table of the defence and move in solemn form for the

damnation of the naumburg hobgoblin
of all nietzsches books the antichrist comes nearest to

conventionality in form it presents a connected argument with very few

interludes and has a beginning a middle and an end most of his works

are in the form of col lections of apothegms and sometimes the subject

changes on every second page this fact constitutes one of the counts in

the orthodox indictment of him it is cited as proof that his capacity

for consecutive thought was limited and that he was thus deficient

mentally and perhaps a downright moron the argument it must be

obvious is fundamentally nonsensical what deceives the professors is

the traditional prolixity of philosophers because the average

philosophical writer when he essays to expose his ideas makes such

inordinate drafts upon the parts of speech that the dictionary is almost

emptied these defective observers jump to the conclusion that his

intrinsic notions are of corresponding weight this is not unseldom

quite untrue what makes philosophy so garrulous is not the profundity

of philosophers but their lack of art they are like physicians who

sought to cure a slight hyperacidity by giving the patient a carload of

burned oystershells to eat there is too the endless pollparrotting

that goes on each new philosopher must prove his learning by

laboriously rehearsing the ideas of all previous philosophers

nietzsche avoided both faults he always assumed that his readers  knew

the books and that it was thus unnecessary to rewrite them and having

an idea that seemed to him to be novel and original he stated it in as

few words as possible and then shut down sometimes he got it into a

hundred words sometimes it took a thousand now and then as in the

present case he developed a series of related ideas into a connected

book but he never wrote a word too many he never pumped up an idea to

make it appear bigger than it actually was the pedagogues alas are

not accustomed to that sort of writing in serious fields they resent

it and sometimes they even try to improve it there exists in fact a

huge and solemn tome on nietzsche by a learned man of america in which

all of his brilliancy is painfully translated into the windy phrases of

the seminaries the tome is satisfactorily ponderous but the meat of

the cocoanut is left out there is actually no discussion of the

nietzschean view of christianity always nietzsche daunts the

pedants he employed too few words for themand he had too many ideas

the present translation of the antichrist is published by agreement

with dr oscar levy  editor of the english edition of nietzsche there

are two earlier translations one by thomas common and the other by

anthony m ludovici that of mr common follows the text very closely

and thus occasionally shows some essentially german turns of phrase

that of mr ludovici is more fluent but rather less exact i do not

offer my own version on the plea that either of these is useless on the

contrary i cheerfully acknowledge that they have much merit and that

they helped me at almost every line i began this new englishing of the

book not in any hope of supplanting them and surely not with any

notion of meeting a great public need but simply as a private amusement

in troubled days but as i got on with it i began to see ways of putting

some flavour of nietzsches peculiar style into the english and so

amusement turned into a more or less serious labour the result of

course is far from satisfactory but it at least represents a very

diligent attempt nietzsche always under the influence of french

models wrote a german that differs materially from any other german

that i know it is more nervous more varied more rapid in tempo it

runs to more effective climaxes it is never  stodgy his marks begin to

show upon the writing of the younger germans of today they are getting

away from the old thunderous manner with its long sentences and its

tedious grammatical complexities in the course of time i daresay they

will develop a german almost as clear as french and almost as colourful

and resilient as english
i owe thanks to dr levy for his imprimatur to mr theodor hemberger

for criticism and to messrs common and ludovici for showing me the way

around many a difficulty

this book belongs to the most rare of men perhaps not one of them is

yet alive it is possible that they may be among those who understand my

zarathustra how could i confound myself with those who are now

sprouting earsfirst the day after tomorrow must come for me some men

are born posthumously
the conditions under which any one understands me and necessarily

understands mei know them only too well even to endure my

seriousness my passion he must carry intellectual integrity to the

verge of hardness he must be accustomed to living on mountain topsand

to looking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as

beneath him he must have become indifferent he must never ask of the

truth whether it brings profit to him or a fatality to him he must

have an inclination born of strength for questions that no one has the

courage for the courage for the forbidden predestination for the

labyrinth  the experience of seven solitudes new ears for new music

new eyes for what is most distant a new conscience for truths that have

hitherto remained unheard and the will to economize in the grand

mannerto hold together his strength his enthusiasm reverence for

self love of self absolute freedom of self

 the antichrist
1
let us look each other in the face we are hyperboreanswe know well

enough how remote our place is neither by land nor by water will you

find the road to the hyperboreans even pindar1 in his day knew

that much about us beyond the north beyond the ice beyond

deathour life our happiness we have discovered that

happiness we know the way we got our knowledge of it from thousands of

years in the labyrinth who else has found itthe man of todayi

dont know either the way out or the way in i am whatever doesnt know

either the way out or the way inso sighs the man of today this

is the sort of modernity that made us illwe sickened on lazy peace

cowardly compro mise the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and

nay this tolerance and largeur of the heart that forgives

everything because it understands everything is a sirocco to us

rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such

southwinds we were brave enough we spared neither ourselves nor

others but we were a long time finding out where to direct our

courage we grew dismal they called us fatalists our fateit was

the fulness the tension the storing up of powers we thirsted for

the lightnings and great deeds we kept as far as possible from the

happiness of the weakling from resignation there was thunder in

our air nature as we embodied it became overcastfor we had not yet

found the way the formula of our happiness a yea a nay a straight

line a goal
1 cf the tenth pythian ode see also the fourth book of

herodotus the hyperboreans were a mythical people beyond the rhipaean

mountains in the far north they enjoyed unbroken happiness and

perpetual youth
2
what is goodwhatever augments the feeling of power the will to

power power itself in man
what is evilwhatever springs from weakness
 what is happinessthe feeling that power increasesthat resistance

is overcome
not contentment but more power not peace at any price but war

not virtue but efficiency virtue in the renaissance sense virtu

virtue free of moral acid
the weak and the botched shall perish first principle of our charity

and one should help them to it
what is more harmful than any vicepractical sympathy for the botched

and the weakchristianity
3
the problem that i set here is not what shall replace mankind in the

order of living creatures man is an end but what type of man must

be bred must be willed as being the most valuable the most worthy

of life the most secure guarantee of the future
this more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past but

always as a happy accident as an exception never as deliberately

willed very often it has been precisely the most feared hitherto it

has been almost the terror of terrorsand out of that terror the 

contrary type has been willed cultivated and attained the domestic

animal the herd animal the sick brutemanthe christian
4
mankind surely does not represent an evolution toward a better or

stronger or higher level as progress is now understood this progress

is merely a modern idea which is to say a false idea the european of

today in his essential worth falls far below the european of the

renaissance the process of evolution does not necessarily mean

elevation enhancement strengthening
true enough it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various

parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures and in

these cases a higher type certainly manifests itself something which

compared to mankind in the mass appears as a sort of superman such

happy strokes of high success have always been possible and will remain

possible perhaps for all time to come even whole races tribes and

nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents
 5
we should not deck out and embellish christianity it has waged a war to

the death against this higher type of man it has put all the deepest

instincts of this type under its ban it has developed its concept of

evil of the evil one himself out of these instinctsthe strong man as

the typical reprobate the outcast among men christianity has taken

the part of all the weak the low the botched it has made an ideal out

of antagonism to all the selfpreservative instincts of sound life it

has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are

intellectually most vigorous by representing the highest intellectual

values as sinful as misleading as full of temptation the most

lamentable example the corruption of pascal who believed that his

intellect had been destroyed by original sin whereas it was actually

destroyed by christianity
6
it is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me i have drawn

back the curtain from the rottenness of man this word in my mouth 

is at least free from one suspicion that it involves a moral accusation

against humanity it is usedand i wish to emphasize the fact

againwithout any moral significance and this is so far true that the

rottenness i speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters

where there has been most aspiration hitherto toward virtue and

godliness as you probably surmise i understand rottenness in the

sense of dcadence my argument is that all the values on which

mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are dcadencevalues
i call an animal a species an individual corrupt when it loses its

instincts when it chooses when it prefers what is injurious to it

a history of the higher feelings the ideals of humanityand it is

possible that ill have to write itwould almost explain why man is so

degenerate life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth for

survival for the accumulation of forces for power whenever the will

to power fails there is disaster my contention is that all the highest

values of humanity have been emptied of this willthat the values of

dcadence of nihilism now prevail under the holiest names
 7
christianity is called the religion of pitypity stands in

opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the

feeling of aliveness it is a depressant a man loses power when he

pities through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is

multiplied a thousandfold suffering is made contagious by pity under

certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and

living energya loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the

cause the case of the death of the nazarene this is the first view

of it there is however a still more important one if one measures

the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up its

character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light pity

thwarts the whole law of evolution which is the law of natural

selection it preserves whatever is ripe for destruction it fights on

the side of those disinherited and condemned by life by maintaining

life in so many of the botched of all kinds it gives life itself a

gloomy and dubious aspect mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue

in every superior moral  system it appears as a weakness going

still further it has been called the virtue the source and

foundation of all other virtuesbut let us always bear in mind that

this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic and

upon whose shield the denial of life was inscribed schopenhauer was

right in this that by means of pity life is denied and made worthy of

denialpity is the technic of nihilism let me repeat this depressing

and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work

for the preservation and enhancement of life in the rle of protector

of the miserable it is a prime agent in the promotion of

dcadencepity persuades to extinction of course one doesnt say

extinction one says the other world or god or the true

life or nirvana salvation blessedness this innocent rhetoric

from the realm of religiousethical balderdash appears a good deal

less innocent when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals

beneath sublime words the tendency to destroy life schopenhauer was

hostile to life that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue

aristotle as every one knows saw in pity a sickly and dangerous  state

of mind the remedy for which was an occasional purgative he regarded

tragedy as that purgative the instinct of life should prompt us to seek

some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous

accumulation of pity as that appearing in schopenhauers case and also

alack in that of our whole literary dcadence from st petersburg to

paris from tolstoi to wagner that it may burst and be discharged

nothing is more unhealthy amid all our unhealthy modernism than

christian pity to be the doctors here to be unmerciful here to

wield the knife hereall this is our business all this is our

sort of humanity by this sign we are philosophers we hyperboreans
8
it is necessary to say just whom we regard as our antagonists

theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veinsthis

is our whole philosophy one must have faced that menace at close

hand better still one must have had experience of it directly and

almost succumbed to it to realize that it is not to be taken lightly

the alleged freethinking of our  naturalists and physiologists seems

to me to be a jokethey have no passion about such things they have

not suffered this poisoning goes a great deal further than most

people think i find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who

regard themselves as idealistsamong all who by virtue of a higher

point of departure claim a right to rise above reality and to look

upon it with suspicion the idealist like the ecclesiastic carries

all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand and not only in his hand

he launches them with benevolent contempt against understanding the

senses honor good living science he sees such things as

beneath him as pernicious and seductive forces on which the soul

soars as a pure thinginitselfas if humility chastity poverty in a

word holiness had not already done much more damage to life than all

imaginable horrors and vices the pure soul is a pure lie so long

as the priest that professional denier calumniator and poisoner of

life is accepted as a higher variety of man there can be no answer

to the question what is truth truth has already been stood on its

head when the obvious attorney of  mere emptiness is mistaken for its

representative
9
upon this theological instinct i make war i find the tracks of it

everywhere whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and

dishonourable in all things the pathetic thing that grows out of this

condition is called faith in other words closing ones eyes upon

ones self once for all to avoid suffering the sight of incurable

falsehood people erect a concept of morality of virtue of holiness

upon this false view of all things they ground good conscience upon

faulty vision they argue that no other sort of vision has value any

more once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of god

salvation and eternity i unearth this theological instinct in all

directions it is the most widespread and the most subterranean form

of falsehood to be found on earth whatever a theologian regards as true

must be false there you have almost a criterion of truth his

profound instinct of selfpreservation stands against truth ever coming

into honour in any way or even getting stated wherever the in fluence

of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values and the

concepts true and false are forced to change places whatever is

most damaging to life is there called true and whatever exalts it

intensifies it approves it justifies it and makes it triumphant is

there called false when theologians working through the

consciences of princes or of peoples stretch out their hands for

power there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue the will

to make an end the nihilistic will exerts that power
10
among germans i am immediately understood when i say that theological

blood is the ruin of philosophy the protestant pastor is the

grandfather of german philosophy protestantism itself is its peccatum

originale definition of protestantism hemiplegic paralysis of

christianityand of reason one need only utter the words

tbingen school to get an understanding of what german philosophy is

at bottoma very artful form of theology the suabians are the best

liars in germany they lie innocently why all  the rejoicing over

the appearance of kant that went through the learned world of germany

threefourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and

teacherswhy the german conviction still echoing that with kant came a

change for the better the theological instinct of german scholars

made them see clearly just what had become possible again a

backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open the concept of the true

world the concept of morality as the essence of the world the two

most vicious errors that ever existed were once more thanks to a

subtle and wily scepticism if not actually demonstrable then at

least no longer refutable reason the prerogative of reason

does not go so far out of reality there had been made appearance

an absolutely false world that of being had been turned into

reality the success of kant is merely a theological success he was

like luther and leibnitz but one more impediment to german integrity

already far from steady
11
a word now against kant as a moralist a virtue must be our invention

it must spring out  of our personal need and defence in every other

case it is a source of danger that which does not belong to our life

menaces it a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the

concept of virtue as kant would have it is pernicious virtue

duty good for its own sake goodness grounded upon impersonality or

a notion of universal validitythese are all chimeras and in them one

finds only an expression of the decay the last collapse of life the

chinese spirit of knigsberg quite the contrary is demanded by the most

profound laws of selfpreservation and of growth to wit that every man

find his own virtue his own categorical imperative a nation goes

to pieces when it confounds its duty with the general concept of duty

nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every

impersonal duty every sacrifice before the moloch of abstractionto

think that no one has thought of kants categorical imperative as

dangerous to life the theological instinct alone took it under

protectionan action prompted by the lifeinstinct proves that it is a

right action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it and yet that

nihilist with his bowels  of christian dogmatism regarded pleasure as

an objection what destroys a man more quickly than to work think

and feel without inner necessity without any deep personal desire

without pleasureas a mere automaton of duty that is the recipe for

dcadence and no less for idiocy kant became an idiotand such

a man was the contemporary of goethe this calamitous spinner of cobwebs

passed for the german philosopherstill passes today i forbid

myself to say what i think of the germans didnt kant see in the

french revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic

form to the organic didnt he ask himself if there was a single event

that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in

man so that on the basis of it the tendency of mankind toward the

good could be explained once and for all time kants answer that

is revolution instinct at fault in everything and anything instinct

as a revolt against nature german dcadence as a philosophythat is

kant 
12
i put aside a few sceptics the types of decency in the history of

philosophy the rest havent the slightest conception of intellectual

integrity they behave like women all these great enthusiasts and

prodigiesthey regard beautiful feelings as arguments the heaving

breast as the bellows of divine inspiration conviction as the

criterion of truth in the end with german innocence kant tried to

give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption this dearth of

intellectual conscience by calling it practical reason he

deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it

was desirable not to trouble with reasonthat is when morality when

the sublime command thou shalt was heard when one recalls the fact

that among all peoples the philosopher is no more than a development

from the old type of priest this inheritance from the priest this

fraud upon self ceases to be remarkable when a man feels that he has

a divine mission say to lift up to save or to liberate mankindwhen a

man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the

mouthpiece of super natural imperativeswhen such a mission inflames

him it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely

reasonable standards of judgment he feels that he is himself

sanctified by this mission that he is himself a type of a higher

order what has a priest to do with philosophy he stands far above

itand hitherto the priest has ruledhe has determined the meaning

of true and not true
13
let us not underestimate this fact that we

ourselves we free spirits are already a transvaluation of all

values a visualized declaration of war and victory against all the

old concepts of true and not true the most valuable intuitions are

the last to be attained the most valuable of all are those which

determine methods all the methods all the principles of the

scientific spirit of today were the targets for thousands of years of

the most profound contempt if a man inclined to them he was excluded

from the society of decent peoplehe passed as an enemy of god as

a scoffer at the truth as one possessed as  a man of science he

belonged to the chandala2 we have had the whole pathetic stupidity

of mankind against ustheir every notion of what the truth ought to

be of what the service of the truth ought to betheir every thou

shalt was launched against us our objectives our methods our

quiet cautious distrustful mannerall appeared to them as absolutely

discreditable and contemptiblelooking back one may almost ask ones

self with reason if it was not actually an aesthetic sense that kept

men blind so long what they demanded of the truth was picturesque

effectiveness and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses it

was our modesty that stood out longest against their taste how

well they guessed that these turkeycocks of god
2 the lowest of the hindu castes
14
we have unlearned something we have become more modest in every way we

no longer derive man from the spirit from the godhead we have

dropped him back among the beasts we regard him as the strongest of the

beasts because he is the craftiest one of the re sults thereof is his

intellectuality on the other hand we guard ourselves against a conceit

which would assert itself even here that man is the great second

thought in the process of organic evolution he is in truth anything

but the crown of creation beside him stand many other animals all at

similar stages of development and even when we say that we say a bit

too much for man relatively speaking is the most botched of all the

animals and the sickliest and he has wandered the most dangerously from

his instinctsthough for all that to be sure he remains the most

interestingas regards the lower animals it was descartes who first

had the really admirable daring to describe them as machina the whole

of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine

moreover it is illogical to set man apart as descartes did what we

know of man today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have

regarded him too as a machine formerly we accorded to man as his

inheritance from some higher order of beings what was called free

will now we have taken even this will from him for the term no longer

describes anything that we can understand the old word  will now

connotes only a sort of result an individual reaction that follows

inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious

stimulithe will no longer acts or moves formerly it was

thought that mans consciousness his spirit offered evidence of his

high origin his divinity that he might be perfected he was advised

tortoiselike to draw his senses in to have no traffic with earthly

things to shuffle off his mortal coilthen only the important part of

him the pure spirit would remain here again we have thought out the

thing better to us consciousness or the spirit appears as a symptom

of a relative imperfection of the organism as an experiment a groping

a misunderstanding as an affliction which uses up nervous force

unnecessarilywe deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it

is done consciously the pure spirit is a piece of pure stupidity

take away the nervous system and the senses the socalled mortal

shell and the rest is miscalculationthat is all
 15
under christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of

contact with actuality it offers purely imaginary causes god

soul ego spirit free willor even unfree and purely

imaginary effects sin salvation grace punishment

forgiveness of sins intercourse between imaginary beings god

spirits souls an imaginary natural history anthropocentric a

total denial of the concept of natural causes an imaginary

psychology misunderstandings of self misinterpretations of agreeable

or disagreeable general feelingsfor example of the states of the

nervus sympathicus with the help of the signlanguage of

religioethical balderdash repentance pangs of conscience

temptation by the devil the presence of god an imaginary

teleology the kingdom of god the last judgment eternal

lifethis purely fictitious world greatly to its disadvantage is

to be differentiated from the world of dreams the latter at least

reflects reality whereas the former falsifies it cheapens it and

denies it once the concept of nature had  been opposed to the concept

of god the word natural necessarily took on the meaning of

abominablethe whole of that fictitious world has its sources in

hatred of the natural the real and is no more than evidence of a

profound uneasiness in the presence of reality this explains

everything who alone has any reason for living his way out of reality

the man who suffers under it but to suffer from reality one must be a

botched reality the preponderance of pains over pleasures is the

cause of this fictitious morality and religion but such a preponderance

also supplies the formula for dcadence
16
a criticism of the christian concept of god leads inevitably to the

same conclusiona nation that still believes in itself holds fast to

its own god in him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to

survive to its virtuesit projects its joy in itself its feeling of

power into a being to whom one may offer thanks he who is rich will

give of his riches a proud people need a god to whom they can make

sacrifices religion within these  limits is a form of gratitude

a man is grateful for his own existence to that end he needs a

godsuch a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries he

must be able to play either friend or foehe is wondered at for the

good he does as well as for the evil he does but the castration

against all nature of such a god making him a god of goodness alone

would be contrary to human inclination mankind has just as much need

for an evil god as for a good god it doesnt have to thank mere

tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence what would be

the value of a god who knew nothing of anger revenge envy scorn

cunning violence who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous

ardeurs of victory and of destruction no one would understand such a

god why should any one want himtrue enough when a nation is on the

downward path when it feels its belief in its own future its hope of

freedom slipping from it when it begins to see submission as a first

necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of

selfpreservation then it must overhaul its god he then becomes a

hypocrite timorous and demure he counsels peace of  soul

hatenomore leniency love of friend and foe he moralizes

endlessly he creeps into every private virtue he becomes the god of

every man he becomes a private citizen a cosmopolitan formerly he

represented a people the strength of a people everything aggressive

and thirsty for power in the soul of a people now he is simply the

good god the truth is that there is no other alternative for gods

either they are the will to powerin which case they are national

godsor incapacity for powerin which case they have to be good
17
wherever the will to power begins to decline in whatever form there is

always an accompanying decline physiologically a dcadence the

divinity of this dcadence shorn of its masculine virtues and

passions is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically

degraded of the weak of course they do not call themselves the

weak they call themselves the good no hint is needed to indicate

the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an

evil god first became  possible the same instinct which prompts the

inferior to reduce their own god to goodnessinitself also prompts

them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors

they make revenge on their masters by making a devil of the latters

godthe good god and the devil like himboth are abortions of

dcadencehow can we be so tolerant of the navet of christian

theologians as to join in their doctrine that the evolution of the

concept of god from the god of israel the god of a people to the

christian god the essence of all goodness is to be described as

progressbut even renan does this as if renan had a right to be

nave the contrary actually stares one in the face when everything

necessary to ascending life when all that is strong courageous

masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god when

he has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary a

sheetanchor for the drowning when he becomes the poor mans god the

sinners god the invalids god par excellence and the attribute of

saviour or redeemer remains as the one essential attribute of

divinityjust what is the significance of such a metamorphosis

what  does such a reduction of the godhead implyto be

sure the kingdom of god has thus grown larger formerly he had only

his own people his chosen people but since then he has gone

wandering like his people themselves into foreign parts he has given

up settling down quietly anywhere finally he has come to feel at home

everywhere and is the great cosmopolitanuntil now he has the great

majority on his side and half the earth but this god of the great

majority this democrat among gods has not become a proud heathen god

on the contrary he remains a jew he remains a god in a corner a god

of all the dark nooks and crevices of all the noisesome quarters of the

world his earthly kingdom now as always is a kingdom of the

underworld a souterrain kingdom a ghetto kingdom and he himself

is so pale so weak so dcadent even the palest of the pale are

able to master himmessieurs the metaphysicians those albinos of the

intellect they spun their webs around him for so long that finally he

was hypnotized and began to spin himself and became another

metaphysician thereafter he resumed once more his old busi ness of

spinning the world out of his inmost being sub specie spinozae

thereafter he became ever thinner and palerbecame the ideal became

pure spirit became the absolute became the thinginitself

the collapse of a god he became a thinginitself
18
the christian concept of a godthe god as the patron of the sick the

god as a spinner of cobwebs the god as a spiritis one of the most

corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world it probably

touches lowwater mark in the ebbing evolution of the godtype god

degenerated into the contradiction of life instead of being its

transfiguration and eternal yea in him war is declared on life on

nature on the will to live god becomes the formula for every slander

upon the here and now and for every lie about the beyond in him

nothingness is deified and the will to nothingness is made holy
19
the fact that the strong races of northern europe did not repudiate this

christian god does  little credit to their gift for religionand not

much more to their taste they ought to have been able to make an end of

such a moribund and wornout product of the dcadence a curse lies

upon them because they were not equal to it they made illness

decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instinctsand since then

they have not managed to create any more gods two thousand years have

come and goneand not a single new god instead there still exists

and as if by some intrinsic rightas if he were the ultimatum and

maximum of the power to create gods of the creator spiritus in

mankindthis pitiful god of christian monotonotheism this hybrid

image of decay conjured up out of emptiness contradiction and vain

imagining in which all the instincts of dcadence all the cowardices

and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction
20
in my condemnation of christianity i surely hope i do no injustice to a

related religion with an even larger number of believers i allude to

buddhism both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religionsthey

are both dcadence  religionsbut they are separated from each other

in a very remarkable way for the fact that he is able to compare them

at all the critic of christianity is indebted to the scholars of

indiabuddhism is a hundred times as realistic as christianityit is

part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively

and coolly it is the product of long centuries of philosophical speculation the concept god was already disposed

of before it appeared buddhism is the only genuinely positive

religion to be encountered in history and this applies even to its

epistemology which is a strict phenomenalism it does not speak of a

struggle with sin but yielding to reality of the struggle with

suffering sharply differentiating itself from christianity it puts

the selfdeception that lies in moral concepts behind it it is in my

phrase beyond good and evilthe two physiological facts upon which

it grounds itself and upon which it bestows its chief attention are

first an excessive sensitiveness to sensation which manifests itself

as a refined susceptibility to pain and secondly an extraordinary

spirituality a too protracted concern with concepts and logical

procedures under  the influence of which the instinct of personality

has yielded to a notion of the impersonal both of these states

will be familiar to a few of my readers the objectivists by

experience as they are to me these physiological states produced a

depression and buddha tried to combat it by hygienic measures

against it he prescribed a life in the open a life of travel

moderation in eating and a careful selection of foods caution in the

use of intoxicants the same caution in arousing any of the passions

that foster a bilious habit and heat the blood finally no worry

either on ones own account or on account of others he encourages ideas

that make for either quiet contentment or good cheerhe finds means to

combat ideas of other sorts he understands good the state of goodness

as something which promotes health prayer is not included and

neither is asceticism there is no categorical imperative nor any

disciplines even within the walls of a monastery it is always

possible to leave these things would have been simply means of

increasing the excessive sensitiveness above mentioned for the same

reason he does not advocate any conflict with unbelievers his teaching 

is antagonistic to nothing so much as to revenge aversion

ressentiment enmity never brings an end to enmity the moving

refrain of all buddhism and in all this he was right for it is

precisely these passions which in view of his main regiminal purpose

are unhealthful the mental fatigue that he observes already plainly

displayed in too much objectivity that is in the individuals loss

of interest in himself in loss of balance and of egoism he combats

by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual interests back to the

ego in buddhas teaching egoism is a duty the one thing needful

the question how can you be delivered from suffering regulates and

determines the whole spiritual diet perhaps one will here recall

that athenian who also declared war upon pure scientificality to wit

socrates who also elevated egoism to the estate of a morality
21
the things necessary to buddhism are a very mild climate customs of

great gentleness and liberality and no militarism moreover it must

get its start among the higher and better edu cated classes

cheerfulness quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata

and they are attained buddhism is not a religion in which perfection

is merely an object of aspiration perfection is actually normal
under christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed

come to the fore it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their

salvation in it here the prevailing pastime the favourite remedy for

boredom is the discussion of sin selfcriticism the inquisition of

conscience here the emotion produced by power called god is

pumped up by prayer here the highest good is regarded as

unattainable as a gift as grace here too open dealing is lacking

concealment and the darkened room are christian here body is despised

and hygiene is denounced as sensual the church even ranges itself

against cleanliness the first christian order after the banishment of

the moors closed the public baths of which there were 270 in cordova

alone christian too is a certain cruelty toward ones self and

toward others hatred of unbelievers the will to persecute sombre and

disquieting ideas are in the foreground the most esteemed states of 

mind bearing the most respectable names are epileptoid the diet is so

regulated as to engender morbid symptoms and overstimulate the nerves

christian again is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth to

the aristocraticalong with a sort of secret rivalry with them one

resigns ones body to them one wants only ones soul and

christian is all hatred of the intellect of pride of courage of

freedom of intellectual libertinage christian is all hatred of the

senses of joy in the senses of joy in general
22
when christianity departed from its native soil that of the lowest

orders the underworld of the ancient world and began seeking power

among barbarian peoples it no longer had to deal with exhausted men

but with men still inwardly savage and capable of selftorturein

brief strong men but bungled men here unlike in the case of the

buddhists the cause of discontent with self suffering through self is

not merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain but on

the contrary an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others a

tendency  to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas

christianity had to embrace barbaric concepts and valuations in order

to obtain mastery over barbarians of such sort for example are the

sacrifices of the firstborn the drinking of blood as a sacrament the

disdain of the intellect and of culture torture in all its forms

whether bodily or not the whole pomp of the cult buddhism is a

religion for peoples in a further state of development for races that

have become kind gentle and overspiritualized europe is not yet

ripe for it it is a summons that takes them back to peace and

cheerfulness to a careful rationing of the spirit to a certain

hardening of the body christianity aims at mastering beasts of prey

its modus operandi is to make them illto make feeble is the

christian recipe for taming for civilizing buddhism is a religion

for the closing overwearied stages of civilization christianity

appears before civilization has so much as begununder certain

circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof
 23
buddhism i repeat is a hundred times more austere more honest more

objective it no longer has to justify its pains its susceptibility

to suffering by interpreting these things in terms of sinit simply

says as it simply thinks i suffer to the barbarian however

suffering in itself is scarcely understandable what he needs first of

all is an explanation as to why he suffers his mere instinct

prompts him to deny his suffering altogether or to endure it in

silence here the word devil was a blessing man had to have an

omnipotent and terrible enemythere was no need to be ashamed of

suffering at the hands of such an enemy
at the bottom of christianity there are several subtleties that belong

to the orient in the first place it knows that it is of very little

consequence whether a thing be true or not so long as it is believed

to be true truth and faith here we have two wholly distinct worlds

of ideas almost two diametrically opposite worldsthe road to the

one and the road to the other lie miles apart to understand that fact

thoroughlythis is almost enough in the orient to make one  a sage

the brahmins knew it plato knew it every student of the esoteric knows

it when for example a man gets any pleasure out of the notion that

he has been saved from sin it is not necessary for him to be actually

sinful but merely to feel sinful but when faith is thus exalted

above everything else it necessarily follows that reason knowledge and

patient inquiry have to be discredited the road to the truth becomes a

forbidden roadhope in its stronger forms is a great deal more

powerful stimulans to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be

man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict

with actuality can dash itso high indeed that no fulfilment can

satisfy it a hope reaching out beyond this world precisely because

of this power that hope has of making the suffering hold out the greeks

regarded it as the evil of evils as the most malign of evils it

remained behind at the source of all evil3in order that love may

be possible god must become a person in order that the lower instincts

may take a hand in the matter god must be young to satisfy the ardor of

the woman a beautiful  saint must appear on the scene and to satisfy

that of the men there must be a virgin these things are necessary if

christianity is to assume lordship over a soil on which some

aphrodisiacal or adonis cult has already established a notion as to what

a cult ought to be to insist upon chastity greatly strengthens the

vehemence and subjectivity of the religious instinctit makes the cult

warmer more enthusiastic more soulfullove is the state in which man

sees things most decidedly as they are not the force of illusion

reaches its highest here and so does the capacity for sweetening for

transfiguring when a man is in love he endures more than at any other

time he submits to anything the problem was to devise a religion which

would allow one to love by this means the worst that life has to offer

is overcomeit is scarcely even noticedso much for the three

christian virtues faith hope and charity i call them the three

christian ingenuitiesbuddhism is in too late a stage of

development too full of positivism to be shrewd in any such way
3 that is in pandoras box
 24
here i barely touch upon the problem of the origin of christianity

the first thing necessary to its solution is this that christianity

is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprungit

is not a reaction against jewish instincts it is their inevitable

product it is simply one more step in the aweinspiring logic of the

jews in the words of the saviour salvation is of the jews4the

second thing to remember is this that the psychological type of the

galilean is still to be recognized but it was only in its most

degenerate form which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign

features that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used

as a type of the saviour of mankind
4 john iv 22
the jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world for

when they were confronted with the question to be or not to be they

chose with perfectly unearthly deliberation to be at any price this

price involved a radical falsification of all nature of all

naturalness of all reality of the whole inner world  as well as of

the outer they put themselves against all those conditions under

which hitherto a people had been able to live or had even been

permitted to live out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood

in direct opposition to natural conditionsone by one they distorted

religion civilization morality history and psychology until each

became a contradiction of its natural significance we meet with the

same phenomenon later on in an incalculably exaggerated form but only

as a copy the christian church put beside the people of god shows a

complete lack of any claim to originality precisely for this reason the

jews are the most fateful people in the history of the world their

influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that

today the christian can cherish antisemitism without realizing that it

is no more than the final consequence of judaism
in my genealogy of morals i give the first psychological explanation

of the concepts underlying those two antithetical things a noble

morality and a ressentiment morality the second of which is a mere

product of the denial of the former the judaeochristian moral  system

belongs to the second division and in every detail in order to be able

to say nay to everything representing an ascending evolution of

lifethat is to wellbeing to power to beauty to selfapprovalthe

instincts of ressentiment here become downright genius had to invent

an other world in which the acceptance of life appeared as the most

evil and abominable thing imaginable psychologically the jews are a

people gifted with the very strongest vitality so much so that when

they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose

voluntarily and with a profound talent for selfpreservation the side

of all those instincts which make for dcadencenot as if mastered

by them but as if detecting in them a power by which the world could

be defied the jews are the very opposite of dcadents they have

simply been forced into appearing in that guise and with a degree of

skill approaching the non plus ultra of histrionic genius they have

managed to put themselves at the head of all dcadent movements for

example the christianity of paul and so make of them something

stronger than any party frankly saying yes to  life to the sort of

men who reach out for power under judaism and christianitythat is to

say to the priestly classdcadence is no more than a means to an

end men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind sick and

in confusing the values of good and bad true and false in a

manner that is not only dangerous to life but also slanders it
25
the history of israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt

to denaturize all natural values i point to five facts which bear

this out originally and above all in the time of the monarchy israel

maintained the right attitude of things which is to say the natural

attitude its jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power

its joy in itself its hopes for itself to him the jews looked for

victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them

whatever was necessary to their existenceabove all rain jahveh is

the god of israel and consequently the god of justice this is the

logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in

the use of it in the religious ceremonial of the  jews both aspects of

this selfapproval stand revealed the nation is grateful for the high

destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion it is grateful for the

benign procession of the seasons and for the good fortune attending its

herds and its cropsthis view of things remained an ideal for a long

while even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows

anarchy within and the assyrian without but the people still retained

as a projection of their highest yearnings that vision of a king who

was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judgea vision best

visualized in the typical prophet i e critic and satirist of the

moment isaiahbut every hope remained unfulfilled the old god no

longer could do what he used to do he ought to have been abandoned

but what actually happened simply this the conception of him was

changedthe conception of him was denaturized this was the price

that had to be paid for keeping himjahveh the god of justicehe

is in accord with israel no more he no longer vizualizes the national

egoism he is now a god only conditionally the public notion of this

god now becomes merely a  weapon in the hands of clerical agitators who

interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment

for obedience or disobedience to him for sin that most fraudulent of

all imaginable interpretations whereby a moral order of the world is

set up and the fundamental concepts cause and effect are stood on

their heads once natural causation has been swept out of the world by

doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of unnatural causation

becomes necessary and all other varieties of the denial of nature

follow it a god who demandsin place of a god who helps who gives

counsel who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of

courage and selfreliance morality is no longer a reflection of

the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the

people it is no longer the primary lifeinstinct instead it has become

abstract and in opposition to lifea fundamental perversion of the

fancy an evil eye on all things what is jewish what is

christian morality chance robbed of its innocence unhappiness polluted

with the idea of sin wellbeing represented  as a danger as a

temptation a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of

conscience
26
the concept of god falsified the concept of morality falsifiedbut

even here jewish priestcraft did not stop the whole history of israel

ceased to be of any value out with itthese priests accomplished that

miracle of falsification of which a great part of the bible is the

documentary evidence with a degree of contempt unparalleled and in the

face of all tradition and all historical reality they translated the

past of their people into religious terms which is to say they

converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation whereby all

offences against jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was

rewarded we would regard this act of historical falsification as

something far more shameful if familiarity with the ecclesiastical

interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our

inclinations for uprightness in historicis and the philosophers

support the church the lie about a moral order of the world runs

through the whole of philosophy  even the newest what is the meaning

of a moral order of the world that there is a thing called the will

of god which once and for all time determines what man ought to do and

what he ought not to do that the worth of a people or of an individual

thereof is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this

will of god that the destinies of a people or of an individual are

controlled by this will of god which rewards or punishes according to

the degree of obedience manifestedin place of all that pitiable lie

reality has this to say the priest a parasitical variety of man

who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life takes the

name of god in vain he calls that state of human society in which he

himself determines the value of all things the kingdom of god he

calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained the will of

god with coldblooded cynicism he estimates all peoples all ages and

all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the

power of the priestly order one observes him at work under the hand of

the jewish priesthood the great age of israel became an age of

decline the exile with its long series of misfortunes was 

transformed into a punishment for that great ageduring which priests

had not yet come into existence out of the powerful and wholly free

heroes of israels history they fashioned according to their changing

needs either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely godless

they reduced every great event to the idiotic formula obedient or

disobedient to godthey went a step further the will of god in

other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the

priests had to be determinedand to this end they had to have a

revelation in plain english a gigantic literary fraud had to be

perpetrated and holy scriptures had to be concoctedand so with the

utmost hierarchical pomp and days of penance and much lamentation over

the long days of sin now ended they were duly published the will of

god it appears had long stood like a rock the trouble was that

mankind had neglected the holy scriptures but the will of god

had already been revealed to moses what happened simply this the

priest had formulated once and for all time and with the strictest

meticulousness what tithes were to be paid to him from the largest to

the  smallest not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat for

the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks in brief he let it be

known just what he wanted what the will of god was from this

time forward things were so arranged that the priest became

indispensable everywhere at all the great natural events of life at

birth at marriage in sickness at death not to say at the

sacrifice that is at mealtimes the holy parasite put in his

appearance and proceeded to denaturize itin his own phrase to

sanctify it for this should be noted that every natural habit

every natural institution the state the administration of justice

marriage the care of the sick and of the poor everything demanded by

the lifeinstinct in short everything that has any value in itself

is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the reverse of

valuable by the parasitism of priests or if you chose by the moral

order of the world the fact requires a sanctiona power to grant

values becomes necessary and the only way it can create such values is

by denying nature the priest depreciates and desecrates nature it

is only at this price that he can exist at alldisobedience to god

which  actually means to the priest to the law now gets the name of

sin the means prescribed for reconciliation with god are of

course precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the

thumb of the priest he alone can save psychologically considered

sins are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical

basis they are the only reliable weapons of power the priest lives

upon sins it is necessary to him that there be sinning prime

axiom god forgiveth him that repentethin plain english him that

submitteth to the priest
27
christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything

natural every natural value every reality was opposed by the deepest

instincts of the ruling classit grew up as a sort of war to the death

upon reality and as such it has never been surpassed the holy

people who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all

things and who with a terrible logical consistency had rejected

everything of the earth as unholy worldly sinfulthis people

put its instinct into a final for mula that was logical to the point of

selfannihilation as christianity it actually denied even the last

form of reality the holy people the chosen people jewish

reality itself the phenomenon is of the first order of importance the

small insurrectionary movement which took the name of jesus of nazareth

is simply the jewish instinct redivivusin other words it is the

priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the

priest as a fact it is the discovery of a state of existence even more

fantastic than any before it of a vision of life even more unreal

than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization christianity

actually denies the church
i am unable to determine what was the target of the insurrection said to

have been led whether rightly or wrongly by jesus if it was not the

jewish churchchurch being here used in exactly the same sense that

the word has today it was an insurrection against the good and just

against the prophets of israel against the whole hierarchy of

societynot against corruption but against caste privilege order

formalism it was unbelief in superior men a nay flung at

everything  that priests and theologians stood for but the hierarchy

that was called into question if only for an instant by this movement

was the structure of piles which above everything was necessary to the

safety of the jewish people in the midst of the watersit represented

their last possibility of survival it was the final residuum of

their independent political existence an attack upon it was an attack

upon the most profound national instinct the most powerful national

will to live that has ever appeared on earth this saintly anarchist

who aroused the people of the abyss the outcasts and sinners the

chandala of judaism to rise in revolt against the established order of

thingsand in language which if the gospels are to be credited would

get him sent to siberia todaythis man was certainly a political

criminal at least in so far as it was possible to be one in so

absurdly unpolitical a community this is what brought him to the

cross the proof thereof is to be found in the inscription that was put

upon the cross he died for his own sinsthere is not the slightest

ground for believing no matter how often it is asserted that he died

for the sins of others 
28
as to whether he himself was conscious of this contradictionwhether

in fact this was the only contradiction he was cognizant ofthat is

quite another question here for the first time i touch upon the

problem of the psychology of the saviouri confess to begin with

that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the

gospels my difficulties are quite different from those which enabled

the learned curiosity of the german mind to achieve one of its most

unforgettable triumphs it is a long while since i like all other young

scholars enjoyed with all the sapient laboriousness of a fastidious

philologist the work of the incomparable strauss5 at that time i was

twenty years old now i am too serious for that sort of thing what do i

care for the contradictions of tradition how can any one call pious

legends traditions the histories of saints present the most dubious

variety of literature in existence to examine them by the scientific

method in the entire ab sence of corroborative documents seems to me

to condemn the whole inquiry from the startit is simply learned

idling
5 david friedrich strauss 180874 author of das leben

jesu 18356 a very famous work in its day nietzsche here refers to

it
29
what concerns me is the psychological type of the saviour this type

might be depicted in the gospels in however mutilated a form and

however much overladen with extraneous charactersthat is in spite

of the gospels just as the figure of francis of assisi shows itself in

his legends in spite of his legends it is not a question of mere

truthful evidence as to what he did what he said and how he actually

died the question is whether his type is still conceivable whether it

has been handed down to usall the attempts that i know of to read the

history of a soul in the gospels seem to me to reveal only a

lamentable psychological levity m renan that mountebank in

psychologicus has contributed the two most unseemly notions to this

business of explaining the type of jesus the notion of the genius and

that of the hero hros but if there is anything essentially

unevangelical it is surely the concept of the hero what the gospels

make instinctive  is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle of

all taste for conflict the very incapacity for resistance is here

converted into something moral resist not evilthe most profound

sentence in the gospels perhaps the true key to them to wit the

blessedness of peace of gentleness the inability to be an enemy

what is the meaning of glad tidingsthe true life the life eternal

has been foundit is not merely promised it is here it is in you

it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions

from all keeping of distances every one is the child of godjesus

claims nothing for himself aloneas the child of god each man is the

equal of every other man imagine making jesus a heroand what a

tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word genius our whole

conception of the spiritual the whole conception of our civilization

could have had no meaning in the world that jesus lived in in the

strict sense of the physiologist a quite different word ought to be

used here we all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the

tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every

touch and from every effort to grasp a  solid object brought to its

logical conclusion such a physiological habitus becomes an

instinctive hatred of all reality a flight into the intangible into

the incomprehensible a distaste for all formulae for all conceptions

of time and space for everything establishedcustoms institutions

the church a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of

reality survives a merely inner world a true world an eternal

world the kingdom of god is within you
30
the instinctive hatred of reality the consequence of an extreme

susceptibility to pain and irritationso great that merely to be

touched becomes unendurable for every sensation is too profound
the instinctive exclusion of all aversion all hostility all bounds

and distances in feeling the consequence of an extreme susceptibility

to pain and irritationso great that it senses all resistance all

compulsion to resistance as unbearable anguish that is to say as

harmful as prohibited by the instinct of selfpreservation and

regards blessedness joy as possible  only when it is no longer

necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything however evil or

dangerouslove as the only as the ultimate possibility of life
these are the two physiological realities upon and out of which the

doctrine of salvation has sprung i call them a sublime

superdevelopment of hedonism upon a thoroughly unsalubrious soil what

stands most closely related to them though with a large admixture of

greek vitality and nerveforce is epicureanism the theory of salvation

of paganism epicurus was a typical dcadent i was the first to

recognize himthe fear of pain even of infinitely slight painthe

end of this can be nothing save a religion of love
31
i have already given my answer to the problem the prerequisite to it is

the assumption that the type of the saviour has reached us only in a

greatly distorted form this distortion is very probable there are many

reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure

form complete and free of additions the milieu in which this strange

figure moved  must have left marks upon him and more must have been

imprinted by the history the destiny of the early christian

communities the latter indeed must have embellished the type

retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving

the purposes of war and of propaganda that strange and sickly world

into which the gospels lead usa world apparently out of a russian

novel in which the scum of society nervous maladies and childish

idiocy keep a trystmust in any case have coarsened the type the

first disciples in particular must have been forced to translate an

existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their

own crudity in order to understand it at allin their sight the type

could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar

mould the prophet the messiah the future judge the teacher of

morals the worker of wonders john the baptistall these merely

presented chances to misunderstand it finally let us not underrate

the proprium of all great and especially all sectarian veneration it

tends to erase from the venerated objects all its original traits and

idiosyncrasies often so painfully strangeit does not even see 

them it is greatly to be regretted that no dostoyevsky lived in the

neighbourhood of this most interesting dcadenti mean some one who

would have felt the poignant charm of such a compound of the sublime

the morbid and the childish in the last analysis the type as a type

of the dcadence may actually have been peculiarly complex and

contradictory such a possibility is not to be lost sight of

nevertheless the probabilities seem to be against it for in that case

tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective whereas

we have reasons for assuming the contrary meanwhile there is a

contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount the seashore

and the fields who appears like a new buddha on a soil very unlike

indias and the aggressive fanatic the mortal enemy of theologians and

ecclesiastics who stands glorified by renans malice as le grand

matre en ironie i myself havent any doubt that the greater part of

this venom and no less of esprit got itself into the concept of the

master only as a result of the excited nature of christian propaganda

we all know the unscrupulousness of sectarians when they set out to turn

their leader into an apologia  for themselves when the early

christians had need of an adroit contentious pugnacious and

maliciously subtle theologian to tackle other theologians they

created a god that met that need just as they put into his mouth

without hesitation certain ideas that were necessary to them but that

were utterly at odds with the gospelsthe second coming the last

judgment all sorts of expectations and promises current at the

time
32
i can only repeat that i set myself against all efforts to intrude the

fanatic into the figure of the saviour the very word imprieux used

by renan is alone enough to annul the type what the glad tidings

tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions the kingdom of

heaven belongs to children the faith that is voiced here is no more

an embattled faithit is at hand it has been from the beginning it is

a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit the physiologists at

all events are familiar with such a delayed and incomplete puberty in

the living organism the result of degeneration a faith of this sort is

not furious it does not de nounce it does not defend itself it does

not come with the swordit does not realize how it will one day set

man against man it does not manifest itself either by miracles or by

rewards and promises or by scriptures it is itself first and last

its own miracle its own reward its own promise its own kingdom of

god this faith does not formulate itselfit simply lives and so

guards itself against formulae to be sure the accident of environment

of educational background gives prominence to concepts of a certain

sort in primitive christianity one finds only concepts of a

judaeosemitic character that of eating and drinking at the last

supper belongs to this categoryan idea which like everything else

jewish has been badly mauled by the church but let us be careful not

to see in all this anything more than symbolical language semantics6

an opportunity to speak in parables it is only on the theory that no

work is to be taken literally that this antirealist is able to speak at

all set down among hindus he would have made use of the concepts of

sankhya7 and among chinese  he would have employed those of

laotse8and in neither case would it have made any difference to

himwith a little freedom in the use of words one might actually call

jesus a free spirit9he cares nothing for what is established the

word killeth10 whatever is established killeth the idea of

life as an experience as he alone conceives it stands opposed to

his mind to every sort of word formula law belief and dogma he

speaks only of inner things life or truth or light is his word

for the innermostin his sight everything else the whole of reality

all nature even language has significance only as sign as

allegoryhere it is of paramount importance to be led into no error by

the temptations lying in christian or rather ecclesiastical

prejudices such a symbolism par excellence stands outside all

religion all notions of worship all history all natural science all

worldly experience all knowledge all politics all psychology all

books all arthis wisdom is precisely a pure  ignorance11 of all

such things he has never heard of culture he doesnt have to make

war on ithe doesnt even deny it the same thing may be said of the

state of the whole bourgeoise social order of labour of warhe has

no ground for denying the world for he knows nothing of the

ecclesiastical concept of the world denial is precisely the

thing that is impossible to himin the same way he lacks argumentative

capacity and has no belief that an article of faith a truth may be

established by proofs his proofs are inner lights subjective

sensations of happiness and selfapproval simple proofs of power

such a doctrine cannot contradict it doesnt know that other

doctrines exist or can exist and is wholly incapable of imagining

anything opposed to it if anything of the sort is ever encountered

it laments the blindness with sincere sympathyfor it alone has

lightbut it does not offer objections

semantik is what nietzsche had in mind

9 nietzsches name for one accepting his own philosophy
10 that is the strict letter of the lawthe chief target of

33
in the whole psychology of the gospels the concepts of guilt and

punishment are lacking  and so is that of reward sin which means

anything that puts a distance between god and man is abolishedthis

is precisely the glad tidings eternal bliss is not merely promised

nor is it bound up with conditions it is conceived as the only

realitywhat remains consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it
the results of such a point of view project themselves into a new way

of life the special evangelical way of life it is not a belief that

marks off the christian he is distinguished by a different mode of

action he acts differently he offers no resistance either by word

or in his heart to those who stand against him he draws no distinction

between strangers and countrymen jews and gentiles neighbour of

course means fellowbeliever jew he is angry with no one and he

despises no one he neither appeals to the courts of justice nor heeds

their mandates swear not at all12 he never under any

circumstances divorces his wife even when he has proofs of her

infidelityand under all of this is one principle all of it arises

from one instinct
12 matthew v 34
the life of the saviour was simply a carrying  out of this way of

lifeand so was his death he no longer needed any formula or ritual

in his relations with godnot even prayer he had rejected the whole of

the jewish doctrine of repentance and atonement he knew that it was

only by a way of life that one could feel ones self divine

blessed evangelical a child of god not by repentance not

by prayer and forgiveness is the way to god only the gospel way

leads to godit is itself godwhat the gospels abolished was

the judaism in the concepts of sin forgiveness of sin faith

salvation through faiththe whole ecclesiastical dogma of the jews

was denied by the glad tidings
the deep instinct which prompts the christian how to live so that he

will feel that he is in heaven and is immortal despite many reasons

for feeling that he is not in heaven this is the only psychological

reality in salvationa new way of life not a new faith
34
if i understand anything at all about this great symbolist it is this

that he regarded only subjective realities as realities as

truths that he saw everything else everything natural temporal

spatial and historical merely as signs as materials for parables the

concept of the son of god does not connote a concrete person in

history an isolated and definite individual but an eternal fact a

psychological symbol set free from the concept of time the same thing

is true and in the highest sense of the god of this typical

symbolist of the kingdom of god and of the sonship of god nothing

could be more unchristian than the crude ecclesiastical notions of

god as a person of a kingdom of god that is to come of a kingdom

of heaven beyond and of a son of god as the second person of the

trinity all thisif i may be forgiven the phraseis like thrusting

ones fist into the eye and what an eye of the gospels a disrespect

for symbols amounting to worldhistorical cynicism but it is

nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols father and

sonnot of course to every one the word son expresses

entrance into the feeling that there is a general transformation of

all things beatitude and father expresses that feeling

itselfthe sensation of eternity and of perfectioni am  ashamed to

remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism has it not set

an amphitryon story13 at the threshold of the christian faith and a

dogma of immaculate conception for good measure and thereby it

has robbed conception of its immaculateness
13 amphitryon was the son of alcaeus king of

tiryns his wife was alcmene during his absence she was visited by

zeus and bore heracles
the kingdom of heaven is a state of the heartnot something to come

beyond the world or after death the whole idea of natural death is

absent from the gospels death is not a bridge not a passing it is

absent because it belongs to a quite different a merely apparent world

useful only as a symbol the hour of death is not a christian

ideahours time the physical life and its crises have no existence

for the bearer of glad tidings the kingdom of god is not

something that men wait for it had no yesterday and no day after

tomorrow it is not going to come at a millenniumit is an experience

of the heart it is everywhere and it is nowhere
 35
this bearer of glad tidings died as he lived and taughtnot to

save mankind but to show mankind how to live it was a way of life

that he bequeathed to man his demeanour before the judges before the

officers before his accusershis demeanour on the cross he does not

resist he does not defend his rights he makes no effort to ward off

the most extreme penaltymore he invites it and he prays

suffers and loves with those in those who do him evil not to

defend ones self not to show anger not to lay blames on the

contrary to submit even to the evil oneto love him
36
we free spiritswe are the first to have the necessary prerequisite

to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstoodthat

instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the holy lie

even more than upon all other lies mankind was unspeakably far from

our benevolent and cautious neutrality from that discipline of the

spirit which alone  makes possible the solution of such strange and

subtle things what men always sought with shameless egoism was their

own advantage therein they created the church out of denial of the

gospels
whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinitys hand in the great

drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the

stupendous questionmark that is called christianity that mankind

should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the

origin the meaning and the law of the gospelsthat in the concept of

the church the very things should be pronounced holy that the bearer

of glad tidings regards as beneath him and behind himit would be

impossible to surpass this as a grand example of worldhistorical

irony
37
our age is proud of its historical sense how then could it delude

itself into believing that the crude fable of the wonderworker and

saviour constituted the beginnings of christianityand that everything

spiritual and symbolical in it only came later quite to the contrary

the whole history of christianityfrom the  death on the cross

onwardis the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of

an original symbolism with every extension of christianity among

larger and ruder masses even less capable of grasping the principles

that gave birth to it the need arose to make it more and more vulgar

and barbarousit absorbed the teachings and rites of all the

subterranean cults of the imperium romanum and the absurdities

engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning it was the fate of

christianity that its faith had to become as sickly as low and as

vulgar as the needs were sickly low and vulgar to which it had to

administer a sickly barbarism finally lifts itself to power as the

churchthe church that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty

to all loftiness of soul to all discipline of the spirit to all

spontaneous and kindly humanitychristian valuesnoble values it

is only we we free spirits who have reestablished this greatest of

all antitheses in values
38
i cannot at this place avoid a sigh there are days when i am

visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholycontempt of

man  let me leave no doubt as to what i despise whom i despise

it is the man of today the man with whom i am unhappily

contemporaneous the man of todayi am suffocated by his foul

breath toward the past like all who understand i am full of

tolerance which is to say generous selfcontrol with gloomy caution

i pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world call it

christianity christian faith or the christian church as you

willi take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies but

my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment i enter modern

times our times our age knows better what was formerly merely

sickly now becomes indecentit is indecent to be a christian today

and here my disgust beginsi look about me not a word survives of

what was once called truth we can no longer bear to hear a priest

pronounce the word even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to

integrity must know that a theologian a priest a pope of today not

only errs when he speaks but actually liesand that he no longer

escapes blame for his lie through innocence or ignorance the priest

knows  as every one knows that there is no longer any god or any

sinner or any saviourthat free will and the moral order of the

world are lies serious reflection the profound selfconquest of the

spirit allow no man to pretend that he does not know it all

the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they areas the

worst counterfeits in existence invented to debase nature and all

natural values the priest himself is seen as he actually isas the

most dangerous form of parasite as the venomous spider of creation

we know our conscience now knowsjust what the real value of all

those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends

they have served with their debasement of humanity to a state of

selfpollution the very sight of which excites loathingthe concepts

the other world the last judgment the immortality of the soul

the soul itself they are all merely so many instruments of torture

systems of cruelty whereby the priest becomes master and remains

master every one knows this but nevertheless things remain as

before what has become of the last trace of decent feeling of

selfrespect when our statesmen otherwise an unconventional  class of

men and thoroughly antichristian in their acts now call themselves

christians and go to the communiontable a prince at the head of his

armies magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his

peopleand yet acknowledging without any shame that he is a

christian whom then does christianity deny what does it call

the world to be a soldier to be a judge to be a patriot to

defend ones self to be careful of ones honour to desire ones own

advantage to be proud  every act of everyday every instinct

every valuation that shows itself in a deed is now antichristian

what a monster of falsehood the modern man must be to call himself

nevertheless and without shame a christian
39
i shall go back a bit and tell you the authentic history of

christianitythe very word christianity is a misunderstandingat

bottom there was only one christian and he died on the cross the

gospels died on the cross what from that moment onward was called

the gospels was the very reverse of  what he had lived bad

tidings a dysangelium14 it is an error amounting to

nonsensicality to see in faith and particularly in faith in salvation

through christ the distinguishing mark of the christian only the

christian way of life the life lived by him who died on the cross

is christian to this day such a life is still possible and for

certain men even necessary genuine primitive christianity will

remain possible in all ages not faith but acts above all an

avoidance of acts a different state of being states of

consciousness faith of a sort the acceptance for example of anything

as trueas every psychologist knows the value of these things is

perfectly indifferent and fifthrate compared to that of the instincts

strictly speaking the whole concept of intellectual causality is false

to reduce being a christian the state of christianity to an acceptance

of truth to a mere phenomenon of consciousness is to formulate the

negation of christianity in fact there are no christians the

christianhe who for two thousand years has passed as a christianis

simply a psycho logical selfdelusion closely examined it appears

that despite all his faith he has been ruled only by his

instinctsand what instinctsin all agesfor example in the case

of lutherfaith has been no more than a cloak a pretense a

curtain behind which the instincts have played their gamea shrewd

blindness to the domination of certain of the instincts i have

already called faith the specially christian form of

shrewdnesspeople always talk of their faith and act according

to their instincts in the world of ideas of the christian there is

nothing that so much as touches reality on the contrary one recognizes

an instinctive hatred of reality as the motive power the only motive

power at the bottom of christianity what follows therefrom that even

here in psychologicis there is a radical error which is to say one

conditioning fundamentals which is to say one in substance take

away one idea and put a genuine reality in its placeand the whole of

christianity crumbles to nothingnessviewed calmly this strangest of

all phenomena a religion not only depending on errors but inventive

and ingenious only in devising injurious  errors poisonous to life

and to the heartthis remains a spectacle for the godsfor those

gods who are also philosophers and whom i have encountered for

example in the celebrated dialogues at naxos at the moment when their

disgust leaves them and us they will be thankful for the

spectacle afforded by the christians perhaps because of this curious

exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a

glance from omnipotence a show of divine interest therefore let us

not underestimate the christians the christian false to the point of

innocence is far above the apein its application to the christians a

wellknown theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness

40
the fate of the gospels was decided by deathit hung on the cross it was only death that unexpected and shameful death it was only

the cross which was usually reserved for the canaille onlyit was only

this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the

real riddle who was it what was itthe feeling of dis may of

profound affront and injury the suspicion that such a death might

involve a refutation of their cause the terrible question why just

in this waythis state of mind is only too easy to understand here

everything must be accounted for as necessary everything must have a

meaning a reason the highest sort of reason the love of a disciple

excludes all chance only then did the chasm of doubt yawn who put

him to death who was his natural enemythis question flashed like a

lightningstroke answer dominant judaism its ruling class from that

moment one found ones self in revolt against the established order

and began to understand jesus as in revolt against the established

order until then this militant this naysaying naydoing element in

his character had been lacking what is more he had appeared to present

its opposite obviously the little community had not understood what

was precisely the most important thing of all the example offered by

this way of dying the freedom from and superiority to every feeling of

ressentimenta plain indication of how little he was understood at

all all that jesus could hope to accomplish by his death in itself

was  to offer the strongest possible proof or example of his

teachings in the most public manner but his disciples were very far

from forgiving his deaththough to have done so would have accorded

with the gospels in the highest degree and neither were they prepared

to offer themselves with gentle and serene calmness of heart for a

similar death on the contrary it was precisely the most

unevangelical of feelings revenge that now possessed them it seemed

impossible that the cause should perish with his death recompense and

judgment became necessary yet what could be less evangelical than

recompense punishment and sitting in judgment once more the

popular belief in the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground

attention was rivetted upon an historical moment the kingdom of god

is to come with judgment upon his enemies but in all this there was

a wholesale misunderstanding imagine the kingdom of god as a last

act as a mere promise the gospels had been in fact the incarnation

the fulfilment the realization of this kingdom of god it was only

now that all the familiar contempt for and bitterness against pharisees

and theologians began to appear in  the character of the masterhe was

thereby turned into a pharisee and theologian himself on the other

hand the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced souls could

no longer endure the gospel doctrine taught by jesus of the equal

right of all men to be children of god their revenge took the form of

elevating jesus in an extravagant fashion and thus separating him

from themselves just as in earlier times the jews to revenge

themselves upon their enemies separated themselves from their god and

placed him on a great height the one god and the only son of god both

were products of ressentiment
41
and from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself how

could god allow it to which the deranged reason of the little

community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity god

gave his son as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins at once there

was an end of the gospels sacrifice for sin and in its most obnoxious

and barbarous form sacrifice of the innocent for the sins of the

guilty what appalling paganismjesus him self had done away with the

very concept of guilt he denied that there was any gulf fixed between

god and man he lived this unity between god and man and that was

precisely his glad tidings and not as a mere privilegefrom

this time forward the type of the saviour was corrupted bit by bit by

the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming the doctrine of death

as a sacrifice the doctrine of the resurrection by means of which

the entire concept of blessedness the whole and only reality of the

gospels is juggled awayin favour of a state of existence after

death st paul with that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in

all his doings gave a logical quality to that conception that

indecent conception in this way if christ did not rise from the

dead then all our faith is in vainand at once there sprang from the

gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises the

shameless doctrine of personal immortality paul even preached it

as a reward
42
one now begins to see just what it was that came to an end with the

death on the cross a  new and thoroughly original effort to found a

buddhistic peace movement and so establish happiness on earthreal

not merely promised for this remainsas i have already pointed

outthe essential difference between the two religions of dcadence

buddhism promises nothing but actually fulfils christianity promises

everything but fulfils nothinghard upon the heels of the glad

tidings came the worst imaginable those of paul in paul is incarnated

the very opposite of the bearer of glad tidings he represents the

genius for hatred the vision of hatred the relentless logic of hatred

what indeed has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred above

all the saviour he nailed him to his own cross the life the

example the teaching the death of christ the meaning and the law of

the whole gospelsnothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter

in hatred had reduced it to his uses surely not reality surely not

historical truth once more the priestly instinct of the jew

perpetrated the same old master crime against historyhe simply struck

out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of christianity and

invented his own history of christian beginnings going  further he

treated the history of israel to another falsification so that it

became a mere prologue to his achievement all the prophets it now

appeared had referred to his saviour later on the church even

falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to

christianity the figure of the saviour his teaching his way of

life his death the meaning of his death even the consequences of his

deathnothing remained untouched nothing remained in even remote

contact with reality paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that

whole life to a place behind this existencein the lie of the

risen jesus at bottom he had no use for the life of the

saviourwhat he needed was the death on the cross and something

more to see anything honest in such a man as paul whose home was at

the centre of the stoical enlightenment when he converts an

hallucination into a proof of the resurrection of the saviour or even

to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination

himselfthis would be a genuine niaiserie in a psychologist paul

willed the end therefore he also willed the means what he himself

didnt believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he 

spread his teachingwhat he wanted was power in paul the priest

once more reached out for powerhe had use only for such concepts

teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the

masses and organizing mobs what was the only part of christianity

that mohammed borrowed later on pauls invention his device for

establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob the belief in the

immortality of the soulthat is to say the doctrine of

judgment
43
when the centre of gravity of life is placed not in life itself but

in the beyondin nothingnessthen one has taken away its centre of

gravity altogether the vast lie of personal immortality destroys all

reason all natural instincthenceforth everything in the instincts

that is beneficial that fosters life and that safeguards the future is

a cause of suspicion so to live that life no longer has any meaning

this is now the meaning of life why be publicspirited why take

any pride in descent and forefathers why labour together trust one

another or concern  ones self about the common welfare and try to

serve it merely so many temptations so many strayings from the

straight pathone thing only is necessary that every man

because he has an immortal soul is as good as every other man that

in an infinite universe of things the salvation of every individual

may lay claim to eternal importance that insignificant bigots and the

threefourths insane may assume that the laws of nature are constantly

suspended in their behalfit is impossible to lavish too much

contempt upon such a magnification of every sort of selfishness to

infinity to insolence and yet christianity has to thank precisely

this miserable flattery of personal vanity for its triumphit was

thus that it lured all the botched the dissatisfied the fallen upon

evil days the whole refuse and offscouring of humanity to its side

the salvation of the soulin plain english the world revolves

around me the poisonous doctrine equal rights for all has

been propagated as a christian principle out of the secret nooks and

crannies of bad instinct christianity has waged a deadly war upon all

feelings of reverence and distance between man and man  which is to

say upon the first prerequisite to every step upward to every

development of civilizationout of the ressentiment of the masses it

has forged its chief weapons against us against everything noble

joyous and highspirited on earth against our happiness on earth to

allow immortality to every peter and paul was the greatest the most

vicious outrage upon noble humanity ever perpetratedand let us

not underestimate the fatal influence that christianity has had even

upon politics nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights

for the right of dominion for feelings of honourable pride in himself

and his equalsfor the pathos of distance our politics is sick

with this lack of couragethe aristocratic attitude of mind has been

undermined by the lie of the equality of souls and if belief in the

privileges of the majority makes and will continue to make

revolutionsit is christianity let us not doubt and christian

valuations which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood and

crime christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the

ground against everything that is lofty the gospel of the lowly

lowers
 44
the gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was

already persistent within the primitive community that which paul

with the cynical logic of a rabbi later developed to a conclusion was

at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the

saviourthese gospels cannot be read too carefully difficulties lurk

behind every word i confessi hope it will not be held against

methat it is precisely for this reason that they offer firstrate joy

to a psychologistas the opposite of all merely nave corruption as

refinement par excellence as an artistic triumph in psychological

corruption the gospels in fact stand alone the bible as a whole is

not to be compared to them here we are among jews this is the first

thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the

matter this positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal

holiness unmatched anywhere else either in books or by men this

elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an artall

this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual or

to any violation of nature  the thing responsible is race the whole

of judaism appears in christianity as the art of concocting holy lies

and there after many centuries of earnest jewish training and hard

practice of jewish technic the business comes to the stage of mastery

the christian that ultima ratio of lying is the jew all over

againhe is threefold the jew the underlying will to make use

only of such concepts symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly

practice the instinctive repudiation of every other mode of thought

and every other method of estimating values and utilitiesthis is not

only tradition it is inheritance only as an inheritance is it able

to operate with the force of nature the whole of mankind even the best

minds of the best ages with one exception perhaps hardly human

have permitted themselves to be deceived the gospels have been read as

a book of innocence  surely no small indication of the high skill

with which the trick has been doneof course if we could actually

see these astounding bigots and bogus saints even if only for an

instant the farce would come to an endand it is precisely because

i cannot read a word of theirs without seeing their attitudinizing 

that i have made an end of them i simply cannot endure the way

they have of rolling up their eyesfor the majority happily enough

books are mere literaturelet us not be led astray they say judge

not and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their way in

letting god sit in judgment they judge themselves in glorifying god

they glorify themselves in demanding that every one show the virtues

which they themselves happen to be capable ofstill more which they

must have in order to remain on topthey assume the grand air of men

struggling for virtue of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail

we live we die we sacrifice ourselves for the good the truth

the light the kingdom of god in point of fact they simply do

what they cannot help doing forced like hypocrites to be sneaky to

hide in corners to slink along in the shadows they convert their

necessity into a duty it is on grounds of duty that they account for

their lives of humility and that humility becomes merely one more proof

of their piety ah that humble chaste charitable brand of fraud

virtue itself shall bear witness for us one may read the gospels 

as books of moral seduction these petty folks fasten themselves to

moralitythey know the uses of morality morality is the best of all

devices for leading mankind by the nosethe fact is that the

conscious conceit of the chosen here disguises itself as modesty it is

in this way that they the community the good and just range

themselves once and for always on one side the side of the

truthand the rest of mankind the world on the other in that

we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever

seen little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive

rights in the concepts of god the truth the light the spirit

love wisdom and life as if these things were synonyms of

themselves and thereby they sought to fence themselves off from the

world little superjews ripe for some sort of madhouse turned

values upside down in order to meet their notions just as if the

christian were the meaning the salt the standard and even the last

judgment of all the rest the whole disaster was only made possible

by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar

megalomania allied to this one in race to wit the jewish once a

chasm  began to yawn between jews and judaeochristians the latter had

no choice but to employ the selfpreservative measures that the jewish

instinct had devised even against the jews themselves whereas the

jews had employed them only against nonjews the christian is simply a

jew of the reformed confession
45
i offer a few examples of the sort of thing these petty people have

got into their headswhat they have put into the mouth of the master

the unalloyed creed of beautiful souls
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart

thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them

verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha

in the day of judgment than for that city mark vi 11how

evangelical
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in

me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck

and he were cast into the sea mark ix 42how evangelical
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out  it is better for

thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes

to be cast into hell fire where the worm dieth not and the fire is not

quenched mark ix 4715it is not exactly the eye that is

meant
15 to which without mentioning it nietzsche adds verse 48
verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here

which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god

come with power mark ix 1well lied lion16
16 a paraphrase of demetrius well roard lion in act v

scene 1 of a midsummer nights dream the lion of course is the

familiar christian symbol for mark
whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his

cross and follow me for note of a psychologist christian

morality is refuted by its fors its reasons are against itthis

makes it christian mark viii 34
judge not that ye be not judged with what measure ye mete it shall

be measured to you again matthew vii 117what a notion of

justice of a just judge
17 nietzsche also quotes part of verse 2
for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even

the publicans the  same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye

more than others do not even the publicans so matthew v

4618principle of christian love it insists upon being well

paid in the end
18 the quotation also includes verse 47
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father

forgive your trespasses matthew vi 15very compromising for the

said father
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all

these things shall be added unto you matthew vi 33all these

things namely food clothing all the necessities of life an error

to put it mildly a bit before this god appears as a tailor at least

in certain cases
rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is

great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the

prophets luke vi 23impudent rabble it compares itself to the

prophets
know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god

dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god

destroy for the temple of god is holy which  temple ye are paul

1 corinthians iii 1619for that sort of thing one cannot have

enough contempt
19 and 17
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world

shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters

paul 1 corinthians vi 2unfortunately not merely the speech of a

lunatic this frightful impostor then proceeds know ye not that

we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life
hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in

the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by

the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe not many wise

men after the flesh not men mighty not many noble are called but

god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise

and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things

which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are

despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to

nought things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence

paul  1 corinthians i 20ff20in order to understand this

passage a firstrate example of the psychology underlying every

chandalamorality one should read the first part of my genealogy of

morals there for the first time the antagonism between a noble

morality and a morality born of ressentiment and impotent vengefulness

is exhibited paul was the greatest of all apostles of revenge
20 verses 20 21 26 27 28 29
46
what follows then that one had better put on gloves before reading

the new testament the presence of so much filth makes it very

advisable one would as little choose early christians for companions

as polish jews not that one need seek out an objection to them

neither has a pleasant smelli have searched the new testament in vain

for a single sympathetic touch nothing is there that is free kindly

openhearted or upright in it humanity does not even make the first

step upwardthe instinct for cleanliness is lacking only evil

instincts are there and there is not even the courage of these evil

instincts it is all coward ice it is all a shutting of the eyes a

selfdeception every other book becomes clean once one has read the

new testament for example immediately after reading paul i took up

with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers petronius of

whom one may say what domenico boccaccio wrote of csar borgia to the

duke of parma  tutto festoimmortally healthy immortally

cheerful and sound these petty bigots make a capital miscalculation

they attack but everything they attack is thereby distinguished

whoever is attacked by an early christian is surely not befouled

on the contrary it is an honour to have an early christian as an

opponent one cannot read the new testament without acquired admiration

for whatever it abusesnot to speak of the wisdom of this world

which an impudent windbag tries to dispose of by the foolishness of

preaching even the scribes and pharisees are benefitted by such

opposition they must certainly have been worth something to have been

hated in such an indecent manner hypocrisyas if this were a charge

that the early christians dared to makeafter all they were the

privileged and that was enough the hatred  of the chandala needed no

other excuse the early christianand also i fear the last

christian whom i may perhaps live to seeis a rebel against all

privilege by profound instincthe lives and makes war for ever for

equal rights strictly speaking he has no alternative when a man

proposes to represent in his own person the chosen of godor to be

a temple of god or a judge of the angelsthen every other

criterion whether based upon honesty upon intellect upon manliness

and pride or upon beauty and freedom of the heart becomes simply

worldlyevil in itself moral every word that comes from the

lips of an early christian is a lie and his every act is

instinctively dishonestall his values all his aims are noxious but

whoever he hates whatever he hates has real value the

christian and particularly the christian priest is thus a criterion

of values
must i add that in the whole new testament there appears but a

solitary figure worthy of honour pilate the roman viceroy to regard

a jewish imbroglio seriouslythat was quite beyond him one jew more

or lesswhat did it matter the noble scorn of a  roman before whom

the word truth was shamelessly mishandled enriched the new testament

with the only saying that has any valueand that is at once its

criticism and its destruction what is truth
47
the thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find god

either in history or in nature or behind naturebut that we regard

what has been honoured as god not as divine but as pitiable as

absurd as injurious not as a mere error but as a crime against

life we deny that god is god if any one were to show us this

christian god wed be still less inclined to believe in himin a

formula deus qualem paulus creavit dei negatiosuch a religion as

christianity which does not touch reality at a single point and which

goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point must

be inevitably the deadly enemy of the wisdom of this world which is

to say of scienceand it will give the name of good to whatever

means serve to poison calumniate and cry down all intellectual

discipline all lucidity and strictness in matters of intellectual

conscience and  all noble coolness and freedom of the mind faith as

an imperative vetoes sciencein praxi lying at any price paul

well knew that lyingthat faithwas necessary later on the church

borrowed the fact from paulthe god that paul invented for himself a

god who reduced to absurdity the wisdom of this world especially

the two great enemies of superstition philology and medicine is in

truth only an indication of pauls resolute determination to

accomplish that very thing himself to give ones own will the name of

god thorathat is essentially jewish paul wants to dispose of the

wisdom of this world his enemies are the good philologians and

physicians of the alexandrine schoolon them he makes his war as a

matter of fact no man can be a philologian or a physician without

being also antichrist that is to say as a philologian a man sees

behind the holy books and as a physician he sees behind the

physiological degeneration of the typical christian the physician says

incurable the philologian says fraud
 48
has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the

beginning of the bibleof gods mortal terror of science no one

in fact has understood it this priestbook par excellence opens as

is fitting with the great inner difficulty of the priest he faces

only one great danger ergo god faces only one great danger
the old god wholly spirit wholly the highpriest wholly perfect is

promenading his garden he is bored and trying to kill time against

boredom even gods struggle in vain21 what does he do he creates

manman is entertaining but then he notices that man is also bored

gods pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises

knows no bounds so he forthwith creates other animals gods first

mistake to man these other animals were not entertaininghe sought

dominion over them he did not want to be an animal himselfso god

created woman in the act he brought boredom to an endand also many 

other things woman was the second mistake of godwoman at bottom

is a serpent hevaevery priest knows that from woman comes every

evil in the worldevery priest knows that too ergo she is also to

blame for science it was through woman that man learned to taste

of the tree of knowledgewhat happened the old god was seized by

mortal terror man himself had been his greatest blunder he had

created a rival to himself science makes men godlikeit is all up

with priests and gods when man becomes scientificmoral science is

the forbidden per se it alone is forbidden science is the first of

sins the germ of all sins the original sin this is all there is of

moralitythou shall not knowthe rest follows from thatgods

mortal terror however did not hinder him from being shrewd how is one

to protect ones self against science for a long while this was the

capital problem answer out of paradise with man happiness leisure

foster thoughtand all thoughts are bad thoughtsman must not

thinkand so the priest invents distress death the mortal dangers of

childbirth all sorts of misery old age decrepitude above all

sicknessnothing  but devices for making war on science the troubles

of man dont allow him to think neverthelesshow terrible the

edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft invading heaven shadowing

the godswhat is to be donethe old god invents war he separates

the peoples he makes men destroy one another the priests have always

had need of war waramong other things a great disturber of

scienceincredible knowledge deliverance from the priests

prospers in spite of warso the old god comes to his final resolution

man has become scientificthere is no help for it he must be

drowned
21 a paraphrase of schillers against stupidity even gods

struggle in vain
49
i have been understood at the opening of the bible there is the

whole psychology of the priestthe priest knows of only one great

danger that is sciencethe sound comprehension of cause and effect

but science flourishes on the whole only under favourable

conditionsa man must have time he must have an overflowing

intellect in order to know therefore man must be made

unhappythis has been in all ages the logic of the priestit is 

easy to see just what by this logic was the first thing to come into

the worldsin the concept of guilt and punishment the whole

moral order of the world was set up against scienceagainst the

deliverance of man from priests man must not look outward he must

look inward he must not look at things shrewdly and cautiously to

learn about them he must not look at all he must suffer and he

must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priestaway with

physicians what is needed is a saviourthe concept of guilt and

punishment including the doctrines of grace of salvation of

forgivenesslies through and through and absolutely without

psychological realitywere devised to destroy mans sense of

causality they are an attack upon the concept of cause and

effectand not an attack with the fist with the knife with honesty

in hate and love on the contrary one inspired by the most cowardly

the most crafty the most ignoble of instincts an attack of priests

an attack of parasites the vampirism of pale subterranean

leeches when the natural consequences of an act are no longer

natural but are regarded as produced by the ghostly  creations of

superstitionby god by spirits by soulsand reckoned as merely

moral consequences as rewards as punishments as hints as lessons

then the whole groundwork of knowledge is destroyedthen the greatest

of crimes against humanity has been perpetratedi repeat that sin

mans selfdesecration par excellence was invented in order to make

science culture and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible

the priest rules through the invention of sin
50
in this place i cant permit myself to omit a psychology of belief

of the believer for the special benefit of believers if there

remain any today who do not yet know how indecent it is to be

believingor how much a sign of dcadence of a broken will to

livethen they will know it well enough tomorrow my voice reaches even

the deafit appears unless i have been incorrectly informed that

there prevails among christians a sort of criterion of truth that is

called proof by power faith makes blessed therefore it is

trueit might be objected right here that blessedness is not

dem onstrated it is merely promised it hangs upon faith as a

conditionone shall be blessed because one believes but what of

the thing that the priest promises to the believer the wholly

transcendental beyondhow is that to be demonstratedthe proof

by power thus assumed is actually no more at bottom than a belief

that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear in a

formula i believe that faith makes for blessednesstherefore it is

true but this is as far as we may go this therefore would be

absurdum itself as a criterion of truthbut let us admit for the

sake of politeness that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated

not merely hoped for and not merely promised by the suspicious

lips of a priest even so could blessednessin a technical term

pleasureever be a proof of truth so little is this true that it is

almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the

answer to the question what is true or at all events it is enough

to make that truth highly suspicious the proof by pleasure is a

proof of pleasurenothing more why in the world should it be

assumed that true judgments give more pleasure than false ones and 

that in conformity to some preestablished harmony they necessarily

bring agreeable feelings in their trainthe experience of all

disciplined and profound minds teaches the contrary man has had to

fight for every atom of the truth and has had to pay for it almost

everything that the heart that human love that human trust cling to

greatness of soul is needed for this business the service of truth is

the hardest of all serviceswhat then is the meaning of integrity

in things intellectual it means that a man must be severe with his own

heart that he must scorn beautiful feelings and that he makes every

yea and nay a matter of consciencefaith makes blessed therefore

it lies
51
the fact that faith under certain circumstances may work for

blessedness but that this blessedness produced by an ide fixe by no

means makes the idea itself true and the fact that faith actually moves

no mountains but instead raises them up where there were none before

all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a lunatic

asylum not of course to a priest for his instincts prompt him to

the lie that sickness  is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic

asylums christianity finds sickness necessary just as the greek

spirit had need of a superabundance of healththe actual ulterior

purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to make

people ill and the church itselfdoesnt it set up a catholic lunatic

asylum as the ultimate idealthe whole earth as a madhousethe sort

of religious man that the church wants is a typical dcadent the

moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked

by epidemics of nervous disorder the inner world of the religious man

is so much like the inner world of the overstrung and exhausted that

it is difficult to distinguish between them the highest states of

mind held up before mankind by christianity as of supreme worth are

actually epileptoid in formthe church has granted the name of holy

only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds in majorem dei honorem once

i ventured to designate the whole christian system of training22 in

penance and salvation now best studied in england as a method of

producing a folie circulaire upon a soil already prepared for it

which is to say a soil thoroughly unhealthy not every one may  be a

christian one is not converted to christianityone must first

be sick enough for it we others who have the courage for health

and likewise for contemptwe may well despise a religion that

teaches misunderstanding of the body that refuses to rid itself of the

superstition about the soul that makes a virtue of insufficient

nourishment that combats health as a sort of enemy devil temptation

that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a perfect

soul in a cadaver of a body and that to this end had to devise for

itself a new concept of perfection a pale sickly idiotically

ecstatic state of existence socalled holinessa holiness that is

itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished enervated and

incurably disordered body the christian movement as a european

movement was from the start no more than a general uprising of all

sorts of outcast and refuse elements who now under cover of

christianity aspire to power it does not represent the decay of a

race it represents on the contrary a conglomeration of dcadence

products from all directions crowding together and seeking one another

out it was not as has been thought the corruption of antiquity of

noble antiquity which made  christianity possible one cannot too

sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that

theory at the time when the sick and rotten chandala classes in the

whole imperium were christianized the contrary type the nobility

reached its finest and ripest development the majority became master

democracy with its christian instincts triumphed christianity

was not national it was not based on raceit appealed to all the

varieties of men disinherited by life it had its allies everywhere

christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very corethe instinct

against the healthy against health everything that is

wellconstituted proud gallant and above all beautiful gives offence

to its ears and eyes again i remind you of pauls priceless saying

and god hath chosen the weak things of the world the foolish

things of the world the base things of the world and things which

are despised23 this was the formula in hoc signo the

dcadence triumphedgod on the crossis man always to miss the

frightful inner significance of this symboleverything that suffers

everything that hangs on the cross is divine we all  hang on the

cross consequently we are divine we alone are divine

christianity was thus a victory a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed

by itchristianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of

humanity
22 the word training is in english in the text
23 1 corinthians i 27 28
52
christianity also stands in opposition to all intellectual

wellbeingsick reasoning is the only sort that it can use as

christian reasoning it takes the side of everything that is idiotic it

pronounces a curse upon intellect upon the superbia of the healthy

intellect since sickness is inherent in christianity it follows that

the typically christian state of faith must be a form of sickness

too and that all straight straightforward and scientific paths to

knowledge must be banned by the church as forbidden ways doubt is

thus a sin from the start the complete lack of psychological

cleanliness in the priestrevealed by a glance at himis a phenomenon

resulting from dcadenceone may observe in hysterical women and

in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts

delight in lying for the mere sake of lying and incapacity for looking

straight and walking  straight are symptoms of dcadence faith

means the will to avoid knowing what is true the pietist the priest of

either sex is a fraud because he is sick his instinct demands that

the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point whatever

makes for illness is good whatever issues from abundance from

superabundance from power is evil so argues the believer the

impulse to lieit is by this that i recognize every foreordained

theologiananother characteristic of the theologian is his unfitness

for philology what i here mean by philology is in a general sense

the art of reading with profitthe capacity for absorbing facts

without interpreting them falsely and without losing caution

patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them philology as

ephexis24 in interpretation whether one be dealing with books with

newspaper reports with the most fateful events or with weather

statisticsnot to mention the salvation of the soul the way in

which a theologian whether in berlin or in rome is ready to explain

say a passage of scripture or an experience or a victory by  the

national army by turning upon it the high illumination of the psalms of

david is always so daring that it is enough to make a philologian run

up a wall but what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from

suabia25 use the finger of god to convert their miserably

commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of grace a

providence and an experience of salvation the most modest exercise

of the intellect not to say of decency should certainly be enough to

convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness

of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity however small our

piety if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the

head at just the right time or got us into our carriage at the very

instant heavy rain began to fall he would seem so absurd a god that

hed have to be abolished even if he existed god as a domestic servant

as a letter carrier as an almanacmanat bottom he is a mere name for

the stupidest sort of chance divine prov idence which every third

man in educated germany still believes in is so strong an argument

against god that it would be impossible to think of a stronger and in

any case it is an argument against germans
24 that is to say scepticism among the greeks scepticism

was also occasionally called ephecticism

school of biblical criticism the leader of this school was f c baur

53
it is so little true that martyrs offer any support to the truth of

a cause that i am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything

to do with the truth at all in the very tone in which a martyr flings

what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low

a grade of intellectual honesty and such insensibility to the problem

of truth that it is never necessary to refute him truth is not

something that one man has and another man has not at best only

peasants or peasantapostles like luther can think of truth in any

such way one may rest assured that the greater the degree of a mans

intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty his

discretion on this point to know in five cases and to refuse

with delicacy to know anything further truth as the word is

understood by every prophet every sectarian every freethinker every

socialist and every churchman is simply a complete proof  that not even

a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and

selfcontrol that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest

truththe deaths of the martyrs it may be said in passing have been

misfortunes of history they have misled the conclusion that all

idiots women and plebeians come to that there must be something in a

cause for which any one goes to his death or which as under primitive

christianity sets off epidemics of deathseekingthis conclusion has

been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts upon the whole

spirit of inquiry and investigation the martyrs have damaged the

truth even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to

give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianismbut

why is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid

down his life for itan error that becomes honourable is simply an

error that has acquired one seductive charm the more do you suppose

messrs theologians that we shall give you the chance to be martyred

for your liesone best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it

on icethat is also the best way to dispose of theologians this was

precisely the world historical stupidity of all the persecutors that

they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposedthat they

made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom women are still on

their knees before an error because they have been told that some one

died on the cross for it is the cross then an argumentbut about

all these things there is one and one only who has said what has been

needed for thousands of yearszarathustra
they made signs in blood along the way that they went and their folly

taught them that the truth is proved by blood
but blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth blood poisoneth

even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and hatred in the

heart
and when one goeth through fire for his teachingwhat doth that prove

verily it is more when ones teaching cometh out of ones own

do not let yourself be deceived great intellects are sceptical

zarathustra is a sceptic the strength the freedom which proceed from

intellectual power from a superabundance of intellectual power

manifest themselves as scep ticism men of fixed convictions do not

count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and

lack of values men of convictions are prisoners they do not see far

enough they do not see what is below them whereas a man who would

talk to any purpose about value and nonvalue must be able to see five

hundred convictions beneath himand behind him a mind that

aspires to great things and that wills the means thereto is

necessarily sceptical freedom from any sort of conviction belongs to

strength and to an independent point of view that grand passion

which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptics existence

and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself

drafts the whole of his intellect into its service it makes him

unscrupulous it gives him courage to employ unholy means under certain

circumstances it does not begrudge him even convictions conviction as

a means one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction a grand

passion makes use of and uses up convictions it does not yield to

themit knows itself to be sovereignon the contrary the need of

faith of something unconditioned by yea or nay of carlylism  if i may

be allowed the word is a need of weakness the man of faith the

believer of any sort is necessarily a dependent mansuch a man

cannot posit himself as a goal nor can he find goals within himself

the believer does not belong to himself he can only be a means to an

end he must be used up he needs some one to use him up his instinct

gives the highest honours to an ethic of selfeffacement he is prompted

to embrace it by everything his prudence his experience his vanity

every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of selfeffacement of

selfestrangement when one reflects how necessary it is to the great

majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and

hold them fast and to what extent control or in a higher sense

slavery is the one and only condition which makes for the wellbeing

of the weakwilled man and especially woman then one at once

understands conviction and faith to the man with convictions they are

his backbone to avoid seeing many things to be impartial about

nothing to be a party man through and through to estimate all values

strictly and infalliblythese are conditions necessary to the existence

of such a man  but by the same token they are antagonists of the

truthful manof the truth the believer is not free to answer the

question true or not true according to the dictates of his own

conscience integrity on this point would work his instant downfall

the pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions

into a fanaticsavonarola luther rousseau robespierre

saintsimonthese types stand in opposition to the strong

emancipated spirit but the grandiose attitudes of these sick

intellects these intellectual epileptics are of influence upon the

great massesfanatics are picturesque and mankind prefers observing

poses to listening to reasons
55
one step further in the psychology of conviction of faith it is

now a good while since i first proposed for consideration the question

whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than

lies human alltoohuman i aphorism 48327 this time i desire

to put the question definitely is there  any actual difference between

a lie and a convictionall the world believes that there is but what

is not believed by all the worldevery conviction has its history its

primitive forms its stage of tentativeness and error it becomes a

conviction only after having been for a long time not one and then

for an even longer time hardly one what if falsehood be also one of

these embryonic forms of convictionsometimes all that is needed is a

change in persons what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in

the soni call it lying to refuse to see what one sees or to refuse

to see it as it is whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not

before witnesses is of no consequence the most common sort of lie is

that by which a man deceives himself the deception of others is a

relatively rare offencenow this will not to see what one sees

this will not to see it as it is is almost the first requisite for

all who belong to a party of whatever sort the party man becomes

inevitably a liar for example the german historians are convinced that

rome was synonymous with despotism and that the germanic peoples brought

the spirit of liberty into the world what is the difference between

this conviction and a  lie is it to be wondered at that all partisans

including the german historians instinctively roll the fine phrases of

morality upon their tonguesthat morality almost owes its very

survival to the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it

every momentthis is our conviction we publish it to the whole

world we live and die for itlet us respect all who have

convictionsi have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of

antisemites on the contrary gentlemen an antisemite surely does not

become more respectable because he lies on principle the priests

who have more finesse in such matters and who well understand the

objection that lies against the notion of a conviction which is to say

of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle because it serves a

purpose have borrowed from the jews the shrewd device of sneaking in

the concepts god the will of god and the revelation of god at

this place kant too with his categorical imperative was on the same

road this was his practical reason28 there are questions regarding

the truth or untruth of which it is not  for man to decide all the

capital questions all the capital problems of valuation are beyond

human reason to know the limits of reasonthat alone is genuine

philosophy why did god make a revelation to man would god have done

anything superfluous man could not find out for himself what was good

and what was evil so god taught him his will moral the priest does

not liethe question true or untrue has nothing to do with such

things as the priest discusses it is impossible to lie about these

things in order to lie here it would be necessary to know what is

true but this is more than man can know therefore the priest is

simply the mouthpiece of godsuch a priestly syllogism

is by no means merely jewish and christian the right to lie and the

shrewd dodge of revelation belong to the general priestly typeto

the priest of the dcadence as well as to the priest of pagan times

pagans are all those who say yes to life and to whom god is a word

signifying acquiescence in all thingsthe law the will of god

the holy book and inspirationall these things are merely words

for the conditions under which the priest comes to power and with

which he  maintains his powerthese concepts are to be found at the

bottom of all priestly organizations and of all priestly or

priestlyphilosophical schemes of governments the holy liecommon

alike to confucius to the code of manu to mohammed and to the

christian churchis not even wanting in plato truth is here this

means no matter where it is heard the priest lies
27 the aphorism which is headed the enemies of truth

makes the direct statement convictions are more dangerous enemies of

truth than lies
28 a reference of course to kants kritik der praktischen

vernunft critique of practical reason
56
in the last analysis it comes to this what is the end of lying the

fact that in christianity holy ends are not visible is my

objection to the means it employs only bad ends appear the

poisoning the calumniation the denial of life the despising of the

body the degradation and selfcontamination of man by the concept of

sintherefore its means are also badi have a contrary feeling

when i read the code of manu an incomparably more intellectual and

superior work which it would be a sin against the intelligence to so

much as name in the same breath with the bible it is easy to see why

there is a genuine philosophy behind it in it not merely an

evilsmelling mess of jewish rabbinism and  superstitionit gives even

the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into and

not to forget what is most important it differs fundamentally from

every kind of bible by means of it the nobles the philosophers and

the warriors keep the whiphand over the majority it is full of noble

valuations it shows a feeling of perfection an acceptance of life and

triumphant feeling toward self and lifethe sun shines upon the whole

bookall the things on which christianity vents its fathomless

vulgarityfor example procreation women and marriageare here

handled earnestly with reverence and with love and confidence how can

any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which

contains such vile things as this to avoid fornication let every man

have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband  it is

better to marry than to burn29 and is it possible to be a

christian so long as the origin of man is christianized which is to

say befouled by the doctrine of the immaculata conceptio i

know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of

women as in the code of manu these old  greybeards and saints have a

way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible perhaps to

surpass the mouth of a woman it says in one place the breasts of a

maiden the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always

pure in another place there is nothing purer than the light of the

sun the shadow cast by a cow air water fire and the breath of a

maiden finally in still another placeperhaps this is also a holy

lie all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure and all

below are impure only in the maiden is the whole body pure
29 1 corinthians vii 2 9
57
one catches the unholiness of christian means in flagranti by the

simple process of putting the ends sought by christianity beside the

ends sought by the code of manuby putting these enormously

antithetical ends under a strong light the critic of christianity

cannot evade the necessity of making christianity contemptiblea

book of laws such as the code of manu has the same origin as every other

good lawbook it epitomizes the experience the sagacity and the

ethical experimentation of long centuries it brings  things to a

conclusion it no longer creates the prerequisite to a codification of

this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the

authority of a slowly and painfully attained truth are fundamentally

different from those which one would make use of to prove it a lawbook

never recites the utility the grounds the casuistical antecedents of a

law for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone the thou

shall on which obedience is based the problem lies exactly hereat

a certain point in the evolution of a people the class within it of the

greatest insight which is to say the greatest hindsight and foresight

declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall

liveor can livehas come to an end the object now is to reap as

rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment

and hard experience in consequence the thing that is to be avoided

above everything is further experimentationthe continuation of the

state in which values are fluent and are tested chosen and criticized

ad infinitum against this a double wall is set up on the one hand

revelation which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the

laws are not of human origin that they were not sought  out and

found by a slow process and after many errors but that they are of

divine ancestry and came into being complete perfect without a

history as a free gift a miracle and on the other hand

tradition which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged

from time immemorial and that it is impious and a crime against ones

forefathers to bring it into question the authority of the law is thus

grounded on the thesis god gave it and the fathers lived itthe

higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract

consciousness step by step from its concern with notions of right

living that is to say those that have been proved to be right by

wide and carefully considered experience so that instinct attains to a

perfect automatisma primary necessity to every sort of mastery to

every sort of perfection in the art of life to draw up such a lawbook

as manus means to lay before a people the possibility of future

mastery of attainable perfectionit permits them to aspire to the

highest reaches of the art of life to that end the thing must be made

unconscious that is the aim of every holy liethe order of castes

the highest the dominating law is merely the ratification of an order

of nature of a natural  law of the first rank over which no arbitrary

fiat no modern idea can exert any influence in every healthy

society there are three physiological types gravitating toward

differentiation but mutually conditioning one another and each of these

has its own hygiene its own sphere of work its own special mastery and

feeling of perfection it is not manu but nature that sets off in one

class those who are chiefly intellectual in another those who are

marked by muscular strength and temperament and in a third those who

are distinguished in neither one way or the other but show only

mediocritythe lastnamed represents the great majority and the first

two the select the superior castei call it the fewesthas as the

most perfect the privileges of the few it stands for happiness for

beauty for everything good upon earth only the most intellectual of

men have any right to beauty to the beautiful only in them can

goodness escape being weakness pulchrum est paucorum hominum30

goodness is a privilege nothing could be more unbecoming to them than

uncouth manners or a pessimistic look or an eye that sees

uglinessor indignation against the general aspect of things

indigna tion is the privilege of the chandala so is pessimism the

world is perfectso prompts the instinct of the intellectual the

instinct of the man who says yes to life imperfection whatever is

inferior to us distance the pathos of distance even the chandala

themselves are parts of this perfection the most intelligent men like

the strongest find their happiness where others would find only

disaster in the labyrinth in being hard with themselves and with

others in effort their delight is in selfmastery in them asceticism

becomes second nature a necessity an instinct they regard a difficult

task as a privilege it is to them a recreation to play with burdens

that would crush all others knowledgea form of asceticismthey

are the most honourable kind of men but that does not prevent them

being the most cheerful and most amiable they rule not because they

want to but because they are they are not at liberty to play

secondthe second caste to this belong the guardians of the law

the keepers of order and security the more noble warriors above all

the king as the highest form of warrior judge and preserver of the law

the second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals

the  next to them in rank taking from them all that is rough in the

business of rulingtheir followers their right hand their most apt

disciplesin all this i repeat there is nothing arbitrary nothing

made up whatever is to the contrary is made upby it nature is

brought to shame the order of castes the order of rank simply

formulates the supreme law of life itself the separation of the three

types is necessary to the maintenance of society and to the evolution

of higher types and the highest typesthe inequality of rights is

essential to the existence of any rights at alla right is a

privilege every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of

existence let us not underestimate the privileges of the mediocre

life is always harder as one mounts the heightsthe cold increases

responsibility increases a high civilization is a pyramid it can stand

only on a broad base its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly

consolidated mediocrity the handicrafts commerce agriculture

science the greater part of art in brief the whole range of

occupational activities are compatible only with mediocre ability and

aspiration such callings would be out of place for exceptional men the

instincts  which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as

to anarchism the fact that a man is publicly useful that he is a

wheel a function is evidence of a natural predisposition it is not

society but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable

of that makes them intelligent machines to the mediocre mediocrity is

a form of happiness they have a natural instinct for mastering one

thing for specialization it would be altogether unworthy of a profound

intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself it is

in fact the first prerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional

it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization when the

exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than

he applies to himself or to his equals this is not merely kindness of

heartit is simply his duty whom do i hate most heartily among

the rabbles of today the rabble of socialists the apostles to the

chandala who undermine the workingmans instincts his pleasure his

feeling of contentment with his petty existencewho make him envious

and teach him revenge wrong never lies in unequal rights it lies in

the assertion of equal rights what is bad but i have  already

answered all that proceeds from weakness from envy from

revengethe anarchist and the christian have the same ancestry
30 few men are noble
58
in point of fact the end for which one lies makes a great difference

whether one preserves thereby or destroys there is a perfect likeness

between christian and anarchist their object their instinct points

only toward destruction one need only turn to history for a proof of

this there it appears with appalling distinctness we have just studied

a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the

conditions which cause life to flourish into an eternal social

organizationchristianity found its mission in putting an end to such

an organization because life flourished under it there the benefits

that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity

were applied to the most remote uses and an effort was made to bring in

a harvest that should be as large as rich and as complete as possible

here on the contrary the harvest is blighted overnight that

which stood there aere perennis the imperium romanum the most

magnificent form of  organization under difficult conditions that has

ever been achieved and compared to which everything before it and after

it appears as patchwork bungling dilletantismthose holy anarchists

made it a matter of piety to destroy the world which is to say

the imperium romanum so that in the end not a stone stood upon

anotherand even germans and other such louts were able to become its

masters the christian and the anarchist both are dcadents both

are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating poisonous

degenerating bloodsucking both have an instinct of mortal hatred

of everything that stands up and is great and has durability and

promises life a future christianity was the vampire of the imperium

romanumovernight it destroyed the vast achievement of the romans

the conquest of the soil for a great culture that could await its

time can it be that this fact is not yet understood the imperium

romanum that we know and that the history of the roman provinces

teaches us to know better and betterthis most admirable of all works

of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning and the structure

to follow was not to prove its worth for thousands of years to this

day noth ing on a like scale sub specie aeterni has been brought into

being or even dreamed ofthis organization was strong enough to

withstand bad emperors the accident of personality has nothing to do

with such thingsthe first principle of all genuinely great

architecture but it was not strong enough to stand up against the

corruptest of all forms of corruptionagainst christians these

stealthy worms which under the cover of night mist and duplicity

crept upon every individual sucking him dry of all earnest interest in

real things of all instinct for realitythis cowardly effeminate

and sugarcoated gang gradually alienated all souls step by step

from that colossal edifice turning against it all the meritorious

manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of rome their own

cause their own serious purpose their own pride the sneakishness of

hypocrisy the secrecy of the conventicle concepts as black as hell

such as the sacrifice of the innocent the unio mystica in the

drinking of blood above all the slowly rekindled fire of revenge of

chandala revengeall that sort of thing became master of rome the

same kind of religion which in a preexistent form epicurus had

combatted one has but to  read lucretius to know what epicurus made

war uponnot paganism but christianity which is to say the

corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt punishment and

immortalityhe combatted the subterranean cults the whole of latent

christianityto deny immortality was already a form of genuine

salvationepicurus had triumphed and every respectable intellect in

rome was epicureanwhen paul appeared  paul the chandala hatred

of rome of the world in the flesh and inspired by geniusthe jew

the eternal jew par excellence what he saw was how with the aid

of the small sectarian christian movement that stood apart from judaism

a world conflagration might be kindled how with the symbol of god

on the cross all secret seditions all the fruits of anarchistic

intrigues in the empire might be amalgamated into one immense power

salvation is of the jewschristianity is the formula for exceeding

and summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties that of

osiris that of the great mother that of mithras for instance in his

discernment of this fact the genius of paul showed itself his instinct

was here so sure that with reckless violence to the truth he put  the

ideas which lent fascination to every sort of chandala religion into the

mouth of the saviour as his own inventions and not only into the

mouthhe made out of him something that even a priest of mithras

could understand this was his revelation at damascus he grasped the

fact that he needed the belief in immortality in order to rob the

world of its value that the concept of hell would master romethat

the notion of a beyond is the death of life nihilist and

christian they rhyme in german and they do more than rhyme
59
the whole labour of the ancient world gone for naught i have no word

to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in meand

considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory that with

adamantine selfconsciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to

go on for thousands of years the whole meaning of antiquity

disappears to what end the greeks to what end the romansall the

prerequisites to a learned culture all the methods of science were

already there man had already perfected the great and incomparable art

of read ing profitablythat first necessity to the tradition of

culture the unity of the sciences the natural sciences in alliance

with mathematics and mechanics were on the right roadthe sense of

fact the last and more valuable of all the senses had its schools

and its traditions were already centuries old is all this properly

understood every essential to the beginning of the work was

readyand the most essential it cannot be said too often are

methods and also the most difficult to develop and the longest opposed

by habit and laziness what we have today reconquered with unspeakable

selfdiscipline for ourselvesfor certain bad instincts certain

christian instincts still lurk in our bodiesthat is to say the keen

eye for reality the cautious hand patience and seriousness in the

smallest things the whole integrity of knowledgeall these things

were already there and had been there for two thousand years more

there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste not as mere

braindrilling not as german culture with its loutish manners but

as body as bearing as instinctin short as reality all gone for

naught overnight it became merely a memorythe greeks the romans 

instinctive nobility taste methodical inquiry genius for organization

and administration faith in and the will to secure the future of man

a great yes to everything entering into the imperium romanum and

palpable to all the senses a grand style that was beyond mere art but

had become reality truth lifeall overwhelmed in a night but

not by a convulsion of nature not trampled to death by teutons and

others of heavy hoof but brought to shame by crafty sneaking

invisible anmic vampires not conqueredonly sucked dry hidden

vengefulness petty envy became master everything wretched

intrinsically ailing and invaded by bad feelings the whole

ghettoworld of the soul was at once on topone needs but read

any of the christian agitators for example st augustine in order to

realize in order to smell what filthy fellows came to the top it

would be an error however to assume that there was any lack of

understanding in the leaders of the christian movementah but they

were clever clever to the point of holiness these fathers of the

church what they lacked was something quite different nature

neglectedperhaps forgotto give them even the most  modest endowment

of respectable of upright of cleanly instincts between

ourselves they are not even men if islam despises christianity it

has a thousandfold right to do so islam at least assumes that it is

dealing with men
60
christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization

and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of mohammedan

civilization the wonderful culture of the moors in spain which was

fundamentally nearer to us and appealed more to our senses and tastes

than that of rome and greece was trampled down i do not say by

what sort of feet why because it had to thank noble and manly

instincts for its originbecause it said yes to life even to the rare

and refined luxuriousness of moorish life the crusaders later made

war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them

to have grovelled in the dusta civilization beside which even that of

our nineteenth century seems very poor and very senilewhat they

wanted of course was booty the orient was rich let us put  aside

our prejudices the crusades were a higher form of piracy nothing more

the german nobility which is fundamentally a viking nobility was in

its element there the church knew only too well how the german nobility

was to be won the german noble always the swiss guard of the

church always in the service of every bad instinct of the churchbut

well paid consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of german

swords and german blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry

through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth at this

point a host of painful questions suggest themselves the german

nobility stands outside the history of the higher civilization the

reason is obvious christianity alcoholthe two great means of

corruption intrinsically there should be no more choice between

islam and christianity than there is between an arab and a jew the

decision is already reached nobody remains at liberty to choose here

either a man is a chandala or he is not war to the knife with rome

peace and friendship with islam this was the feeling this was the

act of that great free spirit that genius among german emperors

frederick  ii what must a german first be a genius a free spirit

before he can feel decently i cant make out how a german could ever

feel christian
61
here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred

times more painful to germans the germans have destroyed for europe the

last great harvest of civilization that europe was ever to reapthe

renaissance is it understood at last will it ever be understood

what the renaissance was the transvaluation of christian

valuesan attempt with all available means all instincts and all the

resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the opposite values

the more noble values this has been the one great war of the past

there has never been a more critical question than that of the

renaissanceit is my question too there has never been a form of

attack more fundamental more direct or more violently delivered by a

whole front upon the center of the enemy to attack at the critical

place at the very seat of christianity and there enthrone the more

noble valuesthat is to say to insinuate them into the  instincts

into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there

i see before me the possibility of a perfectly heavenly enchantment

and spectacleit seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of

a fine and delicate beauty and within it there is an art so divine so

infernally divine that one might search in vain for thousands of years

for another such possibility i see a spectacle so rich in significance

and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should

arouse all the gods on olympus to immortal laughtercsar borgia as

pope am i understood well then that would have been the

sort of triumph that i alone am longing for today by it

christianity would have been swept awaywhat

happened a german monk luther came to rome this monk with all the

vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him raised a rebellion

against the renaissance in rome instead of grasping with profound

thanksgiving the miracle that had taken place the conquest of

christianity at its capitalinstead of this his hatred was

stimulated by the spectacle a religious man thinks only of

himselfluther saw only the depravity of the papacy at the very

moment when the oppo site was becoming apparent the old corruption the

peccatum originale christianity itself no longer occupied the papal

chair instead there was life instead there was the triumph of life

instead there was a great yea to all lofty beautiful and daring

things and luther restored the church he attacked it the

renaissancean event without meaning a great futilityah these

germans what they have not cost us futilitythat has always been

the work of the germansthe reformation leibnitz kant

and socalled german philosophy the war of liberation the

empireevery time a futile substitute for something that once existed

for something irrecoverable these germans i confess are my

enemies i despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation

their cowardice before every honest yea and nay for nearly a thousand

years they have tangled and confused everything their fingers have

touched they have on their conscience all the halfway measures all

the threeeighthsway measures that europe is sick ofthey also have

on their conscience the uncleanest variety of christianity that exists

and the most incurable and indestructibleprotestantism if man kind

never manages to get rid of christianity the germans will be to

blame
62
with this i come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment i

condemn christianity i bring against the christian church the most

terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his

mouth it is to me the greatest of all imaginable corruptions it

seeks to work the ultimate corruption the worst possible corruption

the christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity it has

turned every value into worthlessness and every truth into a lie and

every integrity into baseness of soul let any one dare to speak to me

of its humanitarian blessings its deepest necessities range it

against any effort to abolish distress it lives by distress it

creates distress to make itself immortal for example the worm

of sin it was the church that first enriched mankind with this

miserythe equality of souls before godthis fraud this pretext

for the rancunes of all the basemindedthis explosive concept

ending in revolution the modern idea and the notion of overthrowing

the whole social order this is christian dynamite the

humanitarian blessings of christianity forsooth to breed out of

humanitas a selfcontradiction an art of selfpollution a will to

lie at any price an aversion and contempt for all good and honest

instincts all this to me is the humanitarianism of

christianityparasitism as the only practice of the church with its

anmic and holy ideals sucking all the blood all the love all the

hope out of life the beyond as the will to deny all reality the cross

as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever

heard ofagainst health beauty wellbeing intellect kindness of

soulagainst life itself
this eternal accusation against christianity i shall write upon all

walls wherever walls are to be foundi have letters that even the

blind will be able to see i call christianity the one great curse

the one great intrinsic depravity the one great instinct of revenge

for which no means are venomous enough or secret subterranean and

small enoughi call it the one immortal blemish upon the human

race
and mankind reckons time from the dies nefastus when this fatality

befellfrom the first  day of christianitywhy not rather from its

lastfrom todaythe transvaluation of all values
the end

preface
1
it is often enough and always with great surprise intimated to me that

there is something both ordinary and unusual in all my writings from

the birth of tragedy to the recently published prelude to a

philosophy of the future they all contain i have been told snares

and nets for short sighted birds and something that is almost a

constant subtle incitement to an overturning of habitual opinions and

of approved customs what everything is merelyhumanall too human

with this exclamation my writings are gone through not without a

certain dread and mistrust of ethic itself and not without a disposition

to ask the exponent of evil things if those things be not simply

misrepresented my writings have been termed a school of distrust still

more of disdain also and more happily of courage audacity even and

in fact i myself do not believe that anybody ever looked into the world

with a distrust as deep as mine seeming as i do not simply the timely

advocate of the devil but to employ theological terms an enemy and

challenger of god and whosoever has experienced any of the consequences

of such deep distrust anything of the chills6 and the agonies of

isolation to which such an unqualified difference of standpoint condemns

him endowed with it will also understand how often i must have sought

relief and selfforgetfulness from any sourcethrough any object of

veneration or enmity of scientific seriousness or wanton lightness

also why i when i could not find what i was in need of had to fashion

it for myself counterfeiting it or imagining it and what poet or

writer has ever done anything else and what other purpose can all the

art in the world possibly have that which i always stood most in need

of in order to effect my cure and selfrecovery was faith faith enough

not to be thus isolated not to look at life from so singular a point of

viewa magic apprehension in eye and mind of relationship and

equality a calm confidence in friendship a blindness free from

suspicion and questioning to two sidedness a pleasure in externals

superficialities the near the accessible in all things possessed of

color skin and seeming perhaps i could be fairly reproached with much

art in this regard many fine counterfeitings for example that

wisely or wilfully i had shut my eyes to schopenhauers blind will

towards ethic at a time when i was already clear sighted enough on the

subject of ethic likewise that i had deceived myself concerning richard

wagners incurable romanticism7 as if it were a beginning and not an

end likewise concerning the greeks likewise concerning the germans and

their futureand there may be perhaps a long list of such likewises

granted however that all this were true and with justice urged

against me what does it signify what can it signify in regard to how

much of the selfsustaining capacity how much of reason and higher

protection are embraced in such selfdeceptionand how much more

falsity is still necessary to me that i may therewith always reassure

myself regarding the luxury of my truth enough i still live and life

is not considered now apart from ethic it will have deception it

thrives lebt on deception  but am i not beginning to do all over

again what i have always done i the old immoralist and bird

snarertalk unmorally ultramorally beyond good and evil
2
thus then have i evolved for myself the free spirits to whom this

discouragingencouraging work under the general title human all too

human is dedicated such free spirits do not really exist and never

did exist but i stood in need of them as i have pointed out in order

that some good might be mixed with my8 evils illness loneliness

strangeness acedia incapacity to serve as gay spirits and

comrades with whom one may talk and laugh when one is disposed to talk

and laugh and whom one may send to the devil when they grow wearisome

they are some compensation for the lack of friends that such free

spirits can possibly exist that our europe will yet number among her

sons of tomorrow or of the day after tomorrow such a brilliant and

enthusiastic company alive and palpable and not merely as in my case

fantasms and imaginary shades i myself can by no means doubt i see

them already coming slowly slowly may it not be that i am doing a

little something to expedite their coming when i describe in advance the

influences under which i see them evolving and the ways along which they

travel

it may be conjectured that a soul in which the type of free spirit can

attain maturity and completeness had its decisive and deciding event in

the form of a great emancipation or unbinding and that prior to that

event it seemed only the more firmly and forever chained to its place

and pillar what binds strongest what cords seem almost unbreakable in

the case of mortals9 of a choice and lofty nature they will be those of

duty that reverence which in youth is most typical that timidity and

tenderness in the presence of the traditionally honored and the worthy

that gratitude to the soil from which we sprung for the hand that

guided us for the relic before which we were taught to praytheir

sublimest moments will themselves bind these souls most strongly the

great liberation comes suddenly to such prisoners like an earthquake

the young soul is all at once shaken torn apart cast forthit

comprehends not itself what is taking place an involuntary onward

impulse rules them with the mastery of command a will a wish are

developed to go forward anywhere at any price a strong dangerous

curiosity regarding an undiscovered world flames and flashes in all

their being better to die than live hereso sounds the tempting

voice and this here this at home constitutes all they have

hitherto loved a sudden dread and distrust of that which they loved a

flash of contempt for that which is called their duty a mutinous

wilful volcaniclike longing for a far away journey strange scenes and

people annihilation petrifaction a hatred surmounting love perhaps a

sacrilegious impulse and look backwards to where they so long prayed

and loved perhaps a flush of shame for what they did and at the same

time an exultation10 at having done it an inner intoxicating

delightful tremor in which is betrayed the sense of victorya victory

over what over whom a riddlelike victory fruitful in questioning and

well worth questioning but the first victory for allsuch things of

pain and ill belong to the history of the great liberation and it is at

the same time a malady that can destroy a man this first outbreak of

strength and will for selfdestination selfvaluation this will for

free will and how much illness is forced to the surface in the frantic

strivings and singularities with which the freedman the liberated seeks

henceforth to attest his mastery over things he roves fiercely around

with an unsatisfied longing and whatever objects he may encounter must

suffer from the perilous expectancy of his pride he tears to pieces

whatever attracts him with a sardonic laugh he overturns whatever he

finds veiled or protected by any reverential awe he would see what

these things look like when they are overturned it is wilfulness and

delight in the wilfulness of it if he now perhaps gives his approval

to that which has heretofore been in ill reputeif in curiosity and

experiment he penetrates stealthily to the most forbidden things in

the background during all his plunging and roamingfor he is as

restless and aimless in his course as if lost in a wildernessis the

interrogation11 mark of a curiosity growing ever more dangerous can we

not upset every standard and is good perhaps evil and god only an

invention and a subtlety of the devil is everything in the last

resort false and if we are dupes are we not on that very account

dupers also must we not be dupers also such reflections lead and

mislead him ever further on ever further away solitude that dread

goddess and mater saeva cupidinum encircles and besets him ever more

threatening more violent more heart breakingbut who today knows

what solitude is
4
from this morbid solitude from the deserts of such trial years the way

is yet far to that great overflowing certainty and healthiness which

cannot dispense even with sickness as a means and a grappling hook of

knowledge to that matured freedom of the spirit which is in an equal

degree self mastery and discipline of the heart and gives access to

the path of much and various reflectionto that inner comprehensiveness

and self satisfaction of overrichness which precludes all danger that

the spirit has gone astray even in its own path and is sitting

intoxicated in some corner or other to that overplus12 of plastic

healing imitative and restorative power which is the very sign of

vigorous health that overplus which confers upon the free spirit the

perilous prerogative of spending a life in experiment and of running

adventurous risks the pastmasterprivilege of the free spirit in the

interval there may be long years of convalescence years filled with

many hued painfullybewitching transformations dominated and led to the

goal by a tenacious will for health that is often emboldened to assume

the guise and the disguise of health there is a middle ground to this

which a man of such destiny can not subsequently recall without emotion

he basks in a special fine sun of his own with a feeling of birdlike

freedom birdlike visual power birdlike irrepressibleness a something

extraneous drittes in which curiosity and delicate disdain have

united a free spiritthis refreshing term is grateful in any mood

it almost sets one aglow one livesno longer in the bonds of love and

hate without a yes or no here or there indifferently best pleased to

evade to avoid to beat about neither advancing nor retreating one is

habituated to the bad like a person who all at once sees a fearful

hurlyburly beneath himand one was the counterpart of him who

bothers himself with things that do not concern him as a matter of fact

the free spirit is bothered13 with mere thingsand how many

thingswhich no longer concern him
5
a step further in recovery and the free spirit draws near to life

again slowly indeed almost refractorily almost distrustfully there

is again warmth and mellowness feeling and fellow feeling acquire

depth lambent airs stir all about him he almost feels it seems as if

now for the first time his eyes are open to things near he is in

amaze and sits hushed for where had he been these near and immediate

things how changed they seem to him he looks gratefully backgrateful

for his wandering his self exile and severity his lookings afar and

his bird flights in the cold heights how fortunate that he has not

like a sensitive dull home body remained always in the house and at

home he had been beside himself beyond a doubt now for the first

time he really sees himselfand what surprises in the process what

hitherto unfelt tremors yet what joy in the exhaustion the old

sickness the relapses of the convalescent how it delights him

suffering to sit still to exercise patience to lie in the sun who so

well as he appreciates the fact that there comes balmy weather even in

winter who delights more in the14 sunshine athwart the wall they are

the most appreciative creatures in the world and also the most humble

these convalescents and lizards crawling back towards life there are

some among them who can let no day slip past them without addressing

some song of praise to its retreating light and speaking seriously it

is a fundamental cure for all pessimism the cankerous vice as is well

known of all idealists and humbugs to become ill in the manner of

these free spirits to remain ill quite a while and then bit by bit grow

healthyi mean healthier it is wisdom worldly wisdom to administer

even health to oneself for a long time in small doses
6
about this time it becomes at last possible amid the flash lights of a

still unestablished still precarious health for the free the ever

freer spirit to begin to read the riddle of that great liberation a

riddle which has hitherto lingered obscure well worth questioning

almost impalpable in his memory if once he hardly dared to ask why so

apart so alone renouncing all i loved renouncing respect itself why

this coldness this suspicion this hate for ones very virtuesnow

he dares and asks it loudly already15 hearing the answer you had to

become master over yourself master of your own good qualities formerly

they were your masters but they should be merely your tools along with

other tools you had to acquire power over your aye and no and learn to

hold and withhold them in accordance with your higher aims you had to

grasp the perspective of every representation werthschtzungthe

dislocation distortion and the apparent end or teleology of the

horizon besides whatever else appertains to the perspective also the

element of demerit in its relation to opposing merit and the whole

intellectual cost of every affirmative every negative you had to find

out the inevitable error1 in every yes and in every no error as

inseparable from life life itself as conditioned by the perspective and

its inaccuracy1 above all you had to see with your own eyes where

the error1 is always greatest there namely where life is littlest

narrowest meanest least developed and yet cannot help looking upon

itself as the goal and standard of things and smugly and ignobly and

incessantly tearing to tatters all that is highest and greatest and

richest and putting the shreds into the form of questions from the

standpoint of its own well being you had to see with your own eyes 16the

problem of classification rangordnung regulation concerning rank and

station and how strength and sweep and reach of perspective wax upward

together you hadenough the free spirit knows henceforward which

you had it has obeyed and also what it now can do and what it now for

the first time dare

7
accordingly the free spirit works out for itself an answer to that

riddle of its liberation and concludes by generalizing upon its

experience in the following fashion what i went through everyone must

go through in whom any problem is germinated and strives to body itself

forth the inner power and inevitability of this problem will assert

themselves in due course as in the case of any unsuspected

pregnancylong before the spirit has seen this problem in its true

aspect and learned to call it by its right name our destiny exercises

its influence over us even when as yet we have not learned its nature

it is our future that lays down the law to our today granted that it

is the problem of classification2 of which we free spirits may say

this is our problem yet it is only now in the midday 17of our life

that we fully appreciate what preparations shifts trials ordeals

stages were essential to that problem before it could emerge to our

view and why we had to go through the various and contradictory

longings and satisfactions of body and soul as circumnavigators and

adventurers of that inner world called man as surveyors of that

higher and of that progression3 that is also called

mancrowding in everywhere almost without fear disdaining nothing

missing nothing testing everything sifting everything and eliminating

the chance impuritiesuntil at last we could say we free spirits

herea new problem here a long ladder on the rungs of which we

ourselves have rested and risen which we have actually been at times

to what stage in the development just outlined the present book belongs

or is assigned is something that will be hidden from no augur or

18psychologist for an instant but where are there psychologists today

in france certainly in russia perhaps certainly not in germany

grounds are not wanting to be sure upon which the germans of today

may adduce this fact to their credit unhappily for one who in this

matter is fashioned and mentored in an ungerman school this german

book which has found its readers in a wide circle of lands and

peoplesit has been some ten years on its roundsand which must make

its way by means of any musical art and tune that will captivate the

foreign ear as well as the nativethis book has been read most

indifferently in germany itself and little heeded there to what is that

due it requires too much i have been told it addresses itself to

men free from the press of petty obligations it demands fine and

trained perceptions it requires a surplus a surplus of time of the

lightness of heaven and of the heart of otium in the most unrestricted

sense mere good things that we germans of today have not got and

therefore cannot give after so graceful a retort my philosophy bids

me be silent and ask no more questions at times as the proverb says

one remains a philosopher only because one saysnothing

of the first and last things
1
chemistry of the notions and the feelingsphilosophical problems in

almost all their aspects present themselves in the same interrogative

formula now that they did two thousand years ago how can a thing

develop out of its antithesis for example the reasonable from the

nonreasonable the animate from the inanimate the logical from the

illogical altruism from egoism disinterestedness from greed truth

from error the metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear of

this difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of one

thing from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemed

highest and best due to the very nature and being of the

thinginitself the historical philosophy on the other hand which

can no longer be viewed apart from physical science the youngest of all

philosophical methods discovered experimentally and its results will

probably always be the same that there is no antithesis whatever

except in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysical

comprehension20 and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of such

contradiction according to its explanation there is strictly

speaking neither unselfish conduct nor a wholly disinterested point of

view both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems

almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest

observation all that we need and that could possibly be given us in the

present state of development of the sciences is a chemistry of the

moral religious aesthetic conceptions and feeling as well as of those

emotions which we experience in the affairs great and small of society

and civilization and which we are sensible of even in solitude but

what if this chemistry established the fact that even in its domain

the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most

despised ingredients would many feel disposed to continue such

investigations mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and

beginning must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the

opposite course
2
the traditional error of philosophersall philosophers make the common

mistake of taking contemporary man as their starting point and of

trying through an analysis of him to21 reach a conclusion man

involuntarily presents himself to them as an aeterna veritas as a

passive element in every hurlyburly as a fixed standard of things yet

everything uttered by the philosopher on the subject of man is in the

last resort nothing more than a piece of testimony concerning man

during a very limited period of time lack of the historical sense is

the traditional defect in all philosophers many innocently take man in

his most childish state as fashioned through the influence of certain

religious and even of certain political developments as the permanent

form under which man must be viewed they will not learn that man has

evolved4 that the intellectual faculty itself is an evolution

whereas some philosophers make the whole cosmos out of this intellectual

faculty but everything essential in human evolution took place aeons

ago long before the four thousand years or so of which we know

anything during these man may not have changed very much however the

philosopher ascribes instinct to contemporary man and assumes that

this is one of the unalterable facts regarding man himself and hence

affords a clue to the understanding of the universe in general the

whole teleology is so planned that man during the last four thousand

years shall be spoken of as a being existing 22from all eternity and

with reference to whom everything in the cosmos from its very inception

is naturally ordered yet everything evolved there are no eternal facts

as there are no absolute truths accordingly historical philosophising

is henceforth indispensable and with it honesty of judgment

appreciation of simple truthsit is the characteristic of an advanced

civilization to set a higher value upon little simple truths

ascertained by scientific method than upon the pleasing and magnificent

errors originating in metaphysical and sthetical epochs and peoples to

begin with the former are spoken of with contempt as if there could be

no question of comparison respecting them so rigid homely prosaic and

even discouraging is the aspect of the first while so beautiful

decorative intoxicating and perhaps beatific appear the last named

nevertheless the hardwon the certain the lasting and therefore the

fertile in new knowledge is the higher to hold fast to it is manly and

evinces courage directness endurance and not only individual men but

all mankind will by degrees be uplifted to this manliness when they are

finally habituated to the proper appreciation of tenable23 enduring

knowledge and have lost all faith in inspiration and in the miraculous

revelation of truth the reverers of forms indeed with their standards

of beauty and taste may have good reason to laugh when the appreciation

of little truths and the scientific spirit begin to prevail but that

will be only because their eyes are not yet opened to the charm of the

utmost simplicity of form or because men though reared in the rightly

appreciative spirit will still not be fully permeated by it so that

they continue unwittingly imitating ancient forms and that ill enough

as anybody does who no longer feels any interest in a thing formerly

the mind was not brought into play through the medium of exact thought

its serious business lay in the working out of forms and symbols that

has now changed any seriousness in symbolism is at present the

indication of a deficient education as our very acts become more

intellectual our tendencies more rational and our judgment for

example as to what seems reasonable is very different from what it was

a hundred years ago so the forms of our lives grow ever more

intellectual and to the old fashioned eye perhaps uglier but only

because it cannot see that the richness of inner rational beauty always

spreads and deepens and that the inner rational aspect of all things

should now be of more consequence24 to us than the most beautiful

externality and the most exquisite limning
4
astrology and the likeit is presumable that the objects of the

religious moral aesthetic and logical notions pertain simply to the

superficialities of things although man flatters himself with the

thought that here at least he is getting to the heart of the cosmos he

deceives himself because these things have power to make him so happy

and so wretched and so he evinces in this respect the same conceit

that characterises astrology astrology presupposes that the heavenly

bodies are regulated in their movements in harmony with the destiny of

mortals the moral man presupposes that that which concerns himself most

nearly must also be the heart and soul of things
5
misconception of dreamsin the dream mankind in epochs of crude

primitive civilization thought they were introduced to a second

substantial world here we have the source of all metaphysic without

the dream men would never have been incited to an analysis of the25

world even the distinction between soul and body is wholly due to the

primitive conception of the dream as also the hypothesis of the

embodied soul whence the development of all superstition and also

probably the belief in god the dead still live for they appear to

the living in dreams so reasoned mankind at one time and through many

thousands of years
6
the scientific spirit prevails only partially not whollythe

specialized minutest departments of science are dealt with purely

objectively but the general universal sciences considered as a great

basic unity posit the questiontruly a very living question to what

purpose what is the use because of this reference to utility they are

as a whole less impersonal than when looked at in their specialized

aspects now in the case of philosophy as forming the apex of the

scientific pyramid this question of the utility of knowledge is

necessarily brought very conspicuously forward so that every philosophy

has unconsciously the air of ascribing the highest utility to itself

it is for this reason that all philosophies contain such a great amount

of high flying metaphysic and such a shrinking from the seeming

insignificance of26 the deliverances of physical science for the

significance of knowledge in relation to life must be made to appear as

great as possible this constitutes the antagonism between the

specialties of science and philosophy the latter aims as art aims at

imparting to life and conduct the utmost depth and significance in the

former mere knowledge is sought and nothing elsewhatever else be

incidentally obtained heretofore there has never been a philosophical

system in which philosophy itself was not made the apologist of

knowledge in the abstract on this point at least each is optimistic

and insists that to knowledge the highest utility must be ascribed they

are all under the tyranny of logic which is from its very nature

optimism
7
the discordant element in sciencephilosophy severed itself from

science when it put the question what is that knowledge of the world

and of life through which mankind may be made happiest this happened

when the socratic school arose with the standpoint of happiness the

arteries of investigating science were compressed too tightly to permit

of any circulation of the bloodand are so compressed today27
8
pneumatic explanation of nature5metaphysic reads the message of

nature as if it were written purely pneumatically as the church and its

learned ones formerly did where the bible was concerned it requires a

great deal of expertness to apply to nature the same strict science of

interpretation that the philologists have devised for all literature

and to apply it for the purpose of a simple direct interpretation of

the message and at the same time not bring out a double meaning but

as in the case of books and literature errors of exposition are far

from being completely eliminated and vestiges of allegorical and

mystical interpretations are still to be met with in the most cultivated

circles so where nature is concerned the case isactually much worse
5 pneumatic is here used in the sense of spiritual pneuma

being the greek word in the new testament for the holy spirited
9
metaphysical worldit is true there may be a metaphysical world the

absolute possibility of it can scarcely be disputed we see all things

through the medium of the human head and we cannot well cut off this

head although there 28remains the question what part of the world would

be left after it had been cut off but that is a purely abstract

scientific problem and one not much calculated to give men uneasiness

yet everything that has heretofore made metaphysical assumptions

valuable fearful or delightful to men all that gave rise to them is

passion error and self deception the worst systems of knowledge not

the best pin their tenets of belief thereto when such methods are once

brought to view as the basis of all existing religions and metaphysics

they are already discredited there always remains however the

possibility already conceded but nothing at all can be made out of

that to say not a word about letting happiness salvation and life hang

upon the threads spun from such a possibility accordingly nothing

could be predicated of the metaphysical world beyond the fact that it is

an elsewhere6 another sphere inaccessible and incomprehensible to

us it would become a thing of negative properties even were the

existence of such a world absolutely established it would nevertheless

remain incontrovertible that of all kinds of knowledge knowledge of

such a world would be of least consequenceof even less consequence

than knowledge of the chemical analysis of water would be to a storm

tossed mariner

the harmlessness of metaphysic in the futureas soon as religion art

and ethics are so understood that a full comprehension of them can be

gained without taking refuge in the postulates of metaphysical claptrap

at any point in the line of reasoning there will be a complete

cessation of interest in the purely theoretical problem of the thing in

itself and the phenomenon for here too the same truth applies in

religion art and ethics we are not concerned with the essence of the

cosmos7 we are in the sphere of pure conception no presentiment or

intuition can carry us any further with perfect tranquility the

question of how our conception of the world could differ so sharply from

the actual world as it is manifest to us will be relegated to the

physiological sciences and to the history of the evolution of ideas and

organisms

11
language as a presumptive sciencethe importance of language in the

development of civilization consists in the fact that by means of 30it

man placed one world his own alongside another a place of leverage

that he thought so firm as to admit of his turning the rest of the

cosmos on a pivot that he might master it in so far as man for ages

looked upon mere ideas and names of things as upon aeternae veritates

he evinced the very pride with which he raised himself above the brute

he really supposed that in language he possessed a knowledge of the

cosmos the language builder was not so modest as to believe that he was

only giving names to things on the contrary he thought he embodied the

highest wisdom concerning things in mere words and in truth

language is the first movement in all strivings for wisdom here too

it is faith in ascertained truth8 from which the mightiest fountains

of strength have flowed very tardilyonly nowit dawns upon men that

they have propagated a monstrous error in their belief in language

fortunately it is too late now to arrest and turn back the evolutionary

process of the reason which had its inception in this belief logic

itself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in the world of reality

corresponds for example the correspondence of certain things to one

another and the identity of those things at different periods of time

are assumptions pure 31and simple but the science of logic originated in

the positive belief that they were not assumptions at all but

established facts it is the same with the science of mathematics which

certainly would never have come into existence if mankind had known from

the beginning that in all nature there is no perfectly straight line no

true circle no standard of measurement
8 glaube an die gefundene wahrheit as distinguished from

faith in what is taken on trust as truth
12
dream and civilizationthe function of the brain which is most

encroached upon in slumber is the memory not that it is wholly

suspended but it is reduced to a state of imperfection as in primitive

ages of mankind was probably the case with everyone whether waking or

sleeping uncontrolled and entangled as it is it perpetually confuses

things as a result of the most trifling similarities yet in the same

mental confusion and lack of control the nations invented their

mythologies while nowadays travelers habitually observe how prone the

savage is to forgetfulness how his mind after the least exertion of

memory begins to wander and lose itself until finally he utters

falsehood and nonsense from sheer exhaustion yet in dreams we all

resemble this savage inadequacy of distinction and error of comparison

are the basis of32 the preposterous things we do and say in dreams so

that when we clearly recall a dream we are startled that so much idiocy

lurks within us the absolute distinctness of all dreamimages due to

implicit faith in their substantial reality recalls the conditions in

which earlier mankind were placed for whom hallucinations had

extraordinary vividness entire communities and even entire nations

laboring simultaneously under them therefore in sleep and in dream we

make the pilgrimage of early mankind over again
13
logic of the dreamduring sleep the nervous system through various

inner provocatives is in constant agitation almost all the organs act

independently and vigorously the blood circulates rapidly the posture

of the sleeper compresses some portions of the body the coverlets

influence the sensations in different ways the stomach carries on the

digestive process and acts upon other organs thereby the intestines are

in motion the position of the head induces unaccustomed action the

feet shoeless no longer pressing the ground are the occasion of other

sensations of novelty as is indeed the changed garb of the entire

body all these things following the bustle and change of the33 day

result through their novelty in a movement throughout the entire

system that extends even to the brain functions thus there are a

hundred circumstances to induce perplexity in the mind a questioning as

to the cause of this excitation now the dream is a seeking and

presenting of reasons for these excitations of feeling of the supposed

reasons that is to say thus for example whoever has his feet bound

with two threads will probably dream that a pair of serpents are coiled

about his feet this is at first a hypothesis then a belief with an

accompanying imaginative picture and the argument these snakes must be

the causa of those sensations which i the sleeper now have so

reasons the mind of the sleeper the conditions precedent as thus

conjectured become owing to the excitation of the fancy present

realities everyone knows from experience how a dreamer will transform

one piercing sound for example that of a bell into another of quite a

different nature say the report of cannon in his dream he becomes

aware first of the effects which he explains by a subsequent hypothesis

and becomes persuaded of the purely conjectural nature of the sound but

how comes it that the mind of the dreamer goes so far astray when the

same mind awake is habitually cautious careful and so conservative

in its dealings with hypotheses why34 does the first plausible

hypothesis of the cause of a sensation gain credit in the dreaming

state for in a dream we look upon that dream as reality that is we

accept our hypotheses as fully established i have no doubt that as men

argue in their dreams today mankind argued even in their waking

moments for thousands of years the first causa that occurred to the

mind with reference to anything that stood in need of explanation was

accepted as the true explanation and served as such savages show the

same tendency in operation as the reports of travelers agree in the

dream this atavistic relic of humanity manifests its existence within

us for it is the foundation upon which the higher rational faculty

developed itself and still develops itself in every individual dreams

carry us back to the earlier stages of human culture and afford us a

means of understanding it more clearly dream thought comes so easily to

us now because we are so thoroughly trained to it through the

interminable stages of evolution during which this fanciful and facile

form of theorising has prevailed to a certain extent the dream is a

restorative for the brain which during the day is called upon to meet

the many demands for trained thought made upon it by the conditions of a

higher civilizationwe may if we please become sensible even in our

waking moments35 of a condition that is as a door and vestibule to

dreaming if we close our eyes the brain immediately conjures up a

medley of impressions of light and color apparently a sort of imitation

and echo of the impressions forced in upon the brain during its waking

moments and now the mind in cooperation with the imagination

transforms this formless play of light and color into definite figures

moving groups landscapes what really takes place is a sort of

reasoning from effect back to cause as the brain inquires whence these

impressions of light and color it posits as the inducing causes of such

lights and colors those shapes and figures they serve the brain as the

occasions of those lights and colors because the brain when the eyes

are open and the senses awake is accustomed to perceiving the cause of

every impression of light and color made upon it here again the

imagination is continually interposing its images inasmuch as it

participates in the production of the impressions made through the

senses day by day and the dreamfancy does exactly the same thingthat

is the presumed cause is determined from the effect and after the

effect all this too with extraordinary rapidity so that in this

matter as in a matter of jugglery or sleightofhand a confusion of

the mind is produced and an after effect is made to appear a

simultaneous action an36 inverted succession of events evenfrom

these considerations we can see how late strict logical thought the

true notion of cause and effect must have been in developing since our

intellectual and rational faculties to this very day revert to these

primitive processes of deduction while practically half our lifetime is

spent in the superinducing conditionseven the poet the artist

ascribes to his sentimental and emotional states causes which are not

the true ones to that extent he is a reminder of early mankind and can

aid us in its comprehension
14
association9all strong feelings are associated with a variety of

allied sentiments and emotions they stir up the memory at the same

time when we are under their influence we are reminded of similar

states and we feel a renewal of them within us thus are formed habitual

successions of feelings and notions which at last when they follow

one another with lightning rapidity are no longer felt as complexities

but as unities in this sense we hear of moral feelings of religious

feelings as if they were absolute unities in reality they are streams

with a hundred sources and tributaries here again 37the unity of the

word speaks nothing for the unity of the thing

notions above and below to limitless space where they are destitute of

meaning so the philosophers do generally with the idea within and

without as regards the form and substance wesen und erscheinung of

the world what they claim is that through the medium of profound

feelings one can penetrate deep into the soul of things innre draw

close to the heart of nature but these feelings are deep only in so far

as with them are simultaneously aroused although almost imperceptibly

certain complicated groups of thoughts gedankengruppen which we call

deep a feeling is deep because we deem the thoughts accompanying it

deep but deep thought can nevertheless be very widely sundered from

truth as for instance every metaphysical thought take from deep

feeling the element of thought blended with it and all that remains is

strength of feeling 38which is no voucher for the validity of

knowledge as intense faith is evidence only of its own intensity and

not of the truth of that in which the faith is felt

phenomenon and thinginitselfthe philosophers are in the habit of

placing themselves in front of life and experiencethat which they call

the world of phenomenaas if they were standing before a picture that

is unrolled before them in its final completeness this panorama they

think must be studied in every detail in order to reach some conclusion

regarding the object represented by the picture from effect

accordingly is deduced cause and from cause is deduced the

unconditioned this process is generally looked upon as affording the

all sufficient explanation of the world of phenomena on the other hand

one must while putting the conception of the metaphysical distinctly

forward as that of the unconditioned and consequently of the

unconditioning absolutely deny any connection between the unconditioned

of the metaphysical world and the world known to us so that

throughout phenomena there is no manifestation of the thinginitself

and getting from one to the other is out of the question thus is left

quite ignored the circumstance that the picturethat39 which we now call

life and experienceis a gradual evolution is indeed still in

process of evolution and for that reason should not be regarded as an

enduring whole from which any conclusion as to its author the

allsufficient reason could be arrived at or even pronounced out of

the question it is because we have for thousands of years looked into

the world with moral aesthetic religious predispositions with blind

prejudice passion or fear and surfeited ourselves with indulgence in

the follies of illogical thought that the world has gradually become so

wondrously motley frightful significant soulful it has taken on

tints but we have been the colorists the human intellect upon the

foundation of human needs of human passions has reared all these

phenomena and injected its own erroneous fundamental conceptions into

things late very late the human intellect checks itself and now the

world of experience and the thinginitself seem to it so severed and so

antithetical that it denies the possibility of ones hinging upon the

otheror else summons us to surrender our intellect our personal will

to the secret and the aweinspiring in order that thereby we may attain

certainty of certainty hereafter again there are those who have

combined all the characteristic features of our world of

phenomenathat40 is the conception of the world which has been formed

and inherited through a series of intellectual vagariesand instead of

holding the intellect responsible for it all have pronounced the very

nature of things accountable for the present very sinister aspect of the

world and preached annihilation of existence through all these views

and opinions the toilsome steady process of science which now for the

first time begins to celebrate its greatest triumph in the genesis of

thought will definitely work itself out the result being perhaps to

the following effect that which we now call the world is the result of

a crowd of errors and fancies which gradually developed in the general

evolution of organic nature have grown together and been transmitted to

us as the accumulated treasure of all the pastas the treasure for

whatever is worth anything in our humanity rests upon it from this

world of conception it is in the power of science to release us only to

a slight extentand this is all that could be wishedinasmuch as it

cannot eradicate the influence of hereditary habits of feeling but it

can light up by degrees the stages of the development of that world of

conception and lift us at least for a time above the whole spectacle

perhaps we may then perceive that the thinginitself is a meet subject

for homeric laughter that it seemed so much everything41 indeed and

is really a voidvoid that is to say of meaning

metaphysical explanationman when he is young prizes metaphysical

explanations because they make him see matters of the highest import in

things he found disagreeable or contemptible and if he is not satisfied

with himself this feeling of dissatisfaction is soothed when he sees

the most hidden worldproblem or worldpain in that which he finds so

displeasing in himself to feel himself more unresponsible and at the

same time to find things dinge more interestingthat is to him the

double benefit he owes to metaphysics later indeed he acquires

distrust of the whole metaphysical method of explaining things he then

perceives perhaps that those effects could have been attained just as

well and more scientifically by another method that physical and

historical explanations would at least have given that feeling of

freedom from personal responsibility just as well while interest in

life and its problems would be stimulated perhaps even more
18
the fundamental problems of metaphysicsif a history of the

development of thought42 is ever written the following proposition

advanced by a distinguished logician will be illuminated with a new

light the universal primordial law of the apprehending subject

consists in the inner necessity of cognizing every object by itself as

in its essence a thing unto itself therefore as selfexisting and

unchanging in short as a substance even this law which is here

called primordial is an evolution it has yet to be shown how

gradually this evolution takes place in lower organizations how the

dim mole eyes of such organizations see at first nothing but a blank

sameness how later when the various excitations of desire and aversion

manifest themselves various substances are gradually distinguished but

each with an attribute that is a special relationship to such an

organization the first step towards the logical is judgment the

essence of which according to the best logicians is belief at the

foundation of all beliefs lie sensations of pleasure or pain in relation

to the apprehending subject a third feeling as the result of two

prior single separate feelings is judgment in its crudest form we

organic beings are primordially interested by nothing whatever in any

thing ding except its relation to ourselves with reference to pleasure

and pain between the moments in which we are conscious of this

relation the43 states of feeling lie the moments of rest of

notfeeling then the world and every thing ding have no interest for

us we observe no change in them as at present a person absorbed in

something does not notice anyone passing by to plants all things are

as a rule at rest eternal every object like itself from the period

of lower organisms has been handed down to man the belief that there are

like things gleiche dinge only the trained experience attained

through the most advanced science contradicts this postulate the

primordial belief of all organisms is perhaps that all the rest of the

world is one thing and motionlessfurthest away from this first step

towards the logical is the notion of causation even today we think

that all our feelings and doings are at bottom acts of the free will

when the sentient individual contemplates himself he deems every

feeling every change a something isolated disconnected that is to

say unqualified by any thing it comes suddenly to the surface

independent of anything that went before or came after we are hungry

but originally we do not know that the organism must be nourished on

the contrary that feeling seems to manifest itself without reason or

purpose it stands out by itself and seems quite independent therefore

the belief in the freedom of the will is a primordial error of

everything organic44 as old as the very earliest inward prompting of the

logical faculty belief in unconditioned substances and in like things

gleiche dinge is also a primordial and equally ancient error of

everything organic inasmuch as all metaphysic has concerned itself

particularly with substance and with freedom of the will it should be

designated as the science that deals with the fundamental errors of

mankind as if they were fundamental truths
19
numberthe invention of the laws of number has as its basis the

primordial and priorprevailing delusion that many like things exist

although in point of fact there is no such thing is a duplicate or

that at least there are things but there is no thing the

assumption of plurality always presupposes that something exists which

manifests itself repeatedly but just here is where the delusion

prevails in this very matter we feign realities unities that have no

existence our feelings notions of space and time are false for they

lead when duly tested to logical contradictions in all scientific

demonstrations we always unavoidably base our calculation upon some

false standards of duration or measurement but as these standards45 are

at least constant as for example our notions of time and space the

results arrived at by science possess absolute accuracy and certainty in

their relationship to one another one can keep on building upon

themuntil is reached that final limit at which the erroneous

fundamental conceptions the invariable breakdown come into conflict

with the results establishedas for example in the case of the atomic

theory here we always find ourselves obliged to give credence to a

thing or material substratum that is set in motion although at the

same time the whole scientific programme has had as its aim the

resolving of everything material into motions themselves here again

we distinguish with our feeling that which does the moving and that

which is moved11 and we never get out of this circle because the

belief in things12 has been from time immemorial rooted in our

naturewhen kant says the intellect does not derive its laws from

nature but dictates them to her he states the full truth as regards

the idea of nature which we form nature  world as notion that is

as error but which is merely the synthesis of a host of errors of the

intellect 46to a world not the outcome of our conception the laws of

number are wholly inapplicable such laws are valid only in the world of

mankind

some backward stepsone very forward step in education is taken when

man emerges from his superstitious and religious ideas and fears and

for instance no longer believes in the dear little angels or in

original sin and has stopped talking about the salvation of the soul

when he has taken this step to freedom he has nevertheless through the

utmost exertion of his mental power to overcome metaphysics then a

backward movement is necessary he must appreciate the historical

justification and to an equal extent the psychological considerations

in such a movement he must understand that the greatest advances made

by mankind have resulted from such a course and that without this very

backward movement the highest achievements of man hitherto would have

been impossiblewith regard to philosophical metaphysics i see ever

more and more who have arrived at the negative goal that all positive

metaphysic is a delusion but as yet very few who go a few steps

backward one should look out over the last rungs of the ladder but not

try to stand on47 them that is to say the most advanced as yet go only

far enough to free themselves from metaphysic and look back at it with

an air of superiority whereas here no less than in the hippodrome it

is necessary to turn around in order to reach the end of the course
21
presumable nature of the victory of doubtlet us assume for a moment

the validity of the skeptical standpoint granted that there is no

metaphysical world and that all the metaphysical explanations of the

only world we know are useless to us how would we then contemplate men

and things menschen und dinge this can be thought out and it is

worth while doing so even if the question whether anything metaphysical

has ever been demonstrated by or through kant and schopenhauer be put

altogether aside for it is to all appearances highly probable that

men on this point will be in the mass skeptical the question thus

becomes what sort of a notion will human society under the influence

of such a state of mind form of itself perhaps the scientific

demonstration of any metaphysical world is now so difficult that

mankind will never be free from a distrust of it and when there is

formed a feeling of distrust48 of metaphysics the results are in the

mass the same as if metaphysics were refuted altogether and could no

longer be believed in both cases the historical question with regard

to an unmetaphysical disposition in mankind remains the same
22
disbelief in the monumentum aere perennius13a decided

disadvantage attending the termination of metaphysical modes of

thought is that the individual fixes his mind too attentively upon his

own brief lifetime and feels no strong inducement to aid in the

foundation of institutions capable of enduring for centuries he wishes

himself to gather the fruit from the tree that he plants and

consequently he no longer plants those trees which require centuries of

constant cultivation and are destined to afford shade to generation

after generation in the future for metaphysical views inspire the

belief that in them is afforded the final sure foundation upon which

henceforth the whole future of mankind may rest and be built up the

individual promotes his own salvation when 49for example he builds a

church or a monastery he is of opinion that he is doing something for

the salvation of his immortal soulcan science as well inspire such

faith in the efficacy of her results in actual fact science requires

doubt and distrust as her surest auxiliaries nevertheless the sum of

the irresistible that is all the onslaughts of skepticism all the

disintegrating effects of surviving truths can easily become so great

as for instance in the case of hygienic science as to inspire the

determination to build eternal works upon it at present the contrast

between our excitated ephemeral existence and the tranquil repose of

metaphysical epochs is too great because both are as yet in too close

juxtaposition the individual man himself now goes through too many

stages of inner and outer evolution for him to venture to make a plan

even for his life time alone a perfectly modern man indeed who wants

to build himself a house feels as if he were walling himself up alive in

a mausoleum

age of comparisonthe less men are bound by tradition the greater is

the inner activity of motives the greater correspondingly the outer

restlessness the promiscuous flow of humanity the polyphony of

strivings who now feels any50 great impulse to establish himself and his

posterity in a particular place for whom moreover does there exist

at present any strong tie as all the methods of the arts were copied

from one another so were all the methods and advancements of moral

codes of manners of civilizationssuch an age derives its

significance from the fact that in it the various ideas codes manners

and civilizations can be compared and experienced side by side which

was impossible at an earlier period in view of the localised nature of

the rule of every civilization corresponding to the limitation of all

artistic effects by time and place today the growth of the aesthetic

feeling is decided owing to the great number of artistic forms which

offer themselves for comparison the majoritythose that are condemned

by the method of comparisonwill be allowed to die out in the same way

there is today taking place a selection of the forms and customs of the

higher morality which can result only in the extinction of the vulgar

moralities this is the age of comparison that is its glorybut also

its pain let us not however shrink from this pain rather would we

comprehend the nature of the task imposed upon us by our age as

adequately as we can posterity will bless us for doing soa posterity

that knows itself to be developed through and above the narrow51 early

racecivilizations as well as the culturecivilization of comparison

but yet looks gratefully back upon both as venerable monuments of

antiquity

possibility of progresswhen a master of the old civilization den

alten cultur vows to hold no more discussion with men who believe in

progress he is quite right for the old civilization14 has its

greatness and its advantages behind it and historic training forces one

to acknowledge that it can never again acquire vigor only intolerable

stupidity or equally intolerable fanaticism could fail to perceive this

fact but men may consciously determine to evolve to a new civilization

where formerly they evolved unconsciously and accidentally they can now

devise better conditions for the advancement of mankind for their

nourishment training and education they can administer the earth as an

economic power and particularly compare the capacities of men and

select them accordingly this new conscious civilization is killing the

other which on the whole has led but an unreflective 52animal and plant

life it is also destroying the doubt of progress itselfprogress is

possible i mean it is hasty and almost unreflective to assume that

progress must necessarily take place but how can it be doubted that

progress is possible on the other hand progress in the sense and along

the lines of the old civilization is not even conceivable if romantic

fantasy employs the word progress in connection with certain aims and

ends identical with those of the circumscribed primitive national

civilizations the picture presented of progress is always borrowed from

the past the idea and the image of progress thus formed are quite

without originality

private ethics and world ethicssince the extinction of the belief

that a god guides the general destiny of the world and notwithstanding

all the contortions and windings of the path of mankind leads it

gloriously forward men must shape oecumenical worldembracing ends for

themselves the older ethics namely kants required of the individual

such a course of conduct as he wishes all men to follow this evinces

much simplicityas if any individual could determine off hand what

course of conduct would conduce to the welfare of humanity and what

course of conduct is preminently desir53able this is a theory like that

of freedom of competition which takes it for granted that the general

harmony of things must prevail of itself in accordance with some

inherent law of betterment or amelioration it may be that a later

contemplation of the needs of mankind will reveal that it is by no means

desirable that all men should regulate their conduct according to the

same principle it may be best from the standpoint of certain ends yet

to be attained that men during long periods should regulate their

conduct with reference to special and even in certain circumstances

evil objects at any rate if mankind is not to be led astray by such a

universal rule of conduct it behooves it to attain a knowledge of the

condition of culture that will serve as a scientific standard of

comparison in connection with cosmical ends herein is comprised the

tremendous mission of the great spirits of the next century
26
reaction as progressoccasionally harsh powerful impetuous yet

nevertheless backward spirits appear who try to conjure back some past

era in the history of mankind they serve as evidence that the new

tendencies which they oppose are not yet potent enough that there54 is

something lacking in them otherwise they the tendencies would better

withstand the effects of this conjuring back process thus luthers

reformation shows that in his century all the impulses to freedom of the

spirit were still uncertain lacking in vigor and immature science

could not yet rear her head indeed the whole renaissance appears but as

an early spring smothered in snow but even in the present century

schopenhauers metaphysic shows that the scientific spirit is not yet

powerful enough for the whole mediaeval christian worldstandpoint

weltbetrachtung and conception of man menschempfindung15 once

again notwithstanding the slowly wrought destruction of all christian

dogma celebrated a resurrection in schopenhauers doctrine there is

much science in his teaching although the science does not dominate

but instead of it the old trite metaphysical necessity it is one

of the greatest and most priceless advantages of schopenhauers teaching

that by it our feelings are temporarily forced back to those old human

and cosmical standpoints to which no other path could conduct us so

easily the gain for history and justice is very great i believe that

without schopenhauers aid it would be no easy matter for 55anyone now to

do justice to christianity and its asiatic relativesa thing impossible

as regards the christianity that still survives after according this

respect the historical point of view which the age of learning brought

a substitute for religionit is supposed to be a recommendation for

philosophy to say of it that it provides the people with a substitute

for religion and in fact the training of the intellect does

necessitate the convenient laying out of the track of thought since the

transition from religion by way of science entails a powerful perilous

leapsomething that should be advised against with this

qualification the recommendation referred to is a just one at the same

time it should be further explained that the needs which religion

satisfies and which science must now satisfy are not immutable even

they can be diminished and uprooted think for instance of the

christian soulneed the sighs over56 ones inner corruption the anxiety

regarding salvationall notions that arise simply out of errors of the

reason and require no satisfaction at all but annihilation a

philosophy can either so affect these needs as to appease them or else

put them aside altogether for they are acquired circumscribed needs

based upon hypotheses which those of science explode here for the

purpose of affording the means of transition for the sake of lightening

the spirit overburdened with feeling art can be employed to far better

purpose as these hypotheses receive far less support from art than from

a metaphysical philosophy then from art it is easier to go over to a

really emancipating philosophical science
28
discredited wordsaway with the disgustingly overused words optimism

and pessimism for the occasion for using them grows daily less only

drivelers now find them indispensably necessary what earthly reason

could anyone have for being an optimist unless he had a god to defend

who must have created the best of all possible worlds since he is

himself all goodness and perfectionbut what thinking man has now any

need for the hypothesis that there is a godthere is also no occasion

whatever for57 a pessimistic confession of faith unless one has a

personal interest in denouncing the advocate of god the theologian or

the theological philosopher and maintaining the counter proposition

that evil reigns that wretchedness is more potent than joy that the

world is a piece of botch work that phenomenon erscheinung is but the

manifestation of some evil spirit but who bothers his head about the

theologians any moreexcept the theologians themselves apart from all

theology and its antagonism it is manifest that the world is neither

good nor bad to say nothing about its being the best or the worst and

that these ideas of good and bad have significance only in relation

to men indeed are without significance at all in view of the sense in

which they are usually employed the contemptuous and the eulogistic

point of view must in every case be repudiated

intoxicated by the perfume of flowersthe ship of humanity it is

feels the higher the standard he sets for himself the greater his

distance from the other animalsthe more he58 appears as a genius

genie among animalsthe nearer he gets to the true nature of the

world and to comprehension thereof this indeed he really does through

science but he thinks he does it far more adequately through his

religions and arts these are certainly a blossoming of the world but

not therefore nearer the roots of the world than is the stalk one

cannot learn best from it the nature of the world although nearly

everyone thinks so error has made men so deep sensitive and

imaginative in order to bring forth such flowers as religions and arts

pure apprehension would be unable to do that whoever should disclose to

us the essence of the world would be undeceiving us most cruelly not

the world as thinginitself but the world as idea16 as error is

rich in portent deep wonderful carrying happiness and unhappiness in

its womb this result leads to a philosophy of world negation which at

any rate can be as well combined with a practical world affirmation as

with its opposite

justification so also an opinion gives happiness therefore it is the

is predicated of the effect that it gives happiness that it is good in

the sense of utility and there is likewise predicated of the cause that

it is good but good in the sense of logical validity conversely the

proposition would run a thing17 cannot attain success cannot

maintain itself therefore it is evil a belief troubles the believer

occasions pain therefore it is false the free spirit who is sensible

of the defect in this method of reaching conclusions and has had to

suffer its consequences often succumbs to the temptation to come to the

very opposite conclusions which in general are of course equally

erroneous a thing cannot maintain itself therefore it is good a

belief is troublesome therefore it is true

the illogical is necessaryamong the things which can bring a thinker

to distraction is the knowledge that the illogical is necessary 60to

mankind and that from the illogical springs much that is good the

illogical is so imbedded in the passions in language in art in

religion and above all in everything that imparts value to life that

it cannot be taken away without irreparably injuring those beautiful

things only men of the utmost simplicity can believe that the nature

man knows can be changed into a purely logical nature yet were there

steps affording approach to this goal how utterly everything would be

lost on the way even the most rational man needs nature again from

time to time that is his illogical fundamental relation

grundstellung to all things
32
being unjust is essentialall judgments of the value of life are

illogically developed and therefore unjust the vice of the judgment

consists first in the way in which the subject matter comes under

observation that is very incompletely secondly in the way in which

the total is summed up and thirdly in the fact that each single item

in the totality of the subject matter is itself the result of defective

perception and this from absolute necessity no practical knowledge of

a man for example stood he never so near to us can be completeso

that61 we could have a logical right to form a total estimate of him all

estimates are summary and must be so then the standard by which we

measure our being is not an immutable quantity we have moods and

variations and yet we should know ourselves as an invariable standard

before we undertake to establish the nature of the relation of any thing

sache to ourselves perhaps it will follow from all this that one

should form no judgments whatever if one could but merely live

without having to form estimates without aversion and without

partialityfor everything most abhorred is closely connected with an

estimate as well as every strongest partiality an inclination towards

a thing or from a thing without an accompanying feeling that the

beneficial is desired and the pernicious contemned an inclination

without a sort of experiential estimation of the desirability of an end

does not exist in man we are primordially illogical and hence unjust

beings and can recognise this fact this is one of the greatest and

most baffling discords of existence
33
error respecting living for the sake of living essentialevery belief

in the value and worthiness of life rests upon defective thinking62 it

is for this reason alone possible that sympathy with the general life

and suffering of mankind is so imperfectly developed in the individual

even exceptional men who can think beyond their own personalities do

not have this general life in view but isolated portions of it if one

is capable of fixing his observation upon exceptional cases i mean upon

highly endowed individuals and pure souled beings if their development

is taken as the true end of worldevolution and if joy be felt in their

existence then it is possible to believe in the value of life because

in that case the rest of humanity is overlooked hence we have here

defective thinking so too it is even if all mankind be taken into

consideration and one species only of impulses the less egoistic

brought under review and those in consideration of the other impulses

exalted then something could still be hoped of mankind in the mass and

to that extent there could exist belief in the value of life here

again as a result of defective thinking whatever attitude thus one

may assume one is as a result of this attitude an exception among

mankind now the great majority of mankind endure life without any

great protest and believe to this extent in the value of existence

but that is because each individual decides and determines alone and

never comes out of his own personality63 like these exceptions

everything outside of the personal has no existence for them or at the

utmost is observed as but a faint shadow consequently the value of life

for the generality of mankind consists simply in the fact that the

individual attaches more importance to himself than he does to the

world the great lack of imagination from which he suffers is

responsible for his inability to enter into the feelings of beings other

than himself and hence his sympathy with their fate and suffering is of

the slightest possible description on the other hand whosoever really

could sympathise necessarily doubts the value of life were it

possible for him to sum up and to feel in himself the total

consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a malediction against

existencefor mankind is in the mass without a goal and hence man

cannot find in the contemplation of his whole course anything to serve

him as a mainstay and a comfort but rather a reason to despair if he

looks beyond the things that immediately engage him to the final

aimlessness of humanity his own conduct assumes in his eyes the

character of a frittering away to feel oneself however as humanity

not alone as an individual frittered away exactly as we see the stray

leaves frittered away by nature is a feeling transcending all feeling

but who is capable of it only64 a poet certainly and poets always know

how to console themselves
34
for tranquilitybut will not our philosophy become thus a tragedy

will not truth prove the enemy of life of betterment a question seems

to weigh upon our tongue and yet will not put itself into words whether

one can knowingly remain in the domain of the untruthful or if one

must whether then death would not be preferable for there is no

longer any ought sollen morality so far as it is involved ought

is through our point of view as utterly annihilated as religion our

knowledge can permit only pleasure and pain benefit and injury to

subsist as motives but how can these motives be distinguished from the

desire for truth even they rest upon error in so far as already

stated partiality and dislike and their very inaccurate estimates

palpably modify our pleasure and our pain the whole of human life is

deeply involved in untruth the individual cannot extricate it from

this pit without thereby fundamentally clashing with his whole past

without finding his present motives of conduct as that of honor

illegitimate and without opposing scorn and contempt to the ambitions65

which prompt one to have regard for the future and for ones happiness

in the future is it true does there then remain but one way of

thinking which as a personal consequence brings in its train despair

and as a theoretical consequence brings in its train a philosophy of

decay disintegration self annihilation i believe the deciding

influence as regards the aftereffect of knowledge will be the

temperament of a man i can in addition to this aftereffect just

mentioned suppose another by means of which a much simpler life and

one freer from disturbances than the present could be lived so that at

first the old motives of vehement passion might still have strength

owing to hereditary habit but they would gradually grow weaker under

the influence of purifying knowledge a man would live at last both

among men and unto himself as in the natural state without praise

reproach competition feasting ones eyes as if it were a play upon

much that formerly inspired dread one would be rid of the strenuous

element and would no longer feel the goad of the reflection that man is

not even as much as nature nor more than nature to be sure this

requires as already stated a good temperament a fortified gentle and

naturally cheerful soul a disposition that has no need to be on its

guard against its own eccentricities and sudden outbreaks66 and that in

its utterances manifests neither sullenness nor a snarling tonethose

familiar disagreeable characteristics of old dogs and old men that have

been a long time chained up rather must a man from whom the ordinary

bondages of life have fallen away to so great an extent so do that he

only lives on in order to grow continually in knowledge and to learn to

resign without envy and without disappointment much yes nearly

everything that has value in the eyes of men he must be content with

such a free fearless soaring above men manners laws and traditional

estimates of things as the most desirable of all situations he will

freely share the joy of being in such a situation and he has perhaps

nothing else to sharein which renunciation and selfdenial really most

consist but if more is asked of him he will with a benevolent shake

of the head refer to his brother the free man of fact and will

perhaps not dissemble a little contempt for as regards his freedom

thereby hangs a tale18

advantages of psychological observationthat reflection regarding the

human alltoohumanor as the learned jargon is psychological

observationis among the means whereby the burden of life can be made

lighter that practice in this art affords presence of mind in difficult

situations and entertainment amid a wearisome environment aye that

maxims may be culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of life

and invigoration thereby obtained this much was believed was knownin

former centuries why was this forgotten in our own century during

which at least in germany yes in europe poverty as regards

psychological observation would have been manifest in many ways had

there been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself not

only in the novel in the romance in philosophical standpointsthese

are the works of exceptional men still more in the state of opinion

regarding public events and personages above all in general society

which says much about men but68 nothing whatever about man there is

totally lacking the art of psychological analysis and synthesis but why

is the richest and most harmless source of entertainment thus allowed to

run to waste why is the greatest master of the psychological maxim no

longer readfor with no exaggeration whatever be it said the

educated person in europe who has read la rochefoucauld and his

intellectual and artistic affinities is very hard to find still harder

the person who knows them and does not disparage them apparently too

this unusual reader takes far less pleasure in them than the form

adopted by these artists should afford him for the subtlest mind cannot

adequately appreciate the art of maximmaking unless it has had training

in it unless it has competed in it without such practical

acquaintance one is apt to look upon this making and forming as a much

easier thing than it really is one is not keenly enough alive to the

felicity and the charm of success hence present day readers of maxims

have but a moderate tempered pleasure in them scarcely indeed a true

perception of their merit so that their experiences are about the same

as those of the average beholder of cameos people who praise because

they cannot appreciate and are very ready to admire and still readier

to turn away69
36
objectionor is there a counterproposition to the dictum that

psychological observation is one of the means of consoling lightening

charming existence have enough of the unpleasant effects of this art

been experienced to justify the person striving for culture in turning

his regard away from it in all truth a certain blind faith in the

goodness of human nature an implanted distaste for any disparagement of

human concerns a sort of shamefacedness at the nakedness of the soul

may be far more desirable things in the general happiness of a man than

this only occasionally advantageous quality of psychological

sharpsightedness and perhaps belief in the good in virtuous men and

actions in a plenitude of disinterested benevolence has been more

productive of good in the world of men in so far as it has made men less

distrustful if plutarchs heroes are enthusiastically imitated and a

reluctance is experienced to looking too critically into the motives of

their actions not the knowledge but the welfare of human society is

promoted thereby psychological error and above all obtuseness in regard

to it help human nature forward whereas knowledge of the truth is more

promoted by means of the stimulating strength of a hypothesis as la

rochefoucauld70 in the first edition of his sentences and moral maxims

has expressed it what the world calls virtue is ordinarily but a

phantom created by the passions and to which we give a good name in

order to do whatever we please with impunity la rochefoucauld and

those other french masters of soulsearching to the number of whom has

lately been added a german the author of psychological observations

are like expert marksmen who again and again hit the black spotbut it

is the black spot in human nature their art inspires amazement but

finally some spectator inspired not by the scientific spirit but by a

humanitarian feeling execrates an art that seems to implant in the soul

a taste for belittling and impeaching mankind
37
neverthelessthe matter therefore as regards pro and con stands

thus in the present state of philosophy an awakening of the moral

observation is essential the repulsive aspect of psychological

dissection with the knife and tweezers entailed by the process can no

longer be spared humanity such is the imperative duty of any science

that investigates the origin and history of the socalled moral feelings

and71 which in its progress is called upon to posit and to solve

advanced social problemsthe older philosophy does not recognize the

newer at all and through paltry evasions has always gone astray in the

investigation of the origin and history of human estimates

werthschtzungen with what results may now be very clearly perceived

since it has been shown by many examples how the errors of the greatest

philosophers have their origin in a false explanation of certain human

actions and feelings how upon the foundation of an erroneous analysis

for example of the so called disinterested actions a false ethic is

reared to support which religion and like mythological monstrosities

are called in until finally the shades of these troubled spirits

collapse in physics and in the comprehensive world point of view but if

it be established that superficiality of psychological observation has

heretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment and

deduction and will continue to do so all the greater need is there of

that steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone upon

stone little stone upon little stone all the greater need is there of

a courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that will oppose

persistence to all contempt it is finally also true that countless

single observations concerning the human alltoohuman72 have been

first made and uttered in circles accustomed not to furnish matter for

scientific knowledge but for intellectual pleasureseeking and the

original home atmospherea very seductive atmosphereof the moral

maxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated the entire species so

that the scientific man involuntarily manifests a sort of mistrust of

this species and of its seriousness but it is sufficient to point to

the consequences for already it is becoming evident that events of the

most portentous nature are developing in the domain of psychological

observation what is the leading conclusion arrived at by one of the

subtlest and calmest of thinkers the author of the work concerning the

origin of the moral feelings as a result of his thorough and incisive

analysis of human conduct the moral man he says stands no nearer

the knowable metaphysical world than the physical man19 this

dictum grown hard and cutting beneath the hammerblow of historical

knowledge can some day perhaps in some future or other serve as the

axe that will be laid to the root of the metaphysical necessities of

menwhether more to the blessing than to the banning of universal well

73being who can saybut in any event a dictum fraught with the most

momentous consequences fruitful and fearful at once and confronting

the world in the two faced way characteristic of all great facts
19 der moralische mensch sagt er steht der intelligiblen

metaphysischen welt nicht nher als der physische mensch
38
to what extent usefultherefore whether psychological observation is

more an advantage than a disadvantage to mankind may always remain

undetermined but there is no doubt that it is necessary because

science can no longer dispense with it science however recognizes no

considerations of ultimate goals or ends any more than nature does but

as the latter duly matures things of the highest fitness for certain

ends without any intention of doing it so will true science doing with

ideas what nature does with matter20 promote the purposes and the

welfare of humanity as occasion may afford and in many ways and

attain fitness to endsbut likewise without having intended it
20 als die nachahmung der natur in begriffen literally as

the counterfeit of nature in regard to ideas
he to whom the atmospheric conditions of such a prospect are too wintry

has too little fire in him let him look about him and he will 74become

sensible of maladies requiring an icy air and of people who are so

kneaded together out of ardor and intellect that they can scarcely

find anywhere an atmosphere too cold and cutting for them moreover as

too serious individuals and nations stand in need of trivial

relaxations as others too volatile and excitable require onerous

weighty ordeals to render them entirely healthy should not we the more

intellectual men of this age which is swept more and more by

conflagrations catch up every cooling and extinguishing appliance we

can find that we may always remain as self contained steady and calm as

we are now and thereby perhaps serve this age as its mirror and self

reflector when the occasion arises
39
the fable of discretionary freedomthe history of the feelings on the

basis of which we make everyone responsible hence the socalled moral

feelings is traceable in the following leading phases at first single

actions are termed good or bad without any reference to their motive

but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicial consequences they

have for the community in time however the origin of these

designations is forgotten but it is imagined75 that action in itself

without reference to its consequences contains the property good or

bad with the same error according to which language designates the

stone itself as hardness the tree itself as greennessfor the

reason therefore that what is a consequence is comprehended as a

cause accordingly the goodness or badness is incorporated into the

motive and any deed by itself is regarded as morally ambiguous a step

further is taken and the predication good or bad is no longer made of

the particular motives but of the entire nature of a man out of which

motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil thus man is

successively made responsible for his particular acts then for his

course of conduct then for his motives and finally for his nature

now at last is it discovered that this nature even cannot be

responsible inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessary consequence

and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of past and present

things therefore that man is to be made responsible for nothing

neither for his nature nor his motives nor his course of conduct nor

his particular acts by this process is gained the knowledge that

the history of moral estimates is the history of error of the error of

responsibility as is whatever rests upon the error of the freedom of

the will schopenhauer76 concluded just the other way thus since

certain actions bring depression consciousness of guilt in their

train there must then exist responsibility for there would be no

basis for this depression at hand if all mans affairs did not follow

their course of necessityas they do indeed according to the opinion

of this philosopher follow their coursebut man himself subject to

the same necessity would be just the man that he iswhich schopenhauer

denies from the fact of such depression schopenhauer believes himself

able to prove a freedom which man in some way must have had not indeed

in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature freedom

therefore to be thus and so not to act thus and so out of the esse

the sphere of freedom and responsibility follows according to his

opinion the operari the spheres of invariable causation necessity

and irresponsibility this depression indeed is due apparently to the

operariin so far as it be delusivebut in truth to whatever esse

be the deed of a free will the basic cause of the existence of an

individual in order to let man become whatever he wills to become

his to will wollen must precede his existencehere apart from the

absurdity of the statement just made there is drawn the wrong inference

that the fact of the depression explains its character the rational77

admissibility of it from such a wrong inference does schopenhauer first

come to his fantastic consequent of the so called discretionary freedom

intelligibeln freiheit for the origin of this fabulous entity plato

and kant are equally responsible but depression after the act does not

need to be rational indeed it is certainly not so at all for it rests

upon the erroneous assumption that the act need not necessarily have

come to pass therefore only because man deems himself free but not

because he is free does he experience remorse and the stings of

consciencemoreover this depression is something that can be grown

out of in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of acts

which inspire it in many other men it is a very varying thing and one

closely connected with the development of custom and civilization and

perhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the worlds

historyno one is responsible for his acts no one for his nature to

judge is tantamount to being unjust this applies as well when the

individual judges himself the proposition is as clear as sunlight and

yet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth for fear

of the consequences
40
above animalthe beast in us must be78 wheedled ethic is necessary

that we may not be torn to pieces without the errors involved in the

assumptions of ethics man would have remained an animal thus has he

taken himself as something higher and imposed rigid laws upon himself

he feels hatred consequently for states approximating the animal

whence the former contempt for the slave as a notyetman as a thing

is to be explained
41
unalterable characterthat character is unalterable is not in the

strict sense true rather is this favorite proposition valid only to

the extent that during the brief life period of a man the potent new

motives can not usually press down hard enough to obliterate the lines

imprinted by ages could we conceive of a man eighty thousand years old

we should have in him an absolutely alterable character so that the

maturities of successive varying individuals would develop in him the

shortness of human life leads to many erroneous assertions concerning

the qualities of man
42
classification of enjoyments and ethicthe once accepted comparative

classification79 of enjoyments according to which an inferior higher

highest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment now decides as to

ethical status or unethical status a lower enjoyment for example

sensual pleasure preferred to a more highly esteemed one for example

health rates as unethical as does welfare preferred to freedom the

comparative classification of enjoyments is not however alike or the

same at all periods when anyone demands satisfaction of the law he is

from the point of view of an earlier civilization moral from that of

the present nonmoral unethical indicates therefore that a man is

not sufficiently sensible to the higher finer impulses which the

present civilization has brought with it or is not sensible to them at

all it indicates backwardness but only from the point of view of the

contemporary degree of distinctionthe comparative classification of

enjoyments itself is not determined according to absolute ethics but

after each new ethical adjustment it is then decided whether conduct be

ethical or the reverse
43
inhuman men as survivalsmen who are now inhuman must serve us as

surviving specimens of earlier civilizations the mountain height80 of

humanity here reveals its lower formations which might otherwise remain

hidden from view there are surviving specimens of humanity whose brains

through the vicissitudes of heredity have escaped proper development

they show us what we all were and thus appal us but they are as little

responsible on this account as is a piece of granite for being granite

in our own brains there must be courses and windings corresponding to

such characters just as in the forms of some human organs there survive

traces of fishhood but these courses and windings are no longer the bed

in which flows the stream of our feeling
44
gratitude and revengethe reason the powerful man is grateful is this

his benefactor has through his benefaction invaded the domain of the

powerful man and established himself on an equal footing the powerful

man in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and gets satisfaction

through the act of gratitude it is a mild form of revenge by not

obtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would have shown

himself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward hence every

society of the good that is to say of the powerful originally81 places

gratitude among the first of dutiesswift has added the dictum that

man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful
45
twofold historical origin of good and evilthe notion of good and bad

has a twofold historical origin namely first in the spirit of ruling

races and castes whoever has power to requite good with good and evil

with evil and actually brings requital that is is grateful and

revengeful acquires the name of being good whoever is powerless and

cannot requite is called bad a man belongs as a good individual to

the good of a community who have a feeling in common because all the

individuals are allied with one another through the requiting sentiment

a man belongs as a bad individual to the bad to a mass of

subjugated powerless men who have no feeling in common the good are a

caste the bad are a quantity like dust good and bad is for a

considerable period tantamount to noble and servile master and slave

on the other hand an enemy is not looked upon as bad he can requite

the trojan and the greek are in homer both good not he who does no

harm but he who is despised is deemed bad in the community of the

good individuals the quality of goodness is inherited it is

impossible for82 a bad individual to grow from such a rich soil if

notwithstanding one of the good individuals does something unworthy of

his goodness recourse is had to exorcism thus the guilt is ascribed to

a deity the while it is declared that this deity bewitched the good man

into madness and blindnesssecond in the spirit of the subjugated

the powerless here every other man is to the individual hostile

inconsiderate greedy inhuman avaricious be he noble or servile bad

is the characteristic term for man for every living being indeed that

is recognized at all even for a god human divine these notions are

tantamount to devilish bad manifestations of goodness sympathy

helpfulness are regarded with anxiety as trickiness preludes to an

evil end deception subtlety in short as refined badness with such a

predisposition in individuals a feeling in common can scarcely arise at

all at most only the rudest form of it so that everywhere that this

conception of good and evil prevails the destruction of the

individuals their race and nation is imminentour existing morality

has developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and castes
46
sympathy greater than sufferingthere are circumstances in which

sympathy is stronger83 than the suffering itself we feel more pain for

instance when one of our friends becomes guilty of a reprehensible

action than if we had done the deed ourselves we once that is had

more faith in the purity of his character than he had himself hence our

love for him apparently because of this very faith is stronger than

is his own love for himself if indeed his egoism really suffers more

as a result than our egoism inasmuch as he must take the consequences

of his fault to a greater extent than ourselves nevertheless the

unegoisticthis word is not to be taken too strictly but simply as a

modified form of expressionin us is more affected by his guilt than

the unegoistic in him
47
hypochondriathere are people who from sympathy and anxiety for

others become hypochondriacal the resulting form of compassion is

nothing else than sickness so also is there a christian hypochondria

from which those singular religiously agitated people suffer who place

always before their eyes the suffering and death of christ
48
economy of blessingsthe advantageous and the pleasing as the

healthiest growths and84 powers in the intercourse of men are such

precious treasures that it is much to be wished the use made of these

balsamic means were as economical as possible but this is impossible

economy in the use of blessings is the dream of the craziest of

utopians
49
wellwishingamong the small but infinitely plentiful and therefore

very potent things to which science must pay more attention than to the

great uncommon things wellwishing21 must be reckoned i mean those

manifestations of friendly disposition in intercourse that laughter of

the eye every hand pressure every courtesy from which in general

every human act gets its quality every teacher every functionary adds

this element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty it is the

perpetual well spring of humanity like the waves of light in which

everything grows thus in the narrowest circles within the family

life blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling the

cheerfulness 85friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailing

sources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilization

than those other more noised manifestations of it that are styled

sympathy benevolence and sacrifice but it is customary to depreciate

these little tokens of kindly feeling and indeed there is not much of

the unegoistic in them the sum of these little doses is very great

nevertheless their combined strength is of the greatest of

strengthsthus too much more happiness is to be found in the world

than gloomy eyes discover that is if the calculation be just and all

these pleasing moments in which every day even the meanest human life

is rich be not forgotten
21 wohlwollen kind feeling it stands here for benevolence

but not benevolence in the restricted sense of the word now prevailing
50
the desire to inspire compassionla rochefoucauld in the most notable

part of his self portraiture first printed 1658 reaches the vital spot

of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be on their

guard against compassion when he advises that this sentiment be left to

men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of the emotions

since they are not guided by reason to induce them to give aid to the

suffering and to be of service in misfortune86 whereas compassion in

his and platos view deprives the heart of strength to be sure

sympathy should be manifested but men should take care not to feel it

for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that the manifestation of

sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in the worldperhaps a

more effectual warning against this compassion can be given if this need

of the unfortunate be considered not simply as stupidity and

intellectual weakness not as a sort of distraction of the spirit

entailed by misfortune itself and thus indeed does la rochefoucauld

seem to view it but as something quite different and more momentous

let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to be

compassionated and who therefore await the moment when their condition

will be observed come into contact with the sick and the oppressed in

spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing the posturing

and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim the causing of pain

to the beholder the sympathy which each beholder manifests is a

consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much as they are made

to perceive that at least they have the power notwithstanding all their

weakness to inflict pain the unfortunate experiences a species of joy

in the sense of superiority which the manifestation of sympathy entails

his imagination87 is exalted he is always strong enough then to cause

the world pain thus is the thirst for sympathy a thirst for self

enjoyment and at the expense of ones fellow creatures it shows man in

the whole ruthlessness of his own dear self not in his mere dullness

as la rochefoucauld thinksin social conversation three fourths of all

the questions are asked and three fourths of all the replies are made

in order to inflict some little pain that is why so many people crave

social intercourse it gives them a sense of their power in these

countless but very small doses in which the quality of badness is

administered it proves a potent stimulant of life to the same extent

that well wishingwohlwollen distributed through the world in like

manner is one of the ever ready restorativesbut will many honorable

people be found to admit that there is any pleasure in administering

pain that entertainmentand rare entertainmentis not seldom found in

causing others at least in thought some pain and in raking them with

the small shot of wickedness the majority are too ignoble and a few are

too good to know anything of this pudendum the latter may

consequently be prompt to deny that prosper mrime is right when he

says know also that nothing is more common than to do wrong for the

pleasure of doing it88
51
how appearance becomes realitythe actor cannot at last refrain

even in moments of the deepest pain from thinking of the effect

produced by his deportment and by his surroundingsfor example even at

the funeral of his own child he will weep at his own sorrow and its

manifestations as though he were his own audience the hypocrite who

always plays one and the same part finally ceases to be a hypocrite as

in the case of priests who when young men are always either

consciously or unconsciously hypocrites and finally become naturally

and then really without affectation mere priests or if the father

does not carry it to this extent the son who inherits his fathers

calling and gets the advantage of the paternal progress does when

anyone during a long period and persistently wishes to appear

something it will at last prove difficult for him to be anything else

the calling of almost every man even of the artist begins with

hypocrisy with an imitation of deportment with a copying of the

effective in manner he who always wears the mask of a friendly man must

at last gain a power over friendliness of disposition without which the

expression itself of friendliness is not to be gainedand finally

friendliness of disposition gains the ascendancy over himhe is

benevolent89
52
the point of honor in deceptionin all great deceivers one

characteristic is prominent to which they owe their power in the very

act of deception amid all the accompaniments the agitation in the

voice the expression the bearing in the crisis of the scene there

comes over them a belief in themselves this it is that acts so

effectively and irresistibly upon the beholders founders of religions

differ from such great deceivers in that they never come out of this

state of self deception or else they have very rarely a few moments

of enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt generally

however they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments of

enlightenment to the evil adversary self deception must exist that both

classes of deceivers may attain far reaching results for men believe in

the truth of all that is manifestly believed with due implicitness by

others
53
presumed degrees of truthone of the most usual errors of deduction

is because someone truly and openly is against us therefore he speaks

the truth hence the child has faith in the judgments of its elders the

christian in the90 assertions of the founder of the church so too it

will not be admitted that all for which men sacrificed life and

happiness in former centuries was nothing but delusion perhaps it is

alleged these things were degrees of truth but what is really meant is

that if a person sincerely believes a thing and has fought and died for

his faith it would be too unjust if only delusion had inspired him

such a state of affairs seems to contradict eternal justice for that

reason the heart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head the

judgment between moral conduct and intellectual insight there must

always exist an inherent connection it is unfortunately otherwise

for there is no eternal justice
54
falsehoodwhy do men as a rule speak the truth in the ordinary

affairs of life certainly not for the reason that a god has forbidden

lying but because first it is more convenient as falsehood entails

invention makebelieve and recollection wherefore swift says that

whoever invents a lie seldom realises the heavy burden he takes up he

must namely for every lie that he tells insert twenty more

therefore because in plain ordinary relations of life it is expedient

to say without circumlocution i want91 this i have done this and the

like therefore because the way of freedom and certainty is surer than

that of rusebut if it happens that a child is brought up in sinister

domestic circumstances it will then indulge in falsehood as matter of

course and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt an

inclination for truth an aversion to falsehood is quite foreign and

uncongenial to it and hence it lies in all innocence
55
ethic discredited for faiths sakeno power can sustain itself when it

is represented by mere humbugs the catholic church may possess ever so

many worldly sources of strength but its true might is comprised in

those still numberless priestly natures who make their lives stern and

strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are eloquent of night

vigils fasts ardent prayer perhaps even of whip lashes these things

make men tremble and cause them anxiety what if it be really

imperative to live thus this is the dreadful question which their

aspect occasions as they spread this doubt they lay anew the prop of

their power even the free thinkers dare not oppose such

disinterestedness with severe truth and cry thou deceived one92

deceive notonly the difference of standpoint separates them from

him no difference in goodness or badness but things we cannot

accomplish ourselves we are apt to criticise unfairly thus we are told

of the cunning and perverted acts of the jesuits but we overlook the

self mastery that each jesuit imposes upon himself and also the fact

that the easy life which the jesuit manuals advocate is for the benefit

not of the jesuits but the laity indeed it may be questioned whether

we enlightened ones would become equally competent workers as the result

of similar tactics and organization and equally worthy of admiration as

the result of self mastery indefatigable industry and devotion
56
victory of knowledge over radical evilit proves a material gain to

him who would attain knowledge to have had during a considerable period

the idea that mankind is a radically bad and perverted thing it is a

false idea as is its opposite but it long held sway and its roots have

reached down even to ourselves and our present world in order to

understand ourselves we must understand it but in order to attain a

loftier height we must step above it we then perceive that there is no

such thing as sin in the93 metaphysical sense but also in the same

sense no such thing as virtue that this whole domain of ethical

notions is one of constant variation that there are higher and deeper

conceptions of good and evil moral and immoral whoever desires no more

of things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of mind and

will at most err through lack of knowledge but scarcely through

eagerness for knowledge or through sin as the world calls it he will

not ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and rooted out but

his single all powerful ambition to know as thoroughly and as fully

as possible will soothe him and moderate all that is strenuous in his

circumstances moreover he is now rid of a number of disturbing

notions he is no longer beguiled by such words as hellpain

sinfulness unworthiness he sees in them merely the flitting shadow

pictures of false views of life and of the world
57
ethic as mans selfanalysisa good author whose heart is really in

his work wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if only

thereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain the maid in love

wishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passion94 through

the faithlessness of her beloved the soldier wishes to sacrifice his

life on the field of his fatherlands victory for in the victory of his

fatherland his highest end is attained the mother gives her child what

she deprives herself ofsleep the best nourishment and in certain

circumstances her health her selfbut are all these acts unegoistic

are these moral deeds miracles because they are in schopenhauers

phrase impossible and yet accomplished is it not evident that in all

four cases man loves one part of himself a thought a longing an

experience more than he loves another part of himself that he thus

analyses his being and sacrifices one part of it to another part is

this essentially different from the behavior of the obstinate man who

says i would rather be shot than go a step out of my way for this

fellowpreference for something wish impulse longing is present

in all four instances to yield to it with all its consequences is not

unegoisticin the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not as

individuum but as dividuum
58
what can be promisedactions can be promised but not feelings for

these are involuntary whoever promises somebody to love95 him always or

to hate him always or to be ever true to him promises something that

it is out of his power to bestow but he really can promise such courses

of conduct as are the ordinary accompaniments of love of hate of

fidelity but which may also have their source in motives quite

different for various ways and motives lead to the same conduct the

promise to love someone always means consequently as long as i love

you i will manifest the deportment of love but if i cease to love you

my deportment although from some other motive will be just the same

so that to the people about us it will seem as if my love remained

unchangedhence it is the continuance of the deportment of love that

is promised in every instance in which eternal love provided no element

of self deception be involved is sworn
59
intellect and ethicone must have a good memory to be able to keep the

promises one makes one must have a strong imagination in order to feel

sympathy so closely is ethics connected with intellectual capacity
60
desire for vengeance and vengeance itselfto meditate revenge and

attain it is tantamount96 to an attack of fever that passes away but to

meditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain it

is tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady or poisoning of body

and soul ethics which takes only the motive into account rates both

cases alike people generally estimate the first case as the worst

because of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may entail

both views are short sighted
61
ability to waitability to wait is so hard to acquire that great poets

have not disdained to make inability to wait the central motive of their

poems so shakespeare in othello sophocles in ajax whose suicide would

not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to cool his

ardor for a day as the oracle foreboded apparently he would then have

repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought and have

said to himself who has not already in my situation mistaken a sheep

for a hero is it so extraordinary a thing on the contrary it is

something universally human ajax should thus have soothed himself

passion will not wait the tragic element in the lives of great men does

not generally consist in their97 conflict with time and the inferiority

of their fellowmen but in their inability to put off their work a year

or two they cannot waitin all duels the friends who advise have but

to ascertain if the principals can wait if this be not possible a duel

is rational inasmuch as each of the combatants may say either i

continue to live and the other dies instantly or vice versa to wait

in such circumstances would be equivalent to the frightful martyrdom of

enduring dishonor in the presence of him responsible for the dishonor

and this can easily cost more anguish than life is worth
62
glutting revengecoarse men who feel a sense of injury are in the

habit of rating the extent of their injury as high as possible and of

stating the occasion of it in greatly exaggerated language in order to

be able to feast themselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thus

aroused
63
value of disparagementnot a few perhaps the majority of men find it

necessary in order to retain their self esteem and a certain98

uprightness in conduct to mentally disparage and belittle all the

people they know but as the inferior natures are in the majority and as

a great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this uprightness

so
64
the man in a ragewe should be on our guard against the man who is

enraged against us as against one who has attempted our life for the

fact that we still live consists solely in the inability to kill were

looks sufficient it would have been all up with us long since to

reduce anyone to silence by physical manifestations of savagery or by a

terrorizing process is a relic of under civilization so too that cold

look which great personages cast upon their servitors is a remnant of

the caste distinction between man and man a specimen of rude antiquity

women the conservers of the old have maintained this survival too

more perfectly than men
65
whither honesty may leadsomeone once had the bad habit of expressing

himself99 upon occasion and with perfect honesty on the subject of the

motives of his conduct which were as good or as bad as the motives of

all men he aroused first disfavor then suspicion became gradually of

ill repute and was pronounced a person of whom society should beware

until at last the law took note of such a perverted being for reasons

which usually have no weight with it or to which it closes its eyes

lack of taciturnity concerning what is universally held secret and an

irresponsible predisposition to see what no one wants to

seeoneselfbrought him to prison and to early death
66
punishable not punishedour crime against criminals consists in the

fact that we treat them as rascals
67
sancta simplicitas of virtueevery virtue has its privilege for

funeral pyre of one condemned100
68
morality and consequencenot alone the beholders of an act generally

estimate the ethical or unethical element in it by the result no the

one who performed the act does the same for the motives and the

intentions are seldom sufficiently apparent and amid them the memory

itself seems to become clouded by the results of the act so that a man

often ascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remote

motives as the direct ones success often imparts to an action all the

brilliance and honor of good intention while failure throws the shadow

of conscience over the most estimable deeds hence arises the familiar

maxim of the politician give me only success with it i can win all

the noble souls over to my sideand make myself noble even in my own

eyesin like manner will success prove an excellent substitute for a

better argument to this very day many well educated men think the

triumph of christianity over greek philosophy is a proof of the superior

truth of the formeralthough in this case it was simply the coarser and

more powerful that triumphed over the more delicate and intellectual as

regards superiority of truth it is evident that because of it the

reviving sciences have connected themselves point for point with the

philosophy of101 epicurus while christianity has point for point

recoiled from it
69
love and justicewhy is love so highly prized at the expense of

justice and why are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if it

were a far higher entity than the latter is the former not palpably a

far more stupid thing than the lattercertainly and on that very

account so much the more agreeable to everybody it is blind and has a

rich horn of plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyone

even when they are unmerited even when no thanks are returned it is

impartial like the rain which according to the bible and experience

wets not alone the unjust but in certain circumstances the just as

well and to their skins at that
70
executionhow comes it that every execution causes us more pain than a

murder it is the coolness of the executioner the painful preparation

the perception that here a man is being used as an instrument for the

intimidation of others for the guilt is not punished even if there be

any this is ascribable to the teachers102 the parents the environment

in ourselves not in the murdereri mean the predisposing

circumstances
71
hopepandora brought the box containing evils and opened it it was

the gift of the gods to men a gift of most enticing appearance

externally and called the box of happiness thereupon all the evils

living moving things flew out from that time to the present they fly

about and do ill to men by day and night one evil only did not fly out

of the box pandora shut the lid at the behest of zeus and it remained

inside now man has this box of happiness perpetually in the house and

congratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it it is at his

service he grasps it whenever he is so disposed for he knows not that

the box which pandora brought was a box of evils hence he looks upon

the one evil still remaining as the greatest source of happinessit is

hopezeus intended that man notwithstanding the evils oppressing him

should continue to live and not rid himself of life but keep on making

himself miserable for this purpose he bestowed hope upon man it is in

truth the greatest of evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man103
72
degree of moral susceptibility unknownthe fact that one has or has

not had certain profoundly moving impressions and insights into

thingsfor example an unjustly executed slain or martyred father a

faithless wife a shattering serious accidentis the factor upon

which the excitation of our passions to white heat principally depends

as well as the course of our whole lives no one knows to what lengths

circumstances sympathy emotion may lead him he does not know the

full extent of his own susceptibility wretched environment makes him

wretched it is as a rule not the quality of our experience but its

quantity upon which depends the development of our superiority or

inferiority from the point of view of good and evil
73
the martyr against his willin a certain movement there was a man who

was too cowardly and vacillating ever to contradict his comrades he was

made use of in each emergency every sacrifice was demanded of him

because he feared the disfavor of his comrades more than he feared

death he was a petty abject spirit they perceived this and upon the

foundation of the qualities just mentioned they104 elevated him to the

altitude of a hero and finally even of a martyr although the cowardly

creature always inwardly said no he always said yes with his lips even

upon the scaffold where he died for the tenets of his party for beside

him stood one of his old associates who so domineered him with look and

word that he actually went to his death with the utmost fortitude and

has ever since been celebrated as a martyr and exalted character

vanity ordinary actions to habit and mean actions to fear
75
misunderstanding of virtuewhoever has obtained his experience of vice

in connection with pleasure as in the case of one with a youth of wild

oats behind him comes to the conclusion that virtue must be connected

with self denial whoever on the other hand has been very much plagued

by his passions and vices longs to find in virtue the rest and peace of

the soul that is why it is possible for two virtuous people to

misunderstand one another wholly105
76

77
honor transferred from persons to thingsactions prompted by love or

by the spirit of self sacrifice for others are universally honored

wherever they are manifest hence is magnified the value set upon

whatever things may be loved or whatever things conduce to self

sacrifice although in themselves they may be worth nothing much a

valiant army is evidence of the value of the thing it fights for
78
ambition a substitute for moral feelingmoral feeling should never

become extinct in natures that are destitute of ambition the ambitious

can get along without moral feeling just as well as with ithence the

sons of retired ambitionless families generally become by a series of

rapid gradations when they lose moral feeling the most absolute

lunkheads

80
senility and deathapart from the demands made by religion it may

well be asked why it is more honorable in an aged man who feels the

decline of his powers to await slow extinction than to fix a term to

his existence himself suicide in such a case is a quite natural and due

proceeding that ought to command respect as a triumph of reason and did

in fact command respect during the times of the masters of greek

philosophy and the bravest roman patriots who usually died by their own

hand eagerness on the other hand to keep alive from day to day with

the anxious counsel of physicians without capacity to attain any nearer

to ones ideal of life is far less worthy of respectreligions are

very rich in refuges from the mandate of suicide hence they ingratiate

themselves with those who cling to life
81
delusions regarding victim and regarding evil doerwhen the rich man

takes a107 possession away from the poor man for example a prince who

deprives a plebeian of his beloved there arises in the mind of the poor

man a delusion he thinks the rich man must be wholly perverted to take

from him the little that he has but the rich man appreciates the value

of a single possession much less because he is accustomed to many

possessions so that he cannot put himself in the place of the poor man

and does not act by any means as ill as the latter supposes both have a

totally false idea of each other the iniquities of the mighty which

bulk most largely in history are not nearly so monstrous as they seem

the hereditary consciousness of being a superior being with superior

environment renders one very callous and lulls the conscience to rest

we all feel when the difference between ourselves and some other being

is exceedingly great that no element of injustice can be involved and

we kill a fly with no qualms of conscience whatever so too it is no

indication of wickedness in xerxes whom even the greeks represent as

exceptionally noble that he deprived a father of his son and had him

drawn and quartered because the latter had manifested a troublesome

ominous distrust of an entire expedition the individual was in this

case brushed aside as a pestiferous insect he was too low and mean to

justify continued sentiments of108 compunction in the ruler of the world

indeed no cruel man is ever as cruel in the main as his victim thinks

the idea of pain is never the same as the sensation the rule is

precisely analogous in the case of the unjust judge and of the

journalist who by means of devious rhetorical methods leads public

opinion astray cause and effect are in all these instances entwined

with totally different series of feeling and thoughts whereas it is

unconsciously assumed that principal and victim feel and think exactly

alike and because of this assumption the guilt of the one is based upon

the pain of the other

89
vanitywe set store by the good opinion of men first because it is of

use to us and next110 because we wish to give them pleasure children

their parents pupils their teacher and well disposed persons all

others generally only when the good opinion of men is important to

somebody apart from personal advantage or the desire to give pleasure

do we speak of vanity in this last case a man wants to give himself

pleasure but at the expense of his fellow creatures inasmuch as he

inspires them with a false opinion of himself or else inspires good

opinion in such a way that it is a source of pain to others by

arousing envy the individual generally seeks through the opinion of

others to attest and fortify the opinion he has of himself but the

potent influence of authorityan influence as old as man himselfleads

many also to strengthen their own opinion of themselves by means of

authority that is to borrow from others the expedient of relying more

upon the judgment of their fellow men than upon their owninterest in

oneself the wish to please oneself attains with the vain man such

proportions that he first misleads others into a false unduly exalted

estimate of himself and then relies upon the authority of others for his

self estimate he thus creates the delusion that he pins his faith

toit must however be admitted that the vain man does not desire to

please others so much as himself and he will often go so far111 on this

account as to overlook his own interests for he often inspires his

fellow creatures with malicious envy and renders them ill disposed in

order that he may thus increase his own delight in himself

92
origin of justicejustice reasonableness has its origin among

approximate equals in power as thucydides in the dreadful conferences

of the athenian and melian envoys has112 rightly conceived thus where

there exists no demonstrable supremacy and a struggle leads but to

mutual useless damage the reflection arises that an understanding

would best be arrived at and some compromise entered into the

reciprocal nature is hence the first nature of justice each party makes

the other content inasmuch as each receives what it prizes more highly

than the other each surrenders to the other what the other wants and

receives in return its own desire justice is therefore reprisal and

exchange upon the basis of an approximate equality of power thus

revenge pertains originally to the domain of justice as it is a sort of

reciprocity equally so gratitudejustice reverts naturally to the

standpoint of self preservation therefore to the egoism of this

consideration why should i injure myself to no purpose and perhaps

never attain my endso much for the origin of justice only because

men through mental habits have forgotten the original motive of so

called just and rational acts and also because for thousands of years

children have been brought to admire and imitate such acts have they

gradually assumed the appearance of being unegotistical upon this

appearance is founded the high estimate of them which moreover like

all estimates is continually developing for whatever is highly

esteemed is striven for imitated113 made the object of self sacrifice

while the merit of the pain and emulation thus expended is by each

individual ascribed to the thing esteemedhow slightly moral would

the world appear without forgetfulness a poet could say that god had

posted forgetfulness as a sentinel at the portal of the temple of human

merit
93
concerning the law of the weakerwhenever any party for instance a

besieged city yields to a stronger party under stipulated conditions

the counter stipulation is that there be a reduction to insignificance

a burning and destruction of the city and thus a great damage inflicted

upon the stronger party thus arises a sort of equalization principle

upon the basis of which a law can be established the enemy has an

advantage to gain by its maintenanceto this extent there is also a

law between slaves and masters limited only by the extent to which the

slave may be useful to his master the law goes originally only so far

as the one party may appear to the other potent invincible stable and

the like to such an extent then the weaker has rights but very

limited ones hence the famous dictum that each has as much law on his

side as his power extends or more accurately as his power is believed

to extend114
94
the three phases of morality hithertoit is the first evidence that

the animal has become human when his conduct ceases to be based upon the

immediately expedient but upon the permanently useful when he has

therefore grown utilitarian capable of purpose thus is manifested the

first rule of reason a still higher stage is attained when he regulates

his conduct upon the basis of honor by means of which he gains mastery

of himself and surrenders his desires to principles this lifts him far

above the phase in which he was actuated only by considerations of

personal advantage as he understood it he respects and wishes to be

respected this means that he comprehends utility as a thing dependent

upon what his opinion of others is and their opinion of him finally he

regulates his conduct the highest phase of morality hitherto attained

by his own standard of men and things he himself decides for himself

and for others what is honorable and what is useful he has become a

law giver to opinion upon the basis of his ever higher developing

conception of the utilitarian and the honorable knowledge makes him

capable of placing the highest utility that is the universal

enduring utility before merely personal utilityof placing ennobling115

recognition of the enduring and universal before the merely temporary

he lives and acts as a collective individuality
95
ethic of the developed individualhitherto the altruistic has been

looked upon as the distinctive characteristic of moral conduct and it

is manifest that it was the consideration of universal utility that

prompted praise and recognition of altruistic conduct must not a

radical departure from this point of view be imminent now that it is

being ever more clearly perceived that in the most personal

considerations the most general welfare is attained so that conduct

inspired by the most personal considerations of advantage is just the

sort which has its origin in the present conception of morality as a

universal utilitarianism to contemplate oneself as a complete

personality and bear the welfare of that personality in mind in all that

one doesthis is productive of better results than any sympathetic

susceptibility and conduct in behalf of others indeed we all suffer

from such disparagement of our own personalities which are at present

made to deteriorate from neglect capacity is in fact divorced from

our personality in most cases and sacrificed to the state to116 science

to the needy as if it were the bad which deserved to be made a

sacrifice now we are willing to labor for our fellowmen but only to

the extent that we find our own highest advantage in so doing no more

no less the whole matter depends upon what may be understood as ones

advantage the crude undeveloped rough individualities will be the

very ones to estimate it most inadequately
96
usage and ethicto be moral virtuous praiseworthy means to yield

obedience to ancient law and hereditary usage whether this obedience be

rendered readily or with difficulty is long immaterial enough that it

be rendered good finally comes to mean him who acts in the

traditional manner as a result of heredity or natural disposition that

is to say does what is customary with scarcely an effort whatever that

may be for example revenges injuries when revenge as with the ancient

greeks was part of good morals he is called good because he is good

to some purpose and as benevolence sympathy considerateness

moderation and the like come in the general course of conduct to be

finally recognized as good to some purpose as utilitarian the

benevolent man the helpful117 man is duly styled good at first other

and more important kinds of utilitarian qualities stand in the

foreground bad is not habitual unusual to do things not in

accordance with usage to oppose the traditional however rational or

the reverse the traditional may be to do injury to ones social group

or community and to ones neighbor as thus understood is looked upon

through all the variations of moral laws in different ages as the

peculiarly immoral act so that today we associate the word bad

with deliberate injury to ones neighbor or community egoistic and

nonegoistic do not constitute the fundamental opposites that have

brought mankind to make a distinction between moral and immoral good

and bad but adherence to traditional custom and emancipation from it

how the traditional had its origin is quite immaterial in any event it

had no reference to good and bad or any categorical imperative but to

the all important end of maintaining and sustaining the community the

race the confederation the nation every superstitious custom that

originated in a misinterpreted event or casualty entailed some

tradition to adhere to which is moral to break loose from it is

dangerous more prejudicial to the community than to the individual

because divinity visits the consequences of impiety and sacrilege upon

the community rather118 than upon the individual now every tradition

grows ever more venerablethe more remote is its origin the more

confused that origin is the reverence due to it increases from

generation to generation the tradition finally becomes holy and

inspires awe thus it is that the precept of piety is a far loftier

morality than that inculcated by altruistic conduct
97
delight in the morala potent species of joy and thereby the source

of morality is custom the customary is done more easily better

therefore preferably a pleasure is felt in it and experience thus shows

that since this practice has held its own it must be good a manner or

moral that lives and lets live is thus demonstrated advantageous

necessary in contradistinction to all new and not yet adopted

practices the custom is therefore the blending of the agreeable and the

useful moreover it does not require deliberation as soon as man can

exercise compulsion he exercises it to enforce and establish his

customs for they are to him attested lifewisdom so too a community

of individuals constrains each one of their number to adopt the same

moral or custom the error herein is this because a certain custom119 has

been agreeable to the feelings or at least because it proves a means of

maintenance this custom must be imperative for it is regarded as the

only thing that can possibly be consistent with well being the well

being of life seems to spring from it alone this conception of the

customary as a condition of existence is carried into the slightest

detail of morality inasmuch as insight into true causation is quite

restricted in all inferior peoples a superstitious anxiety is felt that

everything be done in due routine even when a custom is exceedingly

burdensome it is preserved because of its supposed vital utility it is

not known that the same degree of satisfaction can be experienced

through some other custom and even higher degrees of satisfaction too

but it is fully appreciated that all customs do become more agreeable

with the lapse of time no matter how difficult they may have been found

in the beginning and that even the severest way of life may be rendered

a matter of habit and therefore a pleasure
98
pleasure and social instinctthrough his relations with other men man

derives a new species of delight in those pleasurable emotions which his

own personality affords him whereby120 the domain of pleasurable emotions

is made infinitely more comprehensive no doubt he has inherited many of

these feelings from the brutes which palpably feel delight when they

sport with one another as mothers with their young so too the sexual

relations must be taken into account they make every young woman

interesting to every young man from the standpoint of pleasure and

conversely the feeling of pleasure originating in human relationships

makes men in general better the delight in common the pleasures

enjoyed together heighten one another the individual feels a sense of

security he becomes better natured distrust and malice dissolve for

the man feels the sense of benefit and observes the same feeling in

others mutual manifestations of pleasure inspire mutual sympathy the

sentiment of homogeneity the same effect is felt also at mutual

sufferings in a common danger in stormy weather upon such a

foundation are built the earliest alliances the object of which is the

mutual protection and safety from threatening misfortunes and the

welfare of each individual and thus the social instinct develops from

pleasure
99
the guiltless nature of socalled bad actsall bad acts are inspired

by the impulse121 to self preservation or more accurately by the desire

for pleasure and for the avoidance of pain in the individual thus are

they occasioned but they are not therefore bad pain self prepared

does not exist except in the brains of the philosophers any more than

pleasure self prepared sympathy in the schopenhauer sense in the

condition anterior to the state we kill the creature be it man or ape

that attempts to pluck the fruit of a tree before we pluck it ourselves

should we happen to be hungry at the time and making for that tree as

we would do today so far as the brute is concerned if we were

wandering in savage regionsthe bad acts which most disturb us at

present do so because of the erroneous supposition that the one who is

guilty of them towards us has a free will in the matter and that it was

within his discretion not to have done these evil things this belief in

discretionary power inspires hate thirst for revenge malice the

entire perversion of the mental processes whereas we would feel in no

way incensed against the brute as we hold it irresponsible to inflict

pain not from the instinct of self preservation but in requitalthis is

the consequence of false judgment and is equally a guiltless course of

conduct the individual can in that condition which is anterior to the

state act with fierceness and violence for the intimidation122 of another

creature in order to render his own power more secure as a result of

such acts of intimidation thus acts the powerful the superior the

original state founder who subjugates the weaker he has the right to

do so as the state nowadays assumes the same right or to be more

accurate there is no right that can conflict with this a foundation

for all morality can first be laid only when a stronger individuality or

a collective individuality for example society the state subjects the

single personalities hence builds upon their unification and

establishes a bond of union morality results from compulsion it is

indeed itself one long compulsion to which obedience is rendered in

order that pain may be avoided at first it is but custom later free

obedience and finally almost instinct at last it is like everything

habitual and natural associated with pleasureand is then called

virtue
100
shameshame exists wherever a mystery exists but this is a

religious notion which in the earlier period of human civilization had

great vogue everywhere there were circumscribed spots to which access

was denied on account of some divine law except in special

circumstances123 at first these spots were quite extensive inasmuch as

stipulated areas could not be trod by the uninitiated who when near

them felt tremors and anxieties this sentiment was frequently

transferred to other relationships for example to sexual relations

which as the privilege and gateway of mature age must be withdrawn

from the contemplation of youth for its own advantage relations which

many divinities were busy in preserving and sanctifying images of which

divinities were duly placed in marital chambers as guardians in

turkish such an apartment is termed a harem or holy thing the same word

also designating the vestibule of a mosque so too kingship is

regarded as a centre from which power and brilliance stream forth as a

mystery to the subjects impregnated with secrecy and shame sentiments

still quite operative among peoples who in other respects are without

any shame at all so too is the whole world of inward states the

socalled soul even now for all nonphilosophical persons a

mystery and during countless ages it was looked upon as a something

of divine origin in direct communion with deity it is therefore an

adytum and occasions shame
101
judge notcare must be taken in the contemplation of earlier ages

that there be no falling124 into unjust scornfulness the injustice in

slavery the cruelty in the subjugation of persons and peoples must not

be estimated by our standard for in that period the instinct of justice

was not so highly developed who dare reproach the genoese calvin for

burning the physician servetus at the stake it was a proceeding growing

out of his convictions and the inquisition too had its justification

the only thing is that the prevailing views were false and led to those

proceedings which seem so cruel to us simply because such views have

become foreign to us besides what is the burning alive of one

individual compared with eternal hell pains for everybody else and yet

this idea then had hold of all the world without in the least vitiating

with its frightfulness the other idea of a god even we nowadays are

hard and merciless to political revolutionists but that is because we

are in the habit of believing the state a necessity and hence the

cruelty of the proceeding is not so much understood as in the other

cases where the points of view are repudiated the cruelty to animals

shown by children and italians is due to the same misunderstanding the

animal owing to the exigencies of the church catechism is placed too

far below the level of mankindmuch too that is frightful and

inhuman in history and which is almost incredible is rendered125 less

atrocious by the reflection that the one who commands and the one who

executes are different persons the former does not witness the

performance and hence it makes no strong impression on him the latter

obeys a superior and hence feels no responsibility most princes and

military chieftains appear through lack of true perception cruel and

hard without really being soegoism is not bad because the idea of the

neighborthe word is of christian origin and does not correspond to

truthis very weak in us and we feel ourselves in regard to him as

free from responsibility as if plants and stones were involved that

another is in suffering must be learned and it can never be wholly

learned
102
man always does rightwe do not blame nature when she sends a

thunder storm and makes us wet why then do we term the man who inflicts

injury immoral because in the latter case we assume a voluntary

ruling free will and in the former necessity but this distinction is

a delusion moreover even the intentional infliction of injury is not

in all circumstances termed immoral thus we kill a fly intentionally126

without thinking very much about it simply because its buzzing about is

disagreeable and we punish a criminal and inflict pain upon him in

order to protect ourselves and society in the first case it is the

individual who for the sake of preserving himself or in order to spare

himself pain does injury with design in the second case it is the

state all ethic deems intentional infliction of injury justified by

necessity that is when it is a matter of self preservation but these

two points of view are sufficient to explain all bad acts done by man to

men it is desired to obtain pleasure or avoid pain in any sense it is

a question always of self preservation socrates and plato are right

whatever man does he always does right that is does what seems to him

good advantageous according to the degree of advancement his intellect

has attained which is always the measure of his rational capacity
103
the inoffensive in badnessbadness has not for its object the

infliction of pain upon others but simply our own satisfaction as for

instance in the case of thirst for vengeance or of nerve excitation

every act of teasing shows what pleasure is caused by the display of

our127 power over others and what feelings of delight are experienced in

the sense of domination is there then anything immoral in feeling

pleasure in the pain of others is malicious joy devilish as

schopenhauer says in the realm of nature we feel joy in breaking

boughs shattering rocks fighting with wild beasts simply to attest

our strength thereby should not the knowledge that another suffers on

our account here in this case make the same kind of act which by

the way arouses no qualms of conscience in us immoral also but if we

had not this knowledge there would be no pleasure in ones own

superiority or power for this pleasure is experienced only in the

suffering of another as in the case of teasing all pleasure is in

itself neither good nor bad whence comes the conviction that one

should not cause pain in others in order to feel pleasure oneself

simply from the standpoint of utility that is in consideration of the

consequences of ultimate pain since the injured party or state will

demand satisfaction and revenge this consideration alone can have led

to the determination to renounce such pleasuresympathy has the

satisfaction of others in view no more than as already stated badness

has the pain of others in view for there are at least two perhaps many

more elementary ingredients in personal gratification which enter

largely128 into our self satisfaction one of them being the pleasure of

the emotion of which species is sympathy with tragedy and another

when the impulse is to action being the pleasure of exercising ones

power should a sufferer be very dear to us we divest ourselves of pain

by the performance of acts of sympathywith the exception of some few

philosophers men have placed sympathy very low in the rank of moral

feelings and rightly
104
self defenceif self defence is in general held a valid justification

then nearly every manifestation of so called immoral egoism must be

justified too pain is inflicted robbery or killing done in order to

maintain life or to protect oneself and ward off harm a man lies when

cunning and delusion are valid means of self preservation to injure

intentionally when our safety and our existence are involved or the

continuance of our well being is conceded to be moral the state itself

injures from this motive when it hangs criminals in unintentional

injury the immoral of course can not be present as accident alone is

involved but is there any sort of intentional injury in which our

existence and the maintenance of our well being be not involved129 is

there such a thing as injuring from absolute badness for example in

the case of cruelty if a man does not know what pain an act occasions

that act is not one of wickedness thus the child is not bad to the

animal not evil it disturbs and rends it as if it were one of its

playthings does a man ever fully know how much pain an act may cause

another as far as our nervous system extends we shield ourselves from

pain if it extended further that is to our fellow men we would never

cause anyone else any pain except in such cases as we cause it to

ourselves when we cut ourselves surgically to heal our ills or

strive and trouble ourselves to gain health we conclude from analogy

that something pains somebody and can in consequence through

recollection and the power of imagination feel pain also but what a

difference there always is between the tooth ache and the pain

sympathy that the spectacle of tooth ache occasions therefore when

injury is inflicted from so called badness the degree of pain thereby

experienced is always unknown to us in so far however as pleasure is

felt in the act a sense of ones own power of ones own excitation

the act is committed to maintain the well being of the individual and

hence comes under the purview of self defence and lying for self

preservation without pleasure there is no130 life the struggle for

pleasure is the struggle for life whether the individual shall carry on

this struggle in such a way that he be called good or in such a way that

he be called bad is something that the standard and the capacity of his

own intellect must determine for him
105
justice that rewardswhoever has fully understood the doctrine of

absolute irresponsibility can no longer include the so called rewarding

and punishing justice in the idea of justice if the latter be taken to

mean that to each be given his due for he who is punished does not

deserve the punishment he is used simply as a means to intimidate

others from certain acts equally he who is rewarded does not merit the

reward he could not act any differently than he did act hence the

reward has only the significance of an encouragement to him and others

as a motive for subsequent acts the praise is called out only to him

who is running in the race and not to him who has arrived at the goal

something that comes to someone as his own is neither a punishment nor a

reward it is given to him from utiliarian considerations without his

having any claim to it in justice hence one must say the wise man

praises not131 because a good act has been done precisely as was once

said the wise man punishes not because a bad act has been done but in

order that a bad act may not be done if punishment and reward ceased

there would cease with them the most powerful incentives to certain acts

and away from other acts the purposes of men demand their continuance

of punishment and reward and inasmuch as punishment and reward blame

and praise operate most potently upon vanity these same purposes of men

imperatively require the continuance of vanity
106
the water fallat the sight of a water fall we may opine that in the

countless curves spirations and dashes of the waves we behold freedom

of the will and of the impulses but everything is compulsory

everything can be mathematically calculated thus it is too with human

acts we would be able to calculate in advance every single action if we

were all knowing as well as every advance in knowledge every delusion

every bad deed the acting individual himself is held fast in the

illusion of volition if on a sudden the entire movement of the world

stopped short and an all knowing and reasoning intelligence were there

to take advantage132 of this pause he could foretell the future of every

being to the remotest ages and indicate the path that would be taken in

the worlds further course the deception of the acting individual as

regards himself the assumption of the freedom of the will is a part of

this computable mechanism
107
nonresponsibility and nonguiltthe absolute irresponsibility of man

for his acts and his nature is the bitterest drop in the cup of him who

has knowledge if he be accustomed to behold in responsibility and duty

the patent of nobility of his human nature all his estimates

preferences dislikes are thus made worthless and false his deepest

sentiment with which he honored the sufferer the hero sprang from an

error he may no longer praise no longer blame for it is irrational to

blame and praise nature and necessity just as he cherishes the

beautiful work of art but does not praise it as it is incapable of

doing anything for itself just as he stands in the presence of plants

he must stand in the presence of human conduct his own included he may

admire strength beauty capacity therein but he can discern no merit

the chemical process and the conflict of the elements133 the ordeal of

the invalid who strives for convalescence are no more merits than the

soulstruggles and extremities in which one is torn this way and that by

contending motives until one finally decides in favor of the

strongestas the phrase has it although in fact it is the strongest

motive that decides for us all these motives however whatever fine

names we may give them have grown from the same roots in which we

believe the baneful poisons lurk between good and bad actions there is

no difference in kind but at most in degree good acts are sublimated

evil bad acts are degraded imbruted good the very longing of the

individual for self gratification together with the fear of being

deprived of it obtains satisfaction in all circumstances let the

individual act as he may that is as he must be it in deeds of vanity

revenge pleasure utility badness cunning be it in deeds of self

sacrifice sympathy or knowledge the degrees of rational capacity

determine the direction in which this longing impels every society

every individual has constantly present a comparative classification of

benefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others are

judged but this standard perpetually changes many acts are called bad

that are only stupid because the degree of intelligence that decided

for them was low indeed134 in a certain sense all acts now are stupid

for the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet been attained

will in time most certainly be surpassed and then in retrospection all

our present conduct and opinion will appear as narrow and petty as we

now deem the conduct and opinion of savage peoples and agesto

perceive all these things may occasion profound pain but there is

nevertheless a consolation such pains are birth pains the butterfly

insists upon breaking through the cocoon he presses through it tears

it to pieces only to be blinded and confused by the strange light by

the realm of liberty by such men as are capable of this sadnesshow

few there arewill the first attempt be made to see if humanity may

convert itself from a thing of morality to a thing of wisdom the sun of

a new gospel sheds its first ray upon the loftiest height in the souls

of those few but the clouds are massed there too thicker than ever

and not far apart are the brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom

everything is necessityso says the new knowledge and this knowledge

is itself necessity all is guiltlessness and knowledge is the way to

insight into this guiltlessness if pleasure egoism vanity be

necessary to attest the moral phenomena and their richest blooms the

instinct for truth and accuracy of knowledge if delusion135 and confusion

of the imagination were the only means whereby mankind could gradually

lift itself up to this degree of self enlightenment and self

emancipationwho would venture to disparage the means who would have

the right to feel sad if made aware of the goal to which those paths

lead everything in the domain of ethic is evolved changeable

tottering all things flow it is truebut all things are also in the

stream to their goal though within us the hereditary habit of

erroneous judgment love hate may be ever dominant yet under the

influence of awaking knowledge it will ever become weaker a new habit

that of understanding notloving nothating looking from above grows

up within us gradually and in the same soil and may perhaps in

thousands of years be powerful enough to endow mankind with capacity to

develop the wise guiltless man conscious of guiltlessness as

unfailingly as it now developes the unwise irrational guiltconscious

manthat is to say the necessary higher step not the opposite of it

108
the double contest against evilif an evil afflicts us we can either

so deal with it as to remove its cause or else so deal with it that its

effect upon our feeling is changed hence look upon the evil as a

benefit of which the uses will perhaps first become evident in some

subsequent period religion and art and also the metaphysical

philosophy strive to effect an alteration of the feeling partly by an

alteration of our judgment respecting the experience for example with

the aid of the dictum whom god loves he chastizes partly by the

awakening of a joy in pain in emotion especially whence the art of

tragedy had its origin the more one is disposed to interpret away and

justify the less likely he is to look directly at the causes of evil

and eliminate them an instant alleviation and narcotizing of pain as

is usual in the case of tooth ache is sufficient for him even in the

severest suffering the more the domination of religions and of all

narcotic arts declines the more searchingly do men look to the

elimination137 of evil itself which is a rather bad thing for the tragic

poetsfor there is ever less and less material for tragedy since the

domain of unsparing immutable destiny grows constantly more

circumscribedand a still worse thing for the priests for these last

have lived heretofore upon the narcoticizing of human ill
109
sorrow is knowledgehow willingly would not one exchange the false

assertions of the homines religiosi that there is a god who commands us

to be good who is the sentinel and witness of every act every moment

every thought who loves us who plans our welfare in every

misfortunehow willingly would not one exchange these for truths as

healing beneficial and grateful as those delusions but there are no

such truths philosophy can at most set up in opposition to them other

metaphysical plausibilities fundamental untruths as well the tragedy

of it all is that although one cannot believe these dogmas of religion

and metaphysics if one adopts in heart and head the potent methods of

truth one has yet become through human evolution so tender

susceptible sensitive as to stand in need of the most effective means

of rest and consolation from this138 state of things arises the danger

that through the perception of truth or more accurately seeing

through delusion one may bleed to death byron has put this into

deathless verse

sorrow is knowledge they who know the most
must mourn the deepest oer the fatal truth
the tree of knowledge is not that of life

against such cares there is no better protective than the light fancy of

horace at any rate during the darkest hours and sun eclipses of the

soul expressed in the words

quid aeternis minorem
consiliis animum fatigas
cur non sub alta vel platano vel hac
pinu jacentes22

22


then wherefore should you who are mortal outwear
your soul with a profitless burden of care
say why should we not flung at ease neath this pine
or a planetrees broad umbrage quaff gaily our wine
translation of sir theodore martin


at any rate light fancy or heavy heartedness of any degree must be

better than a romantic retrogression and desertion of ones flag an

approach to christianity in any form for with it in the present state

of knowledge one can have nothing to do without hopelessly defiling

ones intellectual integrity and surrendering it unconditionally these

woes may be painful enough but without pain one cannot become a leader

and guide of humanity and woe to him who would be such and lacks this

pure integrity of the intellect139
110
the truth in religionin the ages of enlightenment justice was not

done to the importance of religion of this there can be no doubt it is

also equally certain that in the ensuing reaction of enlightenment the

demands of justice were far exceeded inasmuch as religion was treated

with love even with infatuation and proclaimed as a profound indeed

the most profound knowledge of the world which science had but to

divest of its dogmatic garb in order to possess truth in its

unmythical form religions must thereforethis was the contention of

all foes of enlightenmentsensu allegorico with regard for the

comprehension of the masses give expression to that ancient truth which

is wisdom in itself inasmuch as all science of modern times has led up

to it instead of away from it so that between the most ancient wisdom

of man and all later wisdom there prevails harmony even similarity of

viewpoint and the advancement of knowledgeif one be disposed to

concede such a thinghas to do not with its nature but with its

propagation this whole conception of religion and science is through

and through erroneous and none would today be hardy enough to

countenance it had not schopenhauers rhetoric taken it under

protection this high sounding rhetoric which now gains140 auditors after

the lapse of a generation much as may be gained from schopenhauers

religioethical human and cosmical oracle as regards the comprehension

of christianity and other religions it is nevertheless certain that he

erred regarding the value of religion to knowledge he himself was in

this but a servile pupil of the scientific teachers of his time who had

all taken romanticism under their protection and renounced the spirit of

enlightenment had he been born in our own time it would have been

impossible for him to have spoken of the sensus allegoricus of religion

he would instead have done truth the justice to say never has a

religion directly or indirectly either as dogma or as allegory

contained a truth for all religions grew out of dread or necessity and

came into existence through an error of the reason they have perhaps

in times of danger from science incorporated some philosophical

doctrine or other into their systems in order to make it possible to

continue ones existence within them but this is but a theological work

of art dating from the time in which a religion began to doubt of

itself these theological feats of art which are most common in

christianity as the religion of a learned age impregnated with

philosophy have led to this superstition of the sensus allegoricus as

has even more the habit of the philosophers141 namely those

halfnatures the poetical philosophers and the philosophising artists

of dealing with their own feelings as if they constituted the

fundamental nature of humanity and hence of giving their own religious

feelings a predominant influence over the structure of their systems as

the philosophers mostly philosophised under the influence of hereditary

religious habits or at least under the traditional influence of this

metaphysical necessity they naturally arrived at conclusions closely

resembling the judaic or christian or indian religious

tenetsresembling in the way that children are apt to look like their

mothers only in this case the fathers were not certain as to the

maternity as easily happensbut in the innocence of their admiration

they fabled regarding the family likeness of all religion and science

in reality there exists between religion and true science neither

relationship nor friendship not even enmity they dwell in different

spheres every philosophy that lets the religious comet gleam through

the darkness of its last outposts renders everything within it that

purports to be science suspicious it is all probably religion

although it may assume the guise of sciencemoreover though all the

peoples agree concerning certain religious things for example the

existence of a god which by the way as regards this point142 is not

the case this fact would constitute an argument against the thing

agreed upon for example the very existence of a god the consensus

gentium and especially hominum can probably amount only to an absurdity

against it there is no consensus omnium sapientium whatever on any

point with the exception of which goethes verse speaks

all greatest sages to all latest ages
will smile wink and slily agree
tis folly to wait till a fools empty pate
has learned to be knowing and free
so children of wisdom must look upon fools
as creatures whore never the better for schools

stated without rhyme or metre and adapted to our case the consensus

sapientium is to the effect that the consensus gentium amounts to an

absurdity
111
origin of religious worshiplet us transport ourselves back to the

times in which religious life flourished most vigorously and we will

find a fundamental conviction prevalent which we no longer share and

which has resulted in the closing of the door to religious life once for

all so far as we are concerned this conviction has to do with nature

and intercourse with her in those times nothing is yet known of

natures laws neither for earth nor for heaven is there143 a must a

season sunshine rain can come or stay away as it pleases there is

wanting in particular all idea of natural causation if a man rows it

is not the oar that moves the boat but rowing is a magical ceremony

whereby a demon is constrained to move the boat all illness death

itself is a consequence of magical influences in sickness and death

nothing natural is conceived the whole idea of natural course is

wanting the idea dawns first upon the ancient greeks that is to say in

a very late period of humanity in the conception of a moira fate

ruling over the gods if any person shoots off a bow there is always an

irrational strength and agency in the act if the wells suddenly run

dry the first thought is of subterranean demons and their pranks it

must have been the dart of a god beneath whose invisible influence a

human being suddenly collapses in india the carpenter according to

lubbock is in the habit of making devout offerings to his hammer and

hatchet a brahmin treats the plume with which he writes a soldier the

weapon that he takes into the field a mason his trowel a laborer his

plow in the same way all nature is in the opinion of religious

people a sum total of the doings of conscious and willing beings an

immense mass of complex volitions in regard to all that takes place

outside of us no conclusion is permissible144 that anything will result

thus and so must result thus and so that we are comparatively

calculable and certain in our experiences that man is the rule nature

the ruleless this view forms the fundamental conviction that dominates

crude religionproducing early civilizations we contemporary men feel

exactly the opposite the richer man now feels himself inwardly the

more polyphone the music and the sounding of his soul the more

powerfully does the uniformity of nature impress him we all with

goethe recognize in nature the great means of repose for the soul we

listen to the pendulum stroke of this great clock with longing for rest

for absolute calm and quiescence as if we could drink in the uniformity

of nature and thereby arrive first at an enjoyment of oneself formerly

it was the reverse if we carry ourselves back to the periods of crude

civilization or if we contemplate contemporary savages we will find

them most strongly influenced by rule by tradition the individual is

almost automatically bound to rule and tradition and moves with the

uniformity of a pendulum to him naturethe uncomprehended fearful

mysterious naturemust seem the domain of freedom of volition of

higher power indeed as an ultrahuman degree of destiny as god every

individual in such periods and circumstances feels that his existence

his145 happiness the existence and happiness of the family the state

the success or failure of every undertaking must depend upon these

dispositions of nature certain natural events must occur at the proper

time and certain others must not occur how can influence be exercised

over this fearful unknown how can this domain of freedom be brought

under subjection thus he asks himself thus he worries is there no

means to render these powers of nature as subject to rule and tradition

as you are yourselfthe cogitation of the superstitious and

magicdeluded man is upon the theme of imposing a law upon nature and

to put it briefly religious worship is the result of such cogitation

the problem which is present to every man is closely connected with this

one how can the weaker party dictate laws to the stronger control its

acts in reference to the weaker at first the most harmless form of

influence is recollected that influence which is acquired when the

partiality of anyone has been won through beseeching and prayer

through abject humiliation through obligations to regular gifts and

propitiations through flattering homages it is possible therefore to

impose some guidance upon the forces of nature to the extent that their

partiality be won love binds and is bound then agreements can be

entered into by means of which certain146 courses of conduct are mutually

concluded vows are made and authorities prescribed but far more potent

is that species of power exercised by means of magic and incantation as

a man is able to injure a powerful enemy by means of the magician and

render him helpless with fear as the love potion operates at a

distance so can the mighty forces of nature in the opinion of weaker

mankind be controlled by similar means the principal means of

effecting incantations is to acquire control of something belonging to

the party to be influenced hair finger nails food from his table

even his picture or his name with such apparatus it is possible to act

by means of magic for the basic principle is that to everything

spiritual corresponds something corporeal with the aid of this

corporeal element the spirit may be bound injured or destroyed the

corporeal affords the handle by which the spiritual can be laid hold of

in the same way that man influences mankind does he influences some

spirit of nature for this latter has also its corporeal element that

can be grasped the tree and on the same basis the seed from which it

grew this puzzling sequence seems to demonstrate that in both forms the

same spirit is embodied now large now small a stone that suddenly

rolls is the body in which the spirit works does a huge boulder lie in

a147 lonely moor it is impossible to think of mortal power having placed

it there the stone must have moved itself there that is to say some

spirit must dominate it everything that has a body is subject to magic

including therefore the spirits of nature if a god is directly

connected with his portrait a direct influence by refraining from

devout offerings by whippings chainings and the like can be brought

to bear upon him the lower classes in china tie cords around the

picture of their god in order to defy his departing favor when he has

left them in the lurch and tear the picture to pieces drag it through

the streets into dung heaps and gutters crying you dog of a spirit

we housed you in a beautiful temple we gilded you prettily we fed you

well we brought you offerings and yet how ungrateful you are similar

displays of resentment have been made against pictures of the mother of

god and pictures of saints in catholic countries during the present

century when such pictures would not do their duty during times of

pestilence and drought
through all these magical relationships to nature countless ceremonies

are occasioned and finally when their complexity and confusion grow

too great pains are taken to systematize them to arrange them so that

the favorable course of natures progress namely the great148 yearly

circle of the seasons may be brought about by a corresponding course of

the ceremonial progress the aim of religious worship is to influence

nature to human advantage and hence to instil a subjection to law into

her that originally she has not whereas at present man desires to find

out the subjection to law of nature in order to guide himself thereby

in brief the system of religious worship rests upon the idea of magic

between man and man and the magician is older than the priest but it

rests equally upon other and higher ideas it brings into prominence the

sympathetic relation of man to man the existence of benevolence

gratitude prayer of truces between enemies of loans upon security of

arrangements for the protection of property man even in very inferior

degrees of civilization does not stand in the presence of nature as a

helpless slave he is not willynilly the absolute servant of nature in

the greek development of religion especially in the relationship to the

olympian gods it becomes possible to entertain the idea of an existence

side by side of two castes a higher more powerful and a lower less

powerful but both are bound together in some way on account of their

origin and are one species they need not be ashamed of one another

this is the element of distinction in greek religion149
112
at the contemplation of certain ancient sacrificial proceedingshow

many sentiments are lost to us is manifest in the union of the farcical

even of the obscene with the religious feeling the feeling that this

mixture is possible is becoming extinct we realize the mixture only

historically in the mysteries of demeter and dionysos and in the

christian easter festivals and religious mysteries but we still

perceive the sublime in connection with the ridiculous and the like

the emotional with the absurd perhaps a later age will be unable to

understand even these combinations
113
christianity as antiquitywhen on a sunday morning we hear the old

bells ringing we ask ourselves is it possible all this for a jew

crucified two thousand years ago who said he was gods son the proof of

such an assertion is lackingcertainly the christian religion

constitutes in our time a protruding bit of antiquity from very remote

ages and that its assertions are still generally believedalthough men

have become so keen in the scrutiny of claimsconstitutes the oldest

relic of this inheritance a god who begets children by a mortal150 woman

a sage who demands that no more work be done that no more justice be

administered but that the signs of the approaching end of the world be

heeded a system of justice that accepts an innocent as a vicarious

sacrifice in the place of the guilty a person who bids his disciples

drink his blood prayers for miracles sins against a god expiated upon

a god fear of a hereafter to which death is the portal the figure of

the cross as a symbol in an age that no longer knows the purpose and the

ignominy of the crosshow ghostly all these things flit before us out

of the grave of their primitive antiquity is one to believe that such

things can still be believed
114
the ungreek in christianitythe greeks did not look upon the homeric

gods above them as lords nor upon themselves beneath as servants after

the fashion of the jews they saw but the counterpart as in a mirror of

the most perfect specimens of their own caste hence an ideal but no

contradiction of their own nature there was a feeling of mutual

relationship resulting in a mutual interest a sort of alliance man

thinks well of himself when he gives himself such gods and places

himself in a151 relationship akin to that of the lower nobility with the

higher whereas the italian races have a decidedly vulgar religion

involving perpetual anxiety because of bad and mischievous powers and

soul disturbers wherever the olympian gods receded into the background

there even greek life became gloomier and more perturbedchristianity

on the other hand oppressed and degraded humanity completely and sank

it into deepest mire into the feeling of utter abasement it suddenly

flashed the gleam of divine compassion so that the amazed and

gracedazzled stupefied one gave a cry of delight and for a moment

believed that the whole of heaven was within him upon this unhealthy

excess of feeling upon the accompanying corruption of heart and head

christianity attains all its psychological effects it wants to

annihilate debase stupefy amaze bedazzle there is but one thing

that it does not want measure standard das maas and therefore is it

in the worst sense barbarous asiatic vulgar ungreek
115
being religious to some purposethere are certain insipid

trafficvirtuous people to whom religion is pinned like the hem of some

garb of a higher humanity these people do152 well to remain religious it

adorns them all who are not versed in some professional

weaponincluding tongue and pen as weaponsare servile to all such

the christian religion is very useful for then their servility assumes

the aspect of christian virtue and is amazingly adornedpeople whose

daily lives are empty and colorless are readily religious this is

comprehensible and pardonable but they have no right to demand that

others whose daily lives are not empty and colorless should be

religious also
116
the everyday christianif christianity with its allegations of an

avenging god universal sinfulness choice of grace and the danger of

eternal damnation were true it would be an indication of weakness of

mind and character not to be a priest or an apostle or a hermit and

toil for ones own salvation it would be irrational to lose sight of

ones eternal well being in comparison with temporary advantage

assuming these dogmas to be generally believed the every day christian

is a pitiable figure a man who really cannot count as far as three and

who for the rest just because of his intellectual incapacity does not

deserve to be as hard punished as christianity promises he shall be153
117
concerning the cleverness of christianityit is a master stroke of

christianity to so emphasize the unworthiness sinfulness and

degradation of men in general that contempt of ones fellow creatures

becomes impossible he may sin as much as he pleases he is not by

nature different from me it is i who in every way am unworthy and

contemptible so says the christian to himself but even this feeling

has lost its keenest sting for the christian does not believe in his

individual degradation he is bad in his general human capacity and he

soothes himself a little with the assertion that we are all alike
118
personal changeas soon as a religion rules it has for its opponents

fate of christianitychristianity arose to lighten the heart but now

it must first make the heart heavy in order to be able to lighten it

afterwards christianity will consequently go down154
120
the testimony of pleasurethe agreeable opinion is accepted as true

this is the testimony of pleasure or as the church says the evidence

of strength of which all religions are so proud although they should

all be ashamed of it if a belief did not make blessed it would not be

believed how little it would be worth then
121
dangerous playwhoever gives religious feeling room must then also

let it grow he can do nothing else then his being gradually changes

the religious element brings with it affinities and kinships the whole

circle of his judgment and feeling is clouded and draped in religious

shadows feeling cannot stand still one should be on ones guard
122
the blind pupilas long as one knows very well the strength and the

weakness of ones dogma ones art ones religion its strength is

still low the pupil and apostle who has no eye for the weaknesses of a

dogma a religion and so on dazzled by the aspect of the master and by

his own reverence for him has on that very155 account generally more

power than the master without blind pupils the influence of a man and

his work has never become great to give victory to knowledge often

amounts to no more than so allying it with stupidity that the brute

force of the latter forces triumph for the former
123
the breaking off of churchesthere is not sufficient religion in the

world merely to put an end to the number of religions
124
sinlessness of menif one have understood how sin came into the

world namely through errors of the reason through which men in their

intercourse with one another and even individual men looked upon

themselves as much blacker and wickeder than was really the case ones

whole feeling is much lightened and man and the world appear together in

such a halo of harmlessness that a sentiment of well being is instilled

into ones whole nature man in the midst of nature is as a child left

to its own devices this child indeed dreams a heavy anxious dream but

when it opens its eyes it finds itself always in paradise156
125
irreligiousness of artistshomer is so much at home among his gods and

is as a poet so good natured to them that he must have been profoundly

irreligious that which was brought to him by the popular faitha mean

crude and partially repulsive superstitionhe dealt with as freely as

the sculptor with his clay therefore with the same freedom that

schylus and aristophanes evinced and with which in later times the

great artists of the renaissance and also shakespeare and goethe drew

their pictures
126
art and strength of false interpretationall the visions fears

exhaustions and delights of the saint are well known symptoms of

sickness which in him owing to deep rooted religious and psychological

delusions are explained quite differently that is not as symptoms of

sicknessso too perhaps the demon of socrates was nothing but a

malady of the ear that he explained in view of his predominant moral

theory in a manner different from what would be thought rational

today nor is the case different with the frenzy and the frenzied

speeches of the prophets and of the priests of the oracles it is always

the degree of wisdom imagination157 capacity and morality in the heart

and mind of the interpreters that got so much out of them it is among

the greatest feats of the men who are called geniuses and saints that

they made interpreters for themselves who fortunately for mankind did

not understand them
127
reverence for madnessbecause it was perceived that an excitement of

some kind often made the head clearer and occasioned fortunate

inspirations it was concluded that the utmost excitement would occasion

the most fortunate inspirations hence the frenzied being was revered as

a sage and an oracle giver a false conclusion lies at the bottom of all

this
128
promises of wisdommodern science has as its object as little pain as

possible as long a life as possiblehence a sort of eternal

blessedness but of a very limited kind in comparison with the promises

of religion
129
forbidden generositythere is not enough of love and goodness in the

world to throw any of it away on conceited people158
130
survival of religious training in the dispositionthe catholic church

and before it all ancient education controlled the whole domain of

means through which man was put into certain unordinary moods and

withdrawn from the cold calculation of personal advantage and from calm

rational reflection a church vibrating with deep tones gloomy

regular restraining exhortations from a priestly band who

involuntarily communicate their own tension to their congregation and

lead them to listen almost with anxiety as if some miracle were in

course of preparation the awesome pile of architecture which as the

house of a god rears itself vastly into the vague and in all its

shadowy nooks inspires fear of its nerveexciting powerwho would care

to reduce men to the level of these things if the ideas upon which they

rest became extinct but the results of all these things are

nevertheless not thrown away the inner world of exalted emotional

prophetic profoundly repentant hopeblessed moods has become inborn in

man largely through cultivation what still exists in his soul was

formerly as he germinated grew and bloomed thoroughly disciplined
131
religious afterpainsthough one believe159 oneself absolutely weaned

away from religion the process has yet not been so thorough as to make

impossible a feeling of joy at the presence of religious feelings and

dispositions without intelligible content as for example in music

and if a philosophy alleges to us the validity of metaphysical hopes

through the peace of soul therein attainable and also speaks of the

whole true gospel in the look of raphaels madonna we greet such

declarations and innuendoes with a welcome smile the philosopher has

here a matter easy of demonstration he responds with that which he is

glad to give namely a heart that is glad to accept hence it is

observable how the less reflective free spirits collide only with dogmas

but yield readily to the magic of religious feelings it is a source of

pain to them to let the latter go simply on account of the

formerscientific philosophy must be very much on its guard lest on

account of this necessityan evolved and hence also a transitory

necessitydelusions are smuggled in even logicians speak of

presentiments of truth in ethics and in art for example of the

presentiment that the essence of things is unity a thing which

nevertheless ought to be prohibited between carefully deduced truths

and such foreboded things there lies the abysmal distinction that the

former are products of the intellect and the latter of the necessity160

hunger is no evidence that there is food at hand to appease it hunger

merely craves food presentiment does not denote that the existence of

a thing is known in any way whatever it denotes merely that it is

deemed possible to the extent that it is desired or feared the

presentiment is not one step forward in the domain of certaintyit

is involuntarily believed that the religious tinted sections of a

philosophy are better attested than the others but the case is at

bottom just the opposite there is simply the inner wish that it may be

so that the thing which beautifies may also be true this wish leads us

to accept bad grounds as good
132
of the christian need of salvationcareful consideration must render

it possible to propound some explanation of that process in the soul of

a christian which is termed need of salvation and to propound an

explanation too free from mythology hence one purely psychological

heretofore psychological explanations of religious conditions and

processes have really been in disrepute inasmuch as a theology calling

itself free gave vent to its unprofitable nature in this domain for its

principal aim so far as may be judged from the spirit of its creator

schleiermacher161 was the preservation of the christian religion and the

maintenance of the christian theology it appeared that in the

psychological analysis of religious facts a new anchorage and above

all a new calling were to be gained undisturbed by such predecessors

we venture the following exposition of the phenomena alluded to man is

conscious of certain acts which are very firmly implanted in the general

course of conduct indeed he discovers in himself a predisposition to

such acts that seems to him to be as unalterable as his very being how

gladly he would essay some other kind of acts which in the general

estimate of conduct are rated the best and highest how gladly he would

welcome the consciousness of well doing which ought to follow unselfish

motive unfortunately however it goes no further than this longing

the discontent consequent upon being unable to satisfy it is added to

all other kinds of discontent which result from his life destiny in

particular or which may be due to so called bad acts so that a deep

depression ensues accompanied by a desire for some physician to remove

it and all its causesthis condition would not be found so bitter if

the individual but compared himself freely with other men for then he

would have no reason to be discontented with himself in particular as he

is merely bearing his share of the162 general burden of human discontent

and incompleteness but he compares himself with a being who alone must

be capable of the conduct that is called unegoistic and of an enduring

consciousness of unselfish motive with god it is because he gazes into

this clear mirror that his own self seems so extraordinarily distracted

and so troubled thereupon the thought of that being in so far as it

flits before his fancy as retributive justice occasions him anxiety in

every conceivable small and great experience he believes he sees the

anger of the being his threats the very implements and manacles of his

judge and prison what succors him in this danger which in the

prospect of an eternal duration of punishment transcends in hideousness

all the horrors that can be presented to the imagination
133
before we consider this condition in its further effects we would admit

to ourselves that man is betrayed into this condition not through his

fault and sin but through a series of delusions of the reason that

it was the fault of the mirror if his own self appeared to him in the

highest degree dark and hateful and that that mirror was his own work

the very imperfect work of human imagination and judgment in163 the first

place a being capable of absolutely unegoistic conduct is as fabulous as

the phoenix such a being is not even thinkable for the very reason that

the whole notion of unegoistic conduct when closely examined

vanishes into air never yet has a man done anything solely for others

and entirely without reference to a personal motive indeed how could he

possibly do anything that had no reference to himself that is without

inward compulsion which must always have its basis in a personal need

how could the ego act without egoa god who on the other hand is

all love as he is usually represented would not be capable of a

solitary unegoistic act whence one is reminded of a reflection of

lichtenbergs which is in truth taken from a lower sphere we cannot

possibly feel for others as the expression goes we feel only for

ourselves the assertion sounds hard but it is not if rightly

understood a man loves neither his father nor his mother nor his wife

nor his child but simply the feelings which they inspire or as la

rochefoucauld says if you think you love your mistress for the mere

love of her you are very much mistaken why acts of love are more

highly prized than others namely not on account of their nature but on

account of their utility has already been explained in the section on

the origin of moral feelings but164 if a man should wish to be all love

like the god aforesaid and want to do all things for others and nothing

for himself the procedure would be fundamentally impossible because he

must do a great deal for himself before there would be any possibility

of doing anything for the love of others it is also essential that

others be sufficiently egoistic to accept always and at all times this

self sacrifice and living for others so that the men of love and self

sacrifice have an interest in the survival of unloving and selfish

egoists while the highest morality in order to maintain itself must

formally enforce the existence of immorality wherein it would be really

destroying itselffurther the idea of a god perturbs and discourages

as long as it is accepted but as to how it originated can no longer in

the present state of comparative ethnological science be a matter of

doubt and with the insight into the origin of this belief all faith

collapses what happens to the christian who compares his nature with

that of god is exactly what happened to don quixote who depreciated his

own prowess because his head was filled with the wondrous deeds of the

heroes of chivalrous romance the standard of measurement which both

employ belongs to the domain of fablebut if the idea of god

collapses so too does the feeling of sin as a violation of divine

rescript as a stain upon a165 godlike creation there still apparently

remains that discouragement which is closely allied with fear of the

punishment of worldly justice or of the contempt of ones fellow men

the keenest thorn in the sentiment of sin is dulled when it is perceived

that ones acts have contravened human tradition human rules and human

laws without having thereby endangered the eternal salvation of the

soul and its relations with deity if finally men attain to the

conviction of the absolute necessity of all acts and of their utter

irresponsibility and then absorb it into their flesh and blood every

relic of conscience pangs will disappear
134
if now as stated the christian through certain delusive feelings is

betrayed into self contempt that is by a false and unscientific view of

his acts and feelings he must nevertheless perceive with the utmost

amazement that this state of self contempt of conscience pangs of

despair in particular does not last that there are hours during which

all these things are wafted away from the soul and he feels himself once

more free and courageous the truth is that joy in his own being the

fulness of his own powers in connection with the inevitable decline of

his profound166 excitation with the lapse of time bore off the palm of

victory the man loves himself once more he feels itbut this very new

love this new self esteem seems to him incredible he can see in it

only the wholly unmerited stream of the light of grace shed down upon

him if he formerly saw in every event merely warnings threats

punishments and every kind of indication of divine anger he now reads

into his experiences the grace of god the latter circumstance seems to

him full of love the former as a helpful pointing of the way and his

entirely joyful frame of mind now seems to him to be an absolute proof

of the goodness of god as formerly in his states of discouragement he

interpreted his conduct falsely so now he does the same with his

experiences his state of consolation is now regarded as the effect

produced by some external power the love with which at bottom he

loves himself seems to be the divine love that which he calls grace

and the preliminary of salvation is in reality selfgrace

selfsalvation
135
therefore a certain false psychology a certain kind of imaginativeness

in the interpretation of motives and experiences is the essential

preliminary167 to being a christian and to experiencing the need of

salvation upon gaining an insight into this wandering of the reason and

the imagination one ceases to be a christian
136
of christian asceticism and sanctitymuch as some thinkers have

exerted themselves to impart an air of the miraculous to those singular

phenomena known as asceticism and sanctity to question which or to

account for which upon a rational basis would be wickedness and

sacrilege the temptation to this wickedness is none the less great a

powerful impulse of nature has in every age led to protest against such

phenomena at any rate science inasmuch as it is the imitation of

nature permits the casting of doubts upon the inexplicable character

and the supernal degree of such phenomena it is true that heretofore

science has not succeeded in its attempts at explanation the phenomena

remain unexplained still to the great satisfaction of those who revere

moral miracles for speaking generally the unexplained must rank as

the inexplicable the inexplicable as the nonnatural supernatural

miraculousso runs the demand in the souls of all the religious and all

the metaphysicians even the artists if they happen to be168 thinkers

whereas the scientific man sees in this demand the evil

principlethe universal first apparent truth that is encountered in

the contemplation of sanctity and asceticism is that their nature is

complicated for nearly always within the physical world as well as in

the moral the apparently miraculous may be traced successfully to the

complex the obscure the multiconditioned let us venture then to

isolate a few impulses in the soul of the saint and the ascetic to

consider them separately and then view them as a synthetic development
137
there is an obstinacy against oneself certain sublimated forms of which

are included in asceticism certain kinds of men are under such a strong

necessity of exercising their power and dominating impulses that if

other objects are lacking or if they have not succeeded with other

objects they will actually tyrannize over some portions of their own

nature or over sections and stages of their own personality thus do

many thinkers bring themselves to views which are far from likely to

increase or improve their fame many deliberately bring down the

contempt of others upon themselves although they could easily have

retained consideration by169 silence others contradict earlier opinions

and do not shrink from the ordeal of being deemed inconsistent on the

contrary they strive for this and act like eager riders who enjoy

horseback exercise most when the horse is skittish thus will men in

dangerous paths ascend to the highest steeps in order to laugh to scorn

their own fear and their own trembling limbs thus will the philosopher

embrace the dogmas of asceticism humility sanctity in the light of

which his own image appears in its most hideous aspect this crushing of

self this mockery of ones own nature this spernere se sperni out of

which religions have made so much is in reality but a very high

development of vanity the whole ethic of the sermon on the mount

belongs in this category man has a true delight in mastering himself

through exaggerated pretensions or excessive expedients and later

deifying this tyrannically exacting something within him in every

scheme of ascetic ethics man prays to one part of himself as if it were

god and hence it is necessary for him to treat the rest of himself as

devil
138
man is not at all hours equally moral this is established if ones

morality be judged according to ones capacity for great self

sacrificing170 resolutions and abnegations which when continual and made

a habit are known as sanctity one is in affection or disposition the

most moral while higher excitement supplies wholly new impulses which

were one calm and cool as ordinarily one would not deem oneself even

capable of how comes this apparently from the propinquity of all great

and lofty emotional states if a man is brought to an extraordinary

pitch of feeling he can resolve upon a fearful revenge or upon a fearful

renunciation of his thirst for vengeance indifferently he craves under

the influences of powerful emotion the great the powerful the

immense and if he chances to perceive that the sacrifice of himself

will afford him as much satisfaction as the sacrifice of another or

will afford him more he will choose self sacrifice what concerns him

particularly is simply the unloading of his emotion hence he readily

to relieve his tension grasps the darts of the enemy and buries them in

his own breast that in self abnegation and not in revenge the element

of greatness consisted must have been brought home to mankind only after

long habituation a god who sacrifices himself would be the most

powerful and most effective symbol of this sort of greatness as the

conquest of the most hardly conquered enemy the sudden mastering of a

passionthus does171 such abnegation appear hence it passes for the

summit of morality in reality all that is involved is the exchange of

one idea for another whilst the temperament remained at a like altitude

a like tidal state men when coming out of the spell or resting from

such passionate excitation no longer understand the morality of such

instants but the admiration of all who participated in the occasion

sustains them pride is their support if the passion and the

comprehension of their act weaken therefore at bottom even such acts

of selfabnegation are not moral inasmuch as they are not done with a

strict regard for others rather do others afford the high strung

temperament an opportunity to lighten itself through such abnegation
139
even the ascetic seeks to make life easier and generally by means of

absolute subjection to another will or to an all inclusive rule and

ritual pretty much as the brahmin leaves absolutely nothing to his own

volition but is guided in every moment of his life by some holy

injunction or other this subjection is a potent means of acquiring

dominion over oneself one is occupied hence time does not bang heavy

and there is no incitement of the personal will and of the individual172

passion the deed once done there is no feeling of responsibility nor

the sting of regret one has given up ones own will once for all and

this is easier than to give it up occasionally as it is also easier

wholly to renounce a desire than to yield to it in measured degree when

we consider the present relation of man to the state we perceive

unconditional obedience is easier than conditional the holy person also

makes his lot easier through the complete surrender of his life

personality and it is all delusion to admire such a phenomenon as the

loftiest heroism of morality it is always more difficult to assert

ones personality without shrinking and without hesitation than to give

it up altogether in the manner indicated and it requires moreover more

intellect and thought
140
after having discovered in many of the less comprehensible actions mere

manifestations of pleasure in emotion for its own sake i fancy i can

detect in the self contempt which characterises holy persons and also

in their acts of self torture through hunger and scourgings

distortions and chaining of the limbs acts of madness simply a means

whereby such natures may resist the general exhaustion of their will to

live their173 nerves they employ the most painful expedients to escape

if only for a time from the heaviness and weariness in which they are

steeped by their great mental indolence and their subjection to a will

other than their own
141
the most usual means by which the ascetic and the sanctified individual

seeks to make life more endurable comprises certain combats of an inner

nature involving alternations of victory and prostration for this

purpose an enemy is necessary and he is found in the so called inner

enemy that is the holy individual makes use of his tendency to

vanity domineering and pride and of his mental longings in order to

contemplate his life as a sort of continuous battle and himself as a

battlefield in which good and evil spirits wage war with varying

fortune it is an established fact that the imagination is restrained

through the regularity and adequacy of sexual intercourse while on the

other hand abstention from or great irregularity in sexual intercourse

will cause the imagination to run riot the imaginations of many of the

christian saints were obscene to a degree and because of the theory

that sexual desires were in reality demons that raged within them the

saints did not feel wholly174 responsible for them it is to this

conviction that we are indebted for the highly instructive sincerity of

their evidence against themselves it was to their interest that this

contest should always be kept up in some fashion because by means of

this contest as already stated their empty lives gained distraction

in order that the contest might seem sufficiently great to inspire

sympathy and admiration in the unsanctified it was essential that

sexual capacity be ever more and more damned and denounced indeed the

danger of eternal damnation was so closely allied to this capacity that

for whole generations christians showed their children with actual

conscience pangs what evil may not have been done to humanity through

this and yet here the truth is just upside down an exceedingly

unseemly attitude for the truth christianity it is true had said that

every man is conceived and born in sin and in the intolerable and

excessive christianity of calderon this thought is again perverted and

entangled into the most distorted paradox extant in the well known lines

the greatest sin of man
is the sin of being born

in all pessimistic religions the act of procreation is looked upon as

evil in itself this is far from being the general human opinion it is

not even the opinion of all pessimists empedocles175 for example knows

nothing of anything shameful devilish and sinful in it he sees rather

in the great field of bliss of unholiness simply a healthful and hopeful

phenomenon aphrodite she is to him an evidence that strife does not

always rage but that some time a gentle demon is to wield the sceptre

the christian pessimists of practice had as stated a direct interest

in the prevalence of an opposite belief they needed in the loneliness

and the spiritual wilderness of their lives an ever living enemy and a

universally known enemy through whose conquest they might appear to the

unsanctified as utterly incomprehensible and half unnatural beings when

this enemy at last as a result of their mode of life and their

shattered health took flight forever they were able immediately to

people their inner selves with new demons the rise and fall of the

balance of cheerfulness and despair maintained their addled brains in a

totally new fluctuation of longing and peace of soul and in that period

psychology served not only to cast suspicion on everything human but to

wound and scourge it to crucify it man wanted to find himself as base

and evil as possible man sought to become anxious about the state of

his soul he wished to be doubtful of his own capacity everything

natural with which man connects the idea of badness and sinfulness as

for instance176 is still customary in regard to the erotic injures and

degrades the imagination occasions a shamed aspect leads man to war

upon himself and makes him uncertain distrustful of himself even his

dreams acquire a tincture of the unclean conscience and yet this

suffering because of the natural element in certain things is wholly

superfluous it is simply the result of opinions regarding the things

it is easy to understand why men become worse than they are if they are

brought to look upon the unavoidably natural as bad and later to feel it

as of evil origin it is the master stroke of religions and metaphysics

that wish to make man out bad and sinful by nature to render nature

suspicious in his eyes and to so make himself evil for he learns to

feel himself evil when he cannot divest himself of nature he gradually

comes to look upon himself after a long life lived naturally so

oppressed by a weight of sin that supernatural powers become necessary

to relieve him of the burden and with this notion comes the so called

need of salvation which is the result not of a real but of an imaginary

sinfulness go through the separate moral expositions in the vouchers of

christianity and it will always be found that the demands are excessive

in order that it may be impossible for man to satisfy them the object

is not that he may become moral but that he may feel as sinful177 as

possible if this feeling had not been rendered agreeable to manwhy

should he have improvised such an ideal and clung to it so long as in

the ancient world an incalculable strength of intellect and capacity for

feeling was squandered in order to increase the joy of living through

feastful systems of worship so in the era of christianity an equally

incalculable quantity of intellectual capacity has been sacrificed in

another endeavor that man should in every way feel himself sinful and

thereby be moved inspired inspirited to move to inspire to inspirit

at any costis not this the freedom cry of an exhausted overripe

over cultivated age the circle of all the natural sensations had been

gone through a hundred times the soul had grown weary then the saints

and the ascetics found a new order of ecstacies they set themselves

before the eyes of all not alone as models for imitation to many but as

fearful and yet delightful spectacles on the boundary line between this

world and the next world where in that period everyone thought he saw

at one time rays of heavenly light at another fearful threatening

tongues of flame the eye of the saint directed upon the fearful

significance of the shortness of earthly life upon the imminence of the

last judgment upon eternal life hereafter this glowering eye in an

emaciated body caused men in178 the old time world to tremble to the

depths of their being to look to look away and shudder to feel anew

the fascination of the spectacle to yield to it sate oneself upon it

until the soul trembled with ardor and feverthat was the last pleasure

left to classical antiquity when its sensibilities had been blunted by

the arena and the gladiatorial show
142
to sum up all that has been said that condition of soul at which the

saint or expectant saint is rejoiced is a combination of elements which

we are all familiar with except that under other influences than those

of mere religious ideation they customarily arouse the censure of men in

the same way that when combined with religion itself and regarded as the

supreme attainment of sanctity they are object of admiration and even

of prayerat least in more simple times very soon the saint turns upon

himself that severity that is so closely allied to the instinct of

domination at any price and which inspire even in the most solitary

individual the sense of power soon his swollen sensitiveness of feeling

breaks forth from the longing to restrain his passions within it and is

transformed179 into a longing to master them as if they were wild steeds

the master impulse being ever that of a proud spirit next he craves a

complete cessation of all perturbing fascinating feelings a waking

sleep an enduring repose in the lap of a dull animal plantlike

indolence next he seeks the battle and extinguishes it within himself

because weariness and boredom confront him he binds his

selfdeification with selfcontempt he delights in the wild tumult of

his desires and the sharp pain of sin in the very idea of being lost

he is able to play his very passions for instance the desire to

domineer a trick so that he goes to the other extreme of abject

humiliation and subjection so that his overwrought soul is without any

restraint through this antithesis and finally when indulgence in

visions in talks with the dead or with divine beings overcomes him

this is really but a form of gratification that he craves perhaps a

form of gratification in which all other gratifications are blended

novalis one of the authorities in matters of sanctity because of his

experience and instinct betrays the whole secret with the utmost

simplicity when he says it is remarkable that the close connection of

gratification religion and cruelty has not long ago made men aware of

their inner relationship and common tendency180
143
not what the saint is but what he was in the eyes of the nonsanctified

gives him his historical importance because there existed a delusion

respecting the saint his soul states being falsely viewed and his

personality being sundered as much as possible from humanity as a

something incomparable and supernatural because of these things he

attained the extraordinary with which he swayed the imaginations of

whole nations and whole ages even he knew himself not for even he

regarded his dispositions passions and actions in accordance with a

system of interpretation as artificial and exaggerated as the pneumatic

interpretation of the bible the distorted and diseased in his own

nature with its blending of spiritual poverty defective knowledge

ruined health overwrought nerves remained as hidden from his view as

from the view of his beholders he was neither a particularly good man

nor a particularly bad man but he stood for something that was far above

the human standard in wisdom and goodness faith in him sustained faith

in the divine and miraculous in a religious significance of all

existence in an impending day of judgment in the last rays of the

setting sun of the ancient world which fell upon the christian peoples

the shadowy181 form of the saint attained enormous proportionsto such

enormous proportions indeed that down even to our own age which no

longer believes in god there are thinkers who believe in the saints
144
it stands to reason that this sketch of the saint made upon the model

of the whole species can be confronted with many opposing sketches that

would create a more agreeable impression there are certain exceptions

among the species who distinguish themselves either by especial

gentleness or especial humanity and perhaps by the strength of their

own personality others are in the highest degree fascinating because

certain of their delusions shed a particular glow over their whole

being as is the case with the founder of christianity who took himself

for the only begotten son of god and hence felt himself sinless so that

through his imaginationthat should not be too harshly judged since the

whole of antiquity swarmed with sons of godhe attained the same goal

the sense of complete sinlessness complete irresponsibility that can

now be attained by every individual through sciencein the same manner

i have viewed the saints of india who occupy an intermediate station

between182 the christian saints and the greek philosophers and hence are

not to be regarded as a pure type knowledge and scienceas far as they

existedand superiority to the rest of mankind by logical discipline

and training of the intellectual powers were insisted upon by the

buddhists as essential to sanctity just as they were denounced by the

christian world as the indications of sinfulness

 translators preface
the twilight of the idols was written towards the end of the summer

of 1888 its composition seems to have occupied only a few daysso

few indeed that in ecce homo p 118 nietzsche says he hesitates

to give their number but in any case we know it was completed on the

3rd of september in sils maria the manuscript which was dispatched to

the printers on the 7th of september bore the title idle hours of a

psychologist this however was abandoned in favour of the present

title while the work was going through the press during september

and the early part of october 1888 nietzsche added to the original

contents of the book by inserting the whole section entitled things

the germans lack and aphorisms 3243 of skirmishes in a war with the

age and the book as it now stands represents exactly the form in

which nietzsche intended to publish it in the course of the year 1889

unfortunately its author was already stricken down with illness when

the work first appeared at the end of january 1889 and he was denied

the joy of seeing it run into nine editions of one thousand each

before his death in 1900
of the twilight of the idols nietzsche says in ecce homo p

118if anyone should desire to obtain a rapid sketch of how

everything before mypg viii time was standing on its head he should begin

reading me in this book that which is called idols on the titlepage

is simply the old truth that has been believed in hitherto in plain

english the twilight of the idols means that the old truth is on its

last legs
certain it is that for a rapid survey of the whole of nietzsches

doctrine no book save perhaps the section entitled of old and new

tables in thus spake zarathustra could be of more real value than

the twilight of the idols here nietzsche is quite at his best he

is ripe for the marvellous feat of the transvaluation of all values

nowhere is his languagethat marvellous weapon which in his hand

became at once so supple and so murderousmore forcible and more

condensed nowhere are his thoughts more profound but all this does

not by any means imply that this book is the easiest of nietzsches

works on the contrary i very much fear that unless the reader is

well prepared not only in nietzscheism but also in the habit of

grappling with uncommon and elusive problems a good deal of the

contents of this work will tend rather to confuse than to enlighten

him in regard to what nietzsche actually wishes to make clear in these

pages
how much prejudice for instance how many traditional and deepseated

opinions must be uprooted if we are to see even so much as an

important note of interrogation in the section entitled the problem

of socratesnot to speak of such sections as morality as the enemy

of nature the four great errors c the errors exposed in thesepg ix

sections have a tradition of two thousand years behind them and only a

fantastic dreamer could expect them to be eradicated by a mere casual

study of these pages indeed nietzsche himself looked forward only to

a gradual change in the general view of the questions he discussed he

knew only too well what the conversion of light heads was worth and

what kind of man would probably be the first to rush into his arms

and grand psychologist that he was he guarded himself beforehand

against bad company by means of his famous warningthe first

adherents of a creed do not prove anything against it
to the aspiring student of nietzsche however it ought not to be

necessary to become an immediate convert in order to be interested in

the treasure of thought which nietzsche here lavishes upon us for

such a man it will be quite difficult enough to regard the questions

raised in this work as actual problems once however he has succeeded

in doing this and has given his imagination time to play round these

questions as problems the particular turn or twist that nietzsche

gives to their elucidation may then perhaps strike him not only as

valuable but as absolutely necessary
with regard to the substance of the twilight of the idols nietzsche

says in ecce homo p 119there is the waste of an alltoorich

autumn in this book you trip over truths you even crush some to

death there are too many of them
and what are these truths they are things that are not yet held to

be true they are the utterances of a man who as a single exception

escaped for apg x while the general insanity of europe with its blind

idealism in the midst of squalor with its unscrupulous praise of

socalled progress while it stood kneedeep in the belittlement

of man and with its vulgar levity in the face of effeminacy and

decaythey are the utterances of one who voiced the hopes the

aims and the realities of another world not of an ideal world not

of a world beyond but of a real world of this world regenerated

and reorganised upon a sounder a more virile and a more orderly

basisin fact of a perfectly possible world one that has already

existed in the past and could exist again if only the stupendous

revolution of a transvaluation of all values were made possible
this then is the nature of the truths uttered by this one sane man in

the whole of europe at the end of last century and when owing to his

unequal struggle against the overwhelming hostile forces of his time

his highly sensitive personality was at last forced to surrender itself

to the enemy and become one with themthat is to say insaneat

least the record of his sanity had been safely stored away beyond the

reach of time and change in the volumes which constitute his lifework

nietzsche must have started upon the antichrist immediately after

having dispatched the idle hours of a psychologist to the printers

and the work appears to have been finished at the end of september

1888 it was intended by nietzsche to form the first book of a large

work entitled the transvaluation of all values but though this work

was never completed we can form some ideapg xi from the substance of the

antichrist and from the titles of the remaining three books which

alas were never written of what its contents would have been these

titles arebook ii the free spirit a criticism of philosophy as a

nihilistic movement book iii the immoralist a criticism of the most

fatal kind of ignorancemorality book iv dionysus the philosophy

of eternal recurrence
nietzsche calls this book an attempted criticism of christianity

modest as this subtitle is it will probably seem not quite modest

enough to those who think that nietzsche fell far short of doing

justice to their holy creed be this as it may there is the solution

of a certain profound problem in this book which while it is the key

to all nietzscheism is also the justification and the sanctification

of nietzsches cause the problem stated quite plainly is this to

what end did christianity avail itself of falsehood
many readers of this amazing little work who happen to be acquainted

with nietzsches doctrine of art and of ruling will probably feel

slightly confused at the constant deprecation of falsehood of

deception and of arbitrary makebelieve which seems to run through

this book like a litany in praise of a certain absolute truth
remembering nietzsches utterance in volume ii p 26 of the will

to power to witthe prerequisite of all living things and of

their lives is that there should be a large amount of faith that

it should be possible to pass definite judgments on things and

that there should be no doubt at allpg xii concerning values thus it is

necessary that something should be assumed to be true not that it

is trueremembering these words as i say the reader may stand

somewhat aghast before all those passages in the second half of this

volume where the very falsehoods of christianity its assumptions its

unwarrantable claims to truth are declared to be pernicious base and

corrupt
again and again if we commit the error of supposing that nietzsche

believed in a truth that was absolute we shall find throughout his

works reasons for charging him with apparently the very same crimes

that he here lays at the door of christianity what then is the

explanation of his seeming inconsistency
it is simple enough nietzsches charge of falsehood against

christianity is not a moral onein fact it may be taken as a general

rule that nietzsche scrupulously avoids making moral charges and that

he emains throughout faithful to his position beyond good and evil

see for instance aph 6antichrist where he repudiates all moral

prejudice in charging humanity with corruption a man who maintained

that truth is that form of error which enables a particular species to

prevail could not make a moral charge of falsehood against any one

or any institution but he could do so from another standpoint he could

well say for instance falsehood is that kind of error which causes a

particular species to degenerate and to decay
thus the fact that christianity lied becomes a subject of alarm

to nietzsche not owing to the fact that it is immoral to lie but

because in this particularpg xiii instance the lie was harmful hostile to

life and dangerous to humanity for a belief might be false and yet

lifepreserving beyond good and evil pp 8 9
suppose therefore we say with nietzsche that there is no absolute

truth but that all that has been true in the past which has been

the means of making the plant man flourish bestor since the

meaning of best is open to some debate let us say flourish in a

nietzschean sense that is to say thanks to a mastery of life and

to a preponderance of all those qualities which say yea to existence

and which suggest no flight from this world and all its pleasure and

pain and suppose we add that wherever we may find the plant man

flourishing in this sense we should there suspect the existence of

truthi if we say this with nietzsche any sort of assumption or

arbitrary valuation which aims at a reverse order of things becomes a

dangerous lie in a supermoral and purely physiological sense
with these preparatory remarks we are now prepared to read

aphorism 56 with a complete understanding of what nietzsche means and

to recognise in this particular aphorism the key to the whole of

nietzsches attitude towards christianity it is at once a solution of

our problem and a justification of its authors position naturally

it still remains open to nietzsches opponents to argue if they

choose that man has flourished best under the sway of nihilistic

religionsreligions which deny lifeand that consequently the

falsehoods of christianity are not only warrantable but also in the

highest degree blessed but in any case the aphorism inpg xiv question

completely exonerates nietzsche from a charge of inconsistency in the

use of the terms truth and falsehood throughout his works and

it moreover settles once and for all the exact altitude from which

our author looked down upon the religions of the world not only to

criticise them but also to place them in the order of their merit as

disciplinary systems aiming at the cultivation of particular types of

men
nietzsche says in aphorism 56after all the question is to what

end are falsehoods perpetrated the fact that in christianity holy

ends are entirely absent constitutes my objection to the means it

employs its ends are only bad ends the poisoning the calumniation

and the denial of life the contempt of the body the degradation and

selfpollution of man by virtue of the concept sinconsequently its

means are bad as well
thus to repeat it once more it is not because christianity availed

itself of all kinds of lies that nietzsche condemns it for the book

of manuwhich he admiresis just as full of falsehood as the semitic

book of laws but in the book of manu the lies are calculated to

preserve and to create a strong and noble type of man whereas in

christianity the opposite type was the aiman aim which has been

achieved in a manner far exceeding even the expectations of the

faithful
this then is the main argument of the book and its conclusion but in

the course of the general elaboration of this argument many important

sideissues are touched upon and developed wherein nietzsche reveals

himself as something very muchpg xv more valuable than a mere iconoclast

of course on every page of his philosophywhatever his enemies may

maintain to the contraryhe never once ceases to construct since he

is incessantly enumerating and emphasising those qualities and types

which he fain would rear as against those he fain would see destroyed

but it is in aphorism 57 of this book that nietzsche makes the

plainest and most complete statement of his actual taste in sociology

and it is upon this aphorism that all his followers and disciples will

ultimately have to build if nietzscheism is ever to become something

more than a merely intellectual movement

 preface
to maintain a cheerful attitude of mind in the midst of a gloomy and

exceedingly responsible task is no slight artistic feat and yet what

could be more necessary than cheerfulness nothing ever succeeds which

exuberant spirits have not helped to produce surplus power alone

is the proof of powera transvaluation of all valuesthis note

of interrogation which is so black so huge that it casts a shadow

even upon him who affixes itis a task of such fatal import that

he who undertakes it is compelled every now and then to rush out into

the sunlight in order to shake himself free from an earnestness that

becomes crushing far too crushing this end justifies every means

every event on the road to it is a windfall above all war war has

always been the great policy of all spirits who have penetrated too

far into themselves or who have grown too deep a wound stimulates the

recuperative powers for many years a maxim the origin of which i

withhold from learned curiosity has been my motto

increscunt animi virescit volnere virtus

at other times another means of recovery which is even more to my

taste is to crossexamine idols there are more idols than realities

in the worldpg xviii this constitutes my evil eye for this world it is

also my evil ear to put questions in this quarter with a hammer and

to hear perchance that wellknown hollow sound which tells of blownout

frogswhat a joy this is for one who has ears even behind his ears

for an old psychologist and pied piper like myself in whose presence

precisely that which would fain be silent must betray itself
even this treatiseas its title showsis above all a recreation

a ray of sunshine a leap sideways of a psychologist in his leisure

moments maybe too a new war and are we again crossexamining new

idols this little work is a great declaration of war and with regard

to the crossexamining of idols this time it is not the idols of the

age but eternal idols which are here struck with a hammer as with

a tuning forkthere are certainly no idols which are older more

convinced and more inflated neither are there any more hollow this

does not alter the fact that they are believed in more than any others

besides they are never called idolsat least not the most exalted

among their number

 the problem of socrates
1
in all ages the wisest have always agreed in their judgment of

life it is no good at all times and places the same words have

been on their lipswords full of doubt full of melancholy full of

weariness of life full of hostility to life even socrates dying

words wereto livemeans to be ill a long while i owe a cock to

the god sculapius even socrates had had enough of it what does that

prove what does it point to formerly people would have said oh

it has been said and loudly enough too by our pessimists loudest of

all in any case there must be some truth in this the consensus

sapientium is a proof of truthshall we say the same today may

we do so in any case there must be some sickness here we make

reply these great sages of all periods should first be examined more

closely is it possible that they were everyone of them a little

shaky on their legs effete rocky decadent does wisdom perhaps

appear on earth after the manner of a crow attracted by a slight smell

of carrion
2
this irreverent belief that the great sages were decadent types first

occurred to me precisely in regard to that case concerning which both

learnedpg 10 and vulgar prejudice was most opposed to my view i recognised

socrates and plato as symptoms of decline as instruments in the

disintegration of hellas as pseudogreek as antigreek the birth

of tragedy 1872 that consensus sapientium as i perceived ever

more and more clearly did not in the least prove that they were right

in the matter on which they agreed it proved rather that these sages

themselves must have been alike in some physiological particular in

order to assume the same negative attitude towards lifein order to

be bound to assume that attitude after all judgments and valuations

of life whether for or against cannot be true their only value lies

in the fact that they are symptoms they can be considered only as

symptomsper se such judgments are nonsense you must therefore

endeavour by all means to reach out and try to grasp this astonishingly

subtle axiom that the value of life cannot be estimated a living

man cannot do so because he is a contending party or rather the very

object in the dispute and not a judge nor can a dead man estimate

itfor other reasons for a philosopher to see a problem in the value

of life is almost an objection against him a note of interrogation

set against his wisdoma lack of wisdom what is it possible that all

these great sages were not only decadents but that they were not even

wise let me however return to the problem of socrates
3
to judge from his origin socrates belonged to the lowest of the low

socrates was mob you know and you can still see it for yourself

how uglypg 11 he was but ugliness which in itself is an objection was

almost a refutation among the greeks was socrates really a greek

ugliness is not infrequently the expression of thwarted development

or of development arrested by crossing in other cases it appears

as a decadent development the anthropologists among the criminal

specialists declare that i the typical criminal is ugly monstrum

in fronte monstrum in animo but the criminal is a decadent1

was socrates a typical criminalat all events this would not clash

with that famous physiognomists judgment which was so repugnant to

socrates friends while on his way through athens a certain foreigner

who was no fool at judging by looks told socrates to his face that

he was a monster that his body harboured all the worst vices and

passions and socrates replied simply you know me sir
4
not only are the acknowledged wildness and anarchy of socrates

instincts indicative of decadence but also that preponderance of the

logical faculties and that malignity of the misshapen which was his

special characteristic neither should we forget those aural delusions

which were religiously interpreted as the demon of socrates

everything in him is exaggerated buffo caricature his nature is

also full of concealment of ulterior motives andpg 12 of underground

currents i try to understand the idiosyncrasy from which the socratic

equationreason  virtue  happiness could have arisen the

weirdest equation ever seen and one which was essentially opposed to

all the instincts of the older hellenes
5
with socrates greek taste veers round in favour of dialectics what

actually occurs in the first place a noble taste is vanquished

with dialectics the mob comes to the top before socrates time

dialectical manners were avoided in good society they were regarded

as bad manners they were compromising young men were cautioned

against them all such proffering of ones reasons was looked upon with

suspicion honest things like honest men do not carry their reasons

on their sleeve in such fashion it is not good form to make a show

of everything that which needs to be proved cannot be worth much

wherever authority still belongs to good usage wherever men do not

prove but command the dialectician is regarded as a sort of clown

people laugh at him they do not take him seriously socrates was a

clown who succeeded in making men take him seriously what then was the

matter
6
a man resorts to dialectics only when he has no other means to hand

people know that they excite suspicion with it and that it is not

very convincing nothing is more easily dispelled than a dialectical

effect this is proved by the experience of everypg 13 gathering in which

discussions are held it can be only the last defence of those who have

no other weapons one must require to extort ones right otherwise one

makes no use of it that is why the jews were dialecticians reynard

the fox was a dialectician whatand was socrates one as well
7
is the socratic irony an expression of revolt of mob resentment

does socrates as a creature suffering under oppression enjoy his

innate ferocity in the knifethrusts of the syllogism does he wreak

his revenge on the noblemen he fascinatesas a dialectician a man

has a merciless instrument to wield he can play the tyrant with it

he compromises when he conquers with it the dialectician leaves it to

his opponent to prove that he is no idiot he infuriates he likewise

paralyses the dialectician cripples the intellect of his opponent can

it be that dialectics was only a form of revenge in socrates
8
i have given you to understand in what way socrates was able to repel

now it is all the more necessary to explain how he fascinatedone

reason is that he discovered a new kind of agon and that he was the

first fencingmaster in the best circles in athens he fascinated by

appealing to the combative instinct of the greekshe introduced a

variation into the contests between men and youths socrates was also a

great erotic
pg 14
9
but socrates divined still more he saw right through his noble

athenians he perceived that his case his peculiar case was no

exception even in his time the same kind of degeneracy was silently

preparing itself everywhere ancient athens was dying out and socrates

understood that the whole world needed himhis means his remedy his

special artifice for selfpreservation everywhere the instincts were

in a state of anarchy everywhere people were within an ace of excess

the monstrum in animo was the general danger the instincts would

play the tyrant we must discover a countertyrant who is stronger than

they on the occasion when that physiognomist had unmasked socrates

and had told him what he was a crater full of evil desires the great

master of irony let fall one or two words more which provide the key

to his nature this is true he said but i overcame them all how

did socrates succeed in mastering himself his case was at bottom only

the extreme and most apparent example of a state of distress which

was beginning to be general that state in which no one was able to

master himself and in which the instincts turned one against the other

as the extreme example of this state he fascinatedhis terrifying

ugliness made him conspicuous to every eye it is quite obvious that he

fascinated still more as a reply as a solution as an apparent cure of

this case
10
when a man finds it necessary as socrates did to create a tyrant out

of reason there is no smallpg 15 danger that something else wishes to play

the tyrant reason was then discovered as a saviour neither socrates

nor his patients were at liberty to be rational or not as they

pleased at that time it was de rigueur it had become a last shift

the fanaticism with which the whole of greek thought plunges into

reason betrays a critical condition of things men were in danger

there were only two alternatives either perish or else be absurdly

rational the moral bias of greek philosophy from plato onward is the

outcome of a pathological condition as is also its appreciation of

dialectics reason  virtue  happiness simply means we must imitate

socrates and confront the dark passions permanently with the light

of daythe light of reason we must at all costs be clever precise

clear all yielding to the instincts to the unconscious leads

downwards
11
i have now explained how socrates fascinated he seemed to be a

doctor a saviour is it necessary to expose the errors which lay in

his faith in reason at any priceit is a piece of selfdeception

on the part of philosophers and moralists to suppose that they can

extricate themselves from degeneration by merely waging war upon it

they cannot thus extricate themselves that which they choose as a

means as the road to salvation is in itself again only an expression

of degenerationthey only modify its mode of manifesting itself

they do not abolish it socrates was a misunderstanding the whole

of the morality of ameliorationthat of christianity as wellwas

a misunderstanding the most blinding lightpg 16 of day reason at any

price life made clear cold cautious conscious without instincts

opposed to the instincts was in itself only a disease another kind

of diseaseand by no means a return to virtue to health and to

happiness to be obliged to fight the instinctsthis is the formula of

degeneration as long as life is in the ascending line happiness is

the same as instinct
12
did he understand this himself this most intelligent of

selfdeceivers did he confess this to himself in the end in the

wisdom of his courage before death socrates wished to die not athens

but his own hand gave him the draught of hemlock he drove athens to

the poisoned cup socrates is not a doctor he whispered to himself

death alone can be a doctor here socrates himself has only been ill

a long while

types of criminalsthe criminal from strength and the criminal from

weakness this passage alludes to the latter aphorism 45 p 103

pg 17
 reason in philosophy
1
you ask me what all idiosyncrasy is in philosophers  for instance

their lack of the historical sense their hatred even of the idea of

becoming their egyptianism they imagine that they do honour to a

thing by divorcing it from history sub specie terniwhen they

make a mummy of it all the ideas that philosophers have treated for

thousands of years have been mummied concepts nothing real has ever

come out of their hands alive these idolaters of concepts merely

kill and stuff things when they worshipthey threaten the life of

everything they adore death change age as well as procreation and

growth are in their opinion objectionseven refutations that which

is cannot evolve that which evolves is not now all of them believe

and even with desperation in being but as they cannot lay hold of

it they try to discover reasons why this privilege is withheld from

them some merely apparent quality some deception must be the cause

of our not being able to ascertain the nature of being where is the

deceiver we have him they cry rejoicing it is sensuality these

senses which in other things are so immoral cheat us concerning the

true world moral we must get rid of the deception of the senses of

becoming of history ofpg 18 falsehoodhistory is nothing more than the

belief in the senses the belief in falsehood moral we must say no

to everything in which the senses believe to all the rest of mankind

all that belongs to the people let us be philosophers mummies

monotonotheists gravediggersand above all away with the body

this wretched ide fixe of the senses infected with all the faults

of logic that exist refuted even impossible although it be impudent

enough to pose as if it were real
2
with a feeling of great reverence i except the name of heraclitus

if the rest of the philosophic gang rejected the evidences of the

senses because the latter revealed a state of multifariousness and

change he rejected the same evidence because it revealed things as if

they possessed permanence and unity even heraclitus did an injustice

to the senses the latter lie neither as the eleatics believed them

to lie nor as he believed them to liethey do not lie at all the

interpretations we give to their evidence is what first introduces

falsehood into it for instance the lie of unity the lie of matter

of substance and of permanence reason is the cause of our falsifying

the evidence of the senses in so far as the senses show us a state

of becoming of transiency and of change they do not lie but in

declaring that being was an empty illusion heraclitus will remain

eternally right the apparent world is the only world the true

world is no more than a false adjunct thereto
pg 19
3
and what delicate instruments of observation we have in our senses

this human nose for instance of which no philosopher has yet spoken

with reverence and gratitude is for the present the most finely

adjusted instrument at our disposal it is able to register even such

slight changes of movement as the spectroscope would be unable to

record our scientific triumphs at the present day extend precisely

so far as we have accepted the evidence of our sensesas we have

sharpened and armed them and learned to follow them up to the

end what remains is abortive and not yet sciencethat is to say

metaphysics theology psychology epistemology or formal science or

a doctrine of symbols like logic and its applied form mathematics

in all these things reality does not come into consideration at all

even as a problem just as little as does the question concerning the

general value of such a convention of symbols as logic
4
the other idiosyncrasy of philosophers is no less dangerous it

consists in confusing the last and the first things they place that

which makes its appearance lastunfortunately for it ought not

to appear at allthe highest concept that is to say the most

general the emptiest the last cloudy streak of evaporating reality

at the beginning as the beginning this again is only their manner of

expressing their veneration the highest thing must not have grown out

of the lowest it must not have grown at all moral everything

of the first rank must bepg 20 causa sui to have been derived from

something else is as good as an objection it sets the value of a

thing in question all superior values are of the first rank all the

highest conceptsthat of being of the absolute of goodness of

truth and of perfection all these things cannot have been evolved

they must therefore be causa sui all these things cannot however be

unlike one another they cannot be opposed to one another thus they

attain to their stupendous concept god the last most attenuated and

emptiest thing is postulated as the first thing as the absolute cause

as ens realissimum fancy humanity having to take the brain diseases

of morbid cobwebspinners seriouslyand it has paid dearly for having

done so
5
against this let us set the different manner in which we you

observe that i am courteous enough to say we conceive the problem of

the error and deceptiveness of things formerly people regarded change

and evolution in general as the proof of appearance as a sign of the

fact that something must be there that leads us astray today on

the other hand we realise that precisely as far as the rational bias

forces us to postulate unity identity permanence substance cause

materiality and being we are in a measure involved in error driven

necessarily to error however certain we may feel as the result of a

strict examination of the matter that the error lies here it is just

the same here as with the motion of the sun in its case it was our

eyes that were wrong in the matter of the concepts above mentioned it

is our language itself that pleadspg 21 most constantly in their favour

in its origin language belongs to an age of the most rudimentary

forms of psychology if we try to conceive of the first conditions of

the metaphysics of language ie in plain english of reason we

immediately find ourselves in the midst of a system of fetichism for

here the doer and his deed are seen in all circumstances will is

believed in as a cause in general the ego is taken for granted the

ego as being and as substance and the faith in the ego as substance

is projected into all thingsin this way alone the concept thing

is created being is thought into and insinuated into everything as

cause from the concept ego alone can the concept being proceed

at the beginning stands the tremendously fatal error of supposing the

will to be something that actuatesa faculty now we know that it

is only a word1 very much later in a world a thousand times more

enlightened the assurance the subjective certitude in the handling

of the categories of reason came into the minds of philosophers as a

surprise they concluded that these categories could not be derived

from experienceon the contrary the whole of experience rather

contradicts them whence do they come therefore in india as in

greece the same mistake was made we must already once have lived

in a higher world instead of in a much lower one which would have

been the truth we must have been divine for we possesspg 22 reason

 nothing indeed has exercised a more simple power of persuasion

hitherto than the error of being as it was formulated by the eleatics

for instance in its favour are every word and every sentence that we

uttereven the opponents of the eleatics succumbed to the seductive

powers of their concept of being among others there was democritus in

his discovery of the atom reason in languageoh what a deceptive

old witch it has been i fear we shall never be rid of god so long as

we still believe in grammar
6
people will feel grateful to me if i condense a point of view which

is at once so important and so new into four theses by this means

i shall facilitate comprehension and shall likewise challenge

contradiction
proposition one the reasons upon which the apparent nature of this

world have been based rather tend to prove its realityany other

kind of reality defies demonstration
proposition two the characteristics with which man has endowed

the true being of things are the characteristics of nonbeing of

nonentity the true world has been erected upon a contradiction of

the real world and it is indeed an apparent world seeing that it is

merely a moralooptical delusion
proposition three there is no sense in spinning yarns about another

world provided of course that we do not possess a mighty instinct

which urges us to slander belittle and cast suspicion upon this life

in this case we should be avenging ourselves onpg 23 this life with the

phantasmagoria of another of a better life
proposition four to divide the world into a true and an apparent

world whether after the manner of christianity or of kant after all

a christian in disguise is only a sign of decadencea symptom of

degenerating life the fact that the artist esteems the appearance

of a thing higher than reality is no objection to this statement for

appearance signifies once more reality here but in a selected

strengthened and corrected form the tragic artist is no pessimisthe

says yea to everything questionable and terrible he is dionysian


1 nietzsche here refers to the concept free will of

the christians this does not mean that there is no such thing as

willthat is to say a powerful determining force from withintr
pg 24
how the true world ultimately became a fable
the history of an error
1 the true world attainable to the sage the pious man and the man of

virtuehe lives in it he is it

the most ancient form of the idea was relatively clever

simple convincing it was a paraphrase of the proposition

i plato am the truth
2 the true world which is unattainable for the moment is promised to

the sage to the pious man and to the man of virtue to the sinner who

repents

progress of the idea it becomes more subtle more

insidious more evasiveit becomes a woman it becomes

christian
3 the true world is unattainable it cannot be proved it cannot

promise anything but even as a thought alone it is a comfort an

obligation a command

at bottom this is still the old sun but seen through mist

and scepticism the idea has become sublime pale northern

knigsbergian1
pg 25
4 the true worldis it unattainable at all events it is unattained

and as unattained it is also unknown consequently it no longer

comforts nor saves nor constrains what could something unknown

constrain us to

the grey of dawn reason stretches itself and yawns for the

first time the cockcrow of positivism
5 the true worldan idea that no longer serves any purpose that

no longer constrains one to anythinga useless idea that has become

quite superfluous consequently an exploded idea let us abolish it

bright daylight breakfast the return of common sense

and of cheerfulness plato blushes for shame and all

freespirits kick up a shindy
6 we have suppressed the true world what world survives the apparent

world perhaps certainly not in abolishing the true world we have

also abolished the world of appearance

longest error mankinds zenith incipit zarathustra

life did nietzsche know that kant was simply a scotch puritan whose

family had settled in germany

pg 26
 morality as the enemy of nature
1
there is a time when all passions are simply fatal in their action

when they wreck their victims with the weight of their follyand

there is a later period a very much later period when they marry with

the spirit when they spiritualise themselves formerly owing to the

stupidity inherent in passion men waged war against passion itself

men pledged themselves to annihilate itall ancient moralmongers

were unanimous on this point il faut tuer les passions the

most famous formula for this stands in the new testament in that

sermon on the mount where let it be said incidentally things are

by no means regarded from a height it is said there for instance

with an application to sexuality if thy eye offend thee pluck it

out fortunately no christian acts in obedience to this precept

to annihilate the passions and desires simply on account of their

stupidity and to obviate the unpleasant consequences of their

stupidity seems to us today merely an aggravated form of stupidity

we no longer admire those dentists who extract teeth simply in order

that they may not ache again on the other hand it will be admitted

with some reason that on the soil from which christianity grew the

idea ofpg 27 the spiritualisation of passion could not possibly have been

conceived the early church as everyone knows certainly did wage war

against the intelligent in favour of the poor in spirit in these

circumstances how could the passions be combated intelligently the

church combats passion by means of excision of all kinds its practice

its remedy is castration it never inquires how can a desire

be spiritualised beautified deifiedin all ages it has laid the

weight of discipline in the process of extirpation the extirpation

of sensuality pride lust of dominion lust of property and

revengebut to attack the passions at their roots means attacking

life itself at its source the method of the church is hostile to life
2
the same means castration and extirpation are instinctively chosen

for waging war against a passion by those who are too weak of will

too degenerate to impose some sort of moderation upon it by those

natures who to speak in metaphor and without metaphor need

la trappe or some kind of ultimatum of war a gulf set between

themselves and a passion only degenerates find radical methods

indispensable weakness of will or more strictly speaking the

inability not to react to a stimulus is in itself simply another form

of degeneracy radical and mortal hostility to sensuality remains a

suspicious symptom it justifies one in being suspicious of the general

state of one who goes to such extremes moreover that hostility and

hatred reach their height only when such natures no longer possess

enough strength of character to adopt thepg 28 radical remedy to renounce

their inner satan look at the whole history of the priests the

philosophers and the artists as well the most poisonous diatribes

against the senses have not been said by the impotent nor by the

ascetics but by those impossible ascetics by those who found it

necessary to be ascetics
3
the spiritualisation of sensuality is called love it is a great

triumph over christianity another triumph is our spiritualisation of

hostility it consists in the fact that we are beginning to realise

very profoundly the value of having enemies in short that with them

we are forced to do and to conclude precisely the reverse of what

we previously did and concluded in all ages the church wished to

annihilate its enemies we the immoralists and antichrists see our

advantage in the survival of the church even in political life

hostility has now become more spiritualmuch more cautious much

more thoughtful and much more moderate almost every party sees its

selfpreservative interests in preventing the opposition from going

to pieces and the same applies to politics on a grand scale a new

creation more particularly like the new empire has more need

of enemies than friends only as a contrast does it begin to feel

necessary only as a contrast does it become necessary and we behave

in precisely the same way to the inner enemy in this quarter too we

have spiritualised enmity in this quarter too we have understood its

value a man is productive only in so far as he is rich in contrasted

instincts he can remain young only onpg 29 condition that his soul does

not begin to take things easy and to yearn for peace nothing has

grown more alien to us than that old desirethe peace of the soul

which is the aim of christianity nothing could make us less envious

than the moral cow and the plump happiness of a clean conscience the

man who has renounced war has renounced a grand life in many cases

of course peace of the soul is merely a misunderstandingit is

something very different which has failed to find a more honest name

for itself without either circumlocution or prejudice i will suggest a

few cases peace of the soul may for instance be the sweet effulgence

of rich animality in the realm of morality or religion or the first

presage of weariness the first shadow that evening every kind of

evening is wont to cast or a sign that the air is moist and that

winds are blowing up from the south or unconscious gratitude for a

good digestion sometimes called brotherly love or the serenity

of the convalescent on whose lips all things have a new taste and

who bides his time or the condition which follows upon a thorough

gratification of our strongest passion the wellbeing of unaccustomed

satiety or the senility of our will of our desires and of our vices

or laziness coaxed by vanity into togging itself out in a moral garb

or the ending of a state of long suspense and of agonising uncertainty

by a state of certainty of even terrible certainty or the expression

of ripeness and mastery in the midst of a task of a creative work of

a production of a thing willed the calm breathing that denotes that

freedom of will has been attainedpg 30 who knowsmaybe the twilight

of the idols is only a sort of peace of the soul
4
i will formulate a principle all naturalism in moralitythat is to

say every sound morality is ruled by a life instinctany one of

the laws of life is fulfilled by the definite canon thou shalt

thou shalt not and any sort of obstacle or hostile element in the

road of life is thus cleared away conversely the morality which is

antagonistic to naturethat is to say almost every morality that has

been taught honoured and preached hitherto is directed precisely

against the lifeinstinctsit is a condemnation now secret now

blatant and impudent of these very instincts inasmuch as it says god

sees into the heart of man it says nay to the profoundest and most

superior desires of life and takes god as the enemy of life the saint

in whom god is well pleased is the ideal eunuch life terminates where

the kingdom of god begins
5
admitting that you have understood the villainy of such a mutiny

against life as that which has become almost sacrosanct in christian

morality you have fortunately understood something besides and that

is the futility the fictitiousness the absurdity and the falseness

of such a mutiny for the condemnation of life by a living creature is

after all but the symptom of a definite kind of life the question as

to whether the condemnation is justified or the reverse is not even

raised in order even to approach the problem of the value of life

a man would needpg 31 to be placed outside life and moreover know it as

well as one as many as all in fact who have lived it these are

reasons enough to prove to us that this problem is an inaccessible one

to us when we speak of values we speak under the inspiration and

through the optics of life life itself urges us to determine values

life itself values through us when we determine values from which it

follows that even that morality which is antagonistic to life and

which conceives god as the opposite and the condemnation of life is

only a valuation of lifeof what life of what kind of life but i

have already answered this question it is the valuation of declining

of enfeebled of exhausted and of condemned life morality as it has

been understood hithertoas it was finally formulated by schopenhauer

in the words the denial of the will to life is the instinct of

degeneration itself which converts itself into an imperative it says

perish it is the death sentence of men who are already doomed
6
let us at last consider how exceedingly simple it is on our part to

say man should be thus and thus reality shows us a marvellous

wealth of types and a luxuriant variety of forms and changes and yet

the first wretch of a moral loafer that comes along cries no man

should be different he even knows what man should be like does this

sanctimonious prig he draws his own face on the wall and declares

ecce homo but even when the moralist addresses himself only to the

individual and says thus and thus shouldst thou be he still makespg 32

an ass of himself the individual in his past and future is a piece of

fate one law the more one necessity the more for all that is to come

and is to be to say to him change thyself is tantamount to saying

that everything should change even backwards as well truly these have

been consistent moralists they wished man to be different ie

virtuous they wished him to be after their own imagethat is to say

sanctimonious humbugs and to this end they denied the world no slight

form of insanity no modest form of immodesty morality in so far it

condemns per se and not out of any aim consideration or motive of

life is a specific error for which no one should feel any mercy a

degenerate idiosyncrasy that has done an unutterable amount of harm

we others we immoralists on the contrary have opened our hearts

wide to all kinds of comprehension understanding and approbation1

we do not deny readily we glory in saying yea to things our eyes

have opened ever wider and wider to that economy which still employs

and knows how to use to its own advantage all that which the sacred

craziness of priests and the morbid reason in priests rejects to

that economy in the law of life which draws its own advantage even out

of the repulsive race of bigots the priests and the virtuouswhat

advantagebut we ourselves we immoralists are the reply to this

question


1 cf spinoza who says in the tractatus politico

1677 chap i  4 sedulo curavi humanas actiones non ridere

non tugert negue detestari sed intelligere i have carefully

endeavoured not to deride or deplore or detest human actions but to

understand themtr

pg 33
 the four great errors
1
the error of the confusion of cause and effectthere is no more

dangerous error than to confound the effect with the cause i call

this error the intrinsic perversion of reason nevertheless this error

is one of the most ancient and most recent habits of mankind in one

part of the world it has even been canonised and it bears the name of

religion and morality every postulate formulated by religion and

morality contains it priests and the promulgators of moral laws are the

promoters of this perversion of reasonlet me give you an example

everybody knows the book of the famous cornaro in which he recommends

his slender diet as the recipe for a long happy and also virtuous

life few books have been so widely read and to this day many thousand

copies of it are still printed annually in england i do not doubt that

there is scarcely a single book the bible of course excepted that

has worked more mischief shortened more lives than this wellmeant

curiosity the reason of this is the confusion of effect and cause

this worthy italian saw the cause of his long life in his diet whereas

the prerequisites of long life which are exceptional slowness of

molecular change and a low rate of expenditure in energy were the

cause of his meagrepg 34 diet he was not at liberty to eat a small or a

great amount his frugality was not the result of free choice he would

have been ill had he eaten more he who does not happen to be a carp

however is not only wise to eat well but is also compelled to do so

a scholar of the present day with his rapid consumption of nervous

energy would soon go to the dogs on cornaros diet crede experto
2
the most general principle lying at the root of every religion and

morality is this do this and that and avoid this and thatand

thou wilt be happy otherwise every morality and every

religion is this imperativei call it the great original sin of

reasonimmortal unreason in my mouth this principle is converted

into its oppositefirst example of my transvaluation of all values

a wellconstituted man a man who is one of natures lucky strokes

must perform certain actions and instinctively fear other actions

he introduces the element of order of which he is the physiological

manifestation into his relations with men and things in a formula

his virtue is the consequence of his good constitution longevity

and plentiful offspring are not the reward of virtue virtue itself

is on the contrary that retardation of the metabolic process which

among other things results in a long life and in plentiful offspring

in short in cornarism the church and morality say a race a

people perish through vice and luxury my reinstated reason says

when a people are going topg 35 the dogs when they are degenerating

physiologically vice and luxury that is to say the need of ever

stronger and more frequent stimuli such as all exhausted natures are

acquainted with are bound to result such and such a young man grows

pale and withered prematurely his friends say this or that illness

is the cause of it i say the fact that he became ill the fact that

he did not resist illness was in itself already the outcome of

impoverished life of hereditary exhaustion the newspaper reader says

such and such a party by committing such an error will meet its death

my superior politics say a party that can make such mistakes is in

its last agonyit no longer possesses any certainty of instinct every

mistake is in every sense the sequel to degeneration of the instincts

to disintegration of the will this is almost the definition of evil

everything valuable is instinctand consequently easy necessary

free exertion is an objection the god is characteristically different

from the hero in my language light feet are the first attribute of

divinity
3
the error of false causality in all ages men have believed that

they knew what a cause was but whence did we derive this knowledge

or more accurately this faith in the fact that we know out of the

realm of the famous inner facts of consciousness not one of which

has yet proved itself to be a fact we believed ourselves to be causes

even in the action of the will we thought that in this matter at

least we caught causality redhanded no onepg 36 doubted that all the

antecedentia of an action were to be sought in consciousness and

could be discovered thereas motiveif only they were sought

otherwise we should not be free to perform them we should not have

been responsible for them finally who would have questioned that a

thought is caused that the ego causes the thought of these three

facts of inner consciousness by means of which causality seemed to

be guaranteed the first and most convincing is that of the will as

cause the conception of consciousness spirit as a cause and

subsequently that of the ego the subject as a cause were merely

born afterwards once the causality of the will stood established

as given as a fact of experience meanwhile we have come to our

senses today we no longer believe a word of all this the inner

world is full of phantoms and willothewisps the will is one of

these the will no longer actuates consequently it no longer explains

anythingall it does is to accompany processes it may even be absent

the socalled motive is another error it is merely a ripple on

the surface of consciousness a side issue of the action which is

much more likely to conceal than to reveal the antecedentia of the

latter and as for the ego it has become legendary fictional a

play upon words it has ceased utterly and completely from thinking

feeling and willing what is the result of it all there are no such

things as spiritual causes the whole of popular experience on this

subject went to the devil that is the result of it all for we had

blissfully abused that experience we had built the world upon it as a

world of causes as a worldpg 37 of will as a world of spirit the most

antiquated and most traditional psychology has been at work here it

has done nothing else all phenomena were deeds in the light of this

psychology and all deeds were the result of will according to it the

world was a complex mechanism of agents an agent a subject lay

at the root of all things man projected his three inner facts of

consciousness the will the spirit and the ego in which he believed

most firmly outside himself he first deduced the concept being out

of the concept ego he supposed things to exist as he did himself

according to his notion of the ego as cause was it to be wondered at

that later on he always found in things only that which he had laid

in themthe thing itself i repeat the concept thing was merely a

reflex of the belief in the ego as cause and even your atom my dear

good mechanists and physicists what an amount of error of rudimentary

psychology still adheres to itnot to speak of the thinginitself

of the horrendum pudendum of the metaphysicians the error of spirit

regarded as a cause confounded with reality and made the measure of

reality and called god
4
the error of imaginary causes starting out from dreamland we

find that to any definite sensation like that produced by a distant

cannon shot for instance we are wont to ascribe a cause after the

fact very often quite a little romance in which the dreamer himself

is of course the hero meanwhile the sensation becomes protracted

like a sort ofpg 38 continuous echo until as it were the instinct of

causality allows it to come to the front rank no longer however as a

chance occurrence but as a thing which has some meaning the cannon

shot presents itself in a causal manner by means of an apparent

reversal in the order of time that which occurs last the motivation

is experienced first often with a hundred details which flash past

like lightning and the shot is the result what has happened the

ideas suggested by a particular state of our senses are misinterpreted

as the cause of that state as a matter of fact we proceed in precisely

the same manner when we are awake the greater number of our general

sensationsevery kind of obstacle pressure tension explosion in

the interplay of the organs and more particularly the condition of

the nervus sympathiesstimulate our instinct of causality we will

have a reason which will account for our feeling thus or thusfor

feeling ill or well we are never satisfied by merely ascertaining

the fact that we feel thus or thus we admit this factwe become

conscious of itonly when we have attributed it to some kind of

motivation memory which in such circumstances unconsciously becomes

active adduces former conditions of a like kind together with the

causal interpretations with which they are associatedbut not their

real cause the belief that the ideas the accompanying processes

of consciousness have been the causes is certainly produced by

the agency of memory and in this way we become accustomed to a

particular interpretation of causes which truth to tell actually

hinders and even utterly prevents the investigation of the proper

cause
pg 39
5
the psychological explanation of the above fact to trace something

unfamiliar back to something familiar is at once a relief a comfort

and a satisfaction while it also produces a feeling of power the

unfamiliar involves danger anxiety and carethe fundamental instinct

is to get rid of these painful circumstances first principle any

explanation is better than none at all since at bottom it is

only a question of shaking ones self free from certain oppressive

ideas the means employed to this end are not selected with overmuch

punctiliousness the first idea by means of which the unfamiliar is

revealed as familiar produces a feeling of such comfort that it is

held to be true the proof of happiness of power as the criterion

of truth the instinct of causality is therefore conditioned and

stimulated by the feeling of fear whenever possible the question

why should not only educe the cause as cause but rather a certain

kind of causea comforting liberating and reassuring cause the first

result of this need is that something known or already experienced and

recorded in the memory is posited as the cause the new factor that

which has not been experienced and which is unfamiliar is excluded

from the sphere of causes not only do we try to find a certain kind

of explanation as the cause but those kinds of explanations are

selected and preferred which dissipate most rapidly the sensation of

strangeness novelty and unfamiliarityin fact the most ordinary

explanations and the result is that a certain manner of postulating

causes tends to predominate ever more and more becomes concentratedpg 40

into a system and finally reigns supreme to the complete exclusion

of all other causes and explanations the banker thinks immediately of

business the christian of sin and the girl of her love affair
6
the whole domain of morality and religion may be classified under the

rubric imaginary causes the explanation of general unpleasant

sensations these sensations are dependent upon certain creatures who

are hostile to us evil spirits the most famous example of thisthe

mistaking of hysterical women for witches these sensations are

dependent upon actions which are reprehensible the feeling of sin

sinfulness is a manner of accounting for a certain physiological

disorderpeople always find reasons for being dissatisfied with

themselves these sensations depend upon punishment upon compensation

for something which we ought not to have done which we ought not

to have been this idea was generalised in a more impudent form by

schopenhauer into that principle in which morality appears in its real

coloursthat is to say as a veritable poisoner and slanderer of

life all great suffering whether mental or physical reveals what

we deserve for it could not visit us if we did not deserve it the

world as will and idea vol 2 p 666 these sensations are the

outcome of illconsidered actions having evil consequences the

passions the senses postulated as causes as guilty by means of

other calamities distressing physiological conditions are interpreted

as meritedthe explanation of pleasant sensations these

sensations arepg 41 dependent upon a trust in god they may depend upon

our consciousness of having done one or two good actions a socalled

good conscience is a physiological condition which may be the

outcome of good digestion they may depend upon the happy issue of

certain undertakings an ingenuous mistake the happy issue of an

undertaking certainly does not give a hypochondriac or a pascal any

general sensation of pleasure they may depend upon faith love and

hopethe christian virtues as a matter of fact all these pretended

explanations are but the results of certain states and as it were

translations of feelings of pleasure and pain into a false dialect a

man is in a condition of hopefulness because the dominant physiological

sensation of his being is again one of strength and wealth he trusts

in god because the feeling of abundance and power gives him a peaceful

state of mind morality and religion are completely and utterly parts

of the psychology of error in every particular case cause and effect

are confounded as truth is confounded with the effect of that which is

believed to be true or a certain state of consciousness is confounded

with the chain of causes which brought it about
7
the error of freewill at present we no longer have any mercy upon

the concept freewill we know only too well what it isthe most

egregious theological trick that has ever existed for the purpose of

making mankind responsible in a theological mannerthat is to

say to make mankind dependent upon theologians i will now explain

to you onlypg 42 the psychology of the whole process of inculcating the

sense of responsibility wherever men try to trace responsibility

home to anyone it is the instinct of punishment and of the desire

to judge which is active becoming is robbed of its innocence when

any particular condition of things is traced to a will to intentions

and to responsible actions the doctrine of the will was invented

principally for the purpose of punishmentthat is to say with

the intention of tracing guilt the whole of ancient psychology

or the psychology of the will is the outcome of the fact that its

originators who were the priests at the head of ancient communities

wanted to create for themselves a right to administer punishmentsor

the right for god to do so men were thought of as free in order that

they might be judged and punishedin order that they might be held

guilty consequently every action had to be regarded as voluntary

and the origin of every action had to be imagined as lying in

consciousnessin this way the most fundamentally fraudulent character

of psychology was established as the very principle of psychology

itself now that we have entered upon the opposite movement now that

we immoralists are trying with all our power to eliminate the concepts

of guilt and punishment from the world once more and to cleanse

psychology history nature and all social institutions and customs

of all signs of those two concepts we recognise no more radical

opponents than the theologians who with their notion of a moral order

of things still continue to pollute the innocence of becoming with

punishment and guilt christianity is the metaphysics of the hangman
pg 43
8
what then alone can our teaching bethat no one gives man his

qualities neither god society his parents his ancestors nor

himself this nonsensical idea which is at last refuted here was

taught as intelligible freedom by kant and perhaps even as early

as plato himself no one is responsible for the fact that he exists

at all that he is constituted as he is and that he happens to be in

certain circumstances and in a particular environment the fatality of

his being cannot be divorced from the fatality of all that which has

been and will be this is not the result of an individual intention

of a will of an aim there is no attempt at attaining to any ideal

man or ideal happiness or ideal morality with himit is absurd

to wish him to be careering towards some sort of purpose we invented

the concept purpose in reality purpose is altogether lacking one

is necessary one is a piece of fate one belongs to the whole one is

in the wholethere is nothing that could judge measure compare

and condemn our existence for that would mean judging measuring

comparing and condemning the whole but there is nothing outside the

whole the fact that no one shall any longer be made responsible that

the nature of existence may not be traced to a causa prima that the

world is an entity neither as a sensorium nor as a spiritthis alone

is the great deliverancethus alone is the innocence of becoming

restored the concept god has been the greatest objection to

existence hitherto we deny god we deny responsibility in god thus

alone do we save the world

pg 44
 the improvers of mankind
1
you are aware of my demand upon philosophers that they should take

up a stand beyond good and evilthat they should have the illusion

of the moral judgment beneath them this demand is the result of a

point of view which i was the first to formulate that there are no

such things as moral facts moral judgment has this in common with

the religious one that it believes in realities which are not real

morality is only an interpretation of certain phenomena or more

strictly speaking a misinterpretation of them moral judgment like

the religious one belongs to a stage of ignorance in which even the

concept of reality the distinction between real and imagined things

is still lacking so that truth at such a stage is applied to a host

of things which today we call imaginary that is why the moral

judgment must never be taken quite literally as such it is sheer

nonsense as a sign code however it is invaluable to him at least

who knows it reveals the most valuable facts concerning cultures and

inner conditions which did not know enough to understand themselves

morality is merely a signlanguage simply symptomatology one must

already know what it is all about in order to turn it to any use
pg 45
2
let me give you one example quite provisionally in all ages there

have been people who wished to improve mankind this above all

is what was called morality but the most different tendencies

are concealed beneath the same word both the taming of the beast

man and the rearing of a particular type of man have been called

improvement these zoological termini alone represent real

thingsreal things of which the typical improver the priest

naturally knows nothing and will know nothing to call the taming

of an animal improving it sounds to our ears almost like a joke

he who knows what goes on in menageries doubts very much whether an

animal is improved in such places it is certainly weakened it is

made less dangerous and by means of the depressing influence of fear

pain wounds and hunger it is converted into a sick animal and the

same holds good of the tamed man whom the priest has improved in

the early years of the middle ages during which the church was most

distinctly and above all a menagerie the most beautiful examples of

the blond beast were hunted down in all directionsthe noble

germans for instance were improved but what did this improved

german who had been lured to the monastery look like after the

process he looked like a caricature of man like an abortion he had

become a sinner he was caged up he had been imprisoned behind a

host of apparling notions he now lay there sick wretched malevolent

even toward himself full of hate for thepg 46 instincts of life full of

suspicion in regard to all that is still strong and happy in short a

christian in physiological terms in a fight with an animal the

only way of making it weak may be to make it sick the church undersood

this it ruined man it made him weakbut it laid claim to having

improved him
3
now let us consider the other case which is called morality the

case of the rearing of a particular race and species the most

magnificent example of this is offered by indian morality and is

sanctioned religiously as the law of manu in this book the task

is set of rearing no less than four races at once a priestly race

a warrior race a merchant and agricultural race and finally a race

of servantsthe sudras it is quite obvious that we are no longer

in a circus watching tamers of wild animals in this book to have

conceived even the plan of such a breeding scheme presupposes the

existence of a man who is a hundred times milder and more reasonable

than the mere liontamer one breathes more freely after stepping out

of the christian atmosphere of hospitals and prisons into this more

salubrious loftier and more spacious world what a wretched thing the

new testament is beside manu what an evil odour hangs around itbut

even this organisation found it necessary to be terriblenot this

time in a struggle with the animalman but with his opposite the

noncaste man the hotchpotch man the chandala and once again it

had no other means of making him weak and harmless than by making

him sickit was the struggle with the greatestpg 47 number nothing

perhaps is more offensive to our feelings than these measures of

security on the part of indian morality the third edict for instance

avadanasastra i which treats of impure vegetables ordains that

the only nourishment that the chandala should be allowed must consist

of garlic and onions as the holy scriptures forbid their being given

corn or grainbearing fruit water and fire the same edict declares

that the water which they need must be drawn neither out of rivers

wells or ponds but only out of the ditches leading to swamps and out

of the holes left by the footprints of animals they are likewise

forbidden to wash either their linen or themselves since the water

which is graciously granted to them must only be used for quenching

their thirst finally sudra women are forbidden to assist chandala

women at their confinements while chandala women are also forbidden to

assist each other at such times the results of sanitary regulations of

this kind could not fail to make themselves felt deadly epidemics and

the most ghastly venereal diseases soon appeared and in consequence

of these again the law of the knifethat is to say circumcision

was prescribed for male children and the removal of the small labia

from the females manu himself says the chandala are the fruit of

adultery incest and crime this is the necessary consequence of the

idea of breeding their clothes shall consist only of the rags torn

from corpses their vessels shall be the fragments of broken pottery

their ornaments shall be made of old iron and their religion shall be

the worship of evil spirits without rest they shall wander from place

to placepg 48 they are forbidden to write from left to right or to use

their right hand in writing the use of the right hand and writing from

left to right are reserved to people of virtue to people of race
4
these regulations are instructive enough we can see in them the

absolutely pure and primeval humanity of the aryanswe learn that

the notion pure blood is the reverse of harmless on the other hand

it becomes clear among which people the hatred the chandala hatred

of this humanity has been immortalised among which people it has

become religion and genius from this point of view the gospels are

documents of the highest value and the book of enoch is still more

so christianity as sprung from jewish roots and comprehensible only

as grown upon this soil represents the countermovement against that

morality of breeding of race and of privilegeit is essentially an

antiaryan religion christianity is the transvaluation of all aryan

values the triumph of chandala values the proclaimed gospel of the

poor and of the low the general insurrection of all the downtrodden

the wretched the bungled and the botched against the racethe

immortal revenge of the chandala as the religion of love
5
the morality of breeding and the morality of taming in the means which

they adopt in order to prevail are quite worthy of each other we may

lay down as a leading principle that in order to create morality a

man must have the absolute will topg 49 immorality this is the great and

strange problem with which i have so long been occupied the psychology

of the improvers of mankind a small and at bottom perfectly

insignificant fact known as the pia fraus first gave me access

to this problem the pia fraus the heirloom of all philosophers and

priests who improve mankind neither manu nor plato nor confucius

nor the teachers of judaism and christianity have ever doubted their

right to falsehood they have never doubted their right to quite a

number of other things to express oneself in a formula one might

sayall means which have been used heretofore with the object of

making man moral were through and through immoral

pg 50
 things the germans lack
1
among germans at the present day it does not suffice to have intellect

one is actually forced to appropriate it to lay claim to it
maybe i know the germans perhaps i may tell them a few hometruths

modern germany represents such an enormous store of inherited and

acquired capacity that for some time it might spend this accumulated

treasure even with some prodigality it is no superior culture that has

ultimately become prevalent with this modern tendency nor is it by any

means delicate taste or noble beauty of the instincts but rather a

number of virtues more manly than any that other european countries can

show an amount of good spirits and selfrespect plenty of firmness

in human relations and in the reciprocity of duties much industry and

much perseveranceand a certain inherited soberness which is much more

in need of a spur than of a brake let me add that in this country

people still obey without feeling that obedience humiliates and no one

despises his opponent
you observe that it is my desire to be fair to the germans and in this

respect i should not like to be untrue to myselfi must therefore

also state my objections to them it costs a good deal topg 51 attain to a

position of power for power stultifies the germansthey were once

called a people of thinkers do they really think at all at present

nowadays the germans are bored by intellect they mistrust intellect

politics have swallowed up all earnestness for really intellectual

thingsgermany germany above all1 i fear this was the deathblow

to german philosophy are there any german philosophers are there any

german poets are there any good german books people ask me abroad i

blush but with that pluck which is peculiar to me even in moments of

desperation i reply yes bismarckcould i have dared to confess

what books are read today cursed instinct of mediocrity
2
what might not german intellect have beenwho has not thought sadly

upon this question but this nation has deliberately stultified itself

for almost a thousand years nowhere else have the two great european

narcotics alcohol and christianity been so viciously abused as in

germany recently a third opiate was added to the list one which in

itself alone would have sufficed to complete the ruin of all subtle

and daring intellectual animation i speak of music our costive and

constipating german music how much peevish ponderousness paralysis

dampness dressinggown languor and beer is there not in german

intelligence
how is it really possible that young men whopg 52 consecrate their whole

lives to the pursuit of intellectual ends should not feel within them

the first instinct of intellectuality the selfpreservative instinct

of the intellectand should drink beer the alcoholism of learned

youths does not incapacitate them for becoming scholarsa man quite

devoid of intellect may be a great scholarbut it is a problem in

every other respect where can that soft degeneracy not be found which

is produced in the intellect by beer i once laid my finger upon a case

of this sort which became almost famousthe degeneration of our

leading german freespirit the clever david strauss into the author

of a suburban gospel and new faith not in vain had he sung the praises

of the dear old brown liquor in versetrue unto death
3
i have spoken of german intellect i have said that it is becoming

coarser and shallower is that enoughin reality something very

different frightens me and that is the ever steady decline of

german earnestness german profundity and german passion in things

intellectual not only intellectuality but also pathos has altered

from time to time i come in touch with german universities what

an extraordinary atmosphere prevails among their scholars what

barrenness and what selfsatisfied and lukewarm intellectuality for

any one to point to german science as an argument against me would show

that he grossly misunderstood my meaning while it would also prove

that he had not read a word of my writings for seventeenpg 53 years i

have done little else than expose the deintellectualising influence

of our modern scientific studies the severe slavery to which every

individual nowadays is condemned by the enormous range covered by the

sciences is the chief reason why fuller richer and profounder natures

can find no education or educators that are fit for them nothing

is more deleterious to this age than the superfluity of pretentious

loafers and fragmentary human beings our universities are really

the involuntary forcing houses for this kind of witheringup of the

instincts of intellectuality and the whole of europe is beginning

to know thispolitics on a large scale deceive no one germany is

becoming ever more and more the flatland of europe i am still in

search of a german with whom i could be serious after my own fashion

and how much more am i in search of one with whom i could be cheerful

the twilight of the idols ah what man today would be capable

of understanding the kind of seriousness from which a philosopher is

recovering in this work it is our cheerfulness that people understand

let us examine another aspect of the question it is not only obvious

that german culture is declining but adequate reasons for this decline

are not lacking after all nobody can spend more than he hasthis

is true of individuals it is also true of nations if you spend

your strength in acquiring power or in politics on a large scale

or in economy or in universal commerce or in parliamentarism or

in military interestsif you dissipate the modicumpg 54 of reason of

earnestness of will and of selfcontrol that constitutes your nature

in one particular fashion you cannot dissipate it in another culture

and the statelet no one be deceived on this pointare antagonists

a culturestate2 is merely a modern idea the one lives upon

the other the one flourishes at the expense of the other all great

periods of culture have been periods of political decline that which

is great from the standpoint of culture was always unpoliticaleven

antipolitical goethes heart opened at the coming of napoleonit

closed at the thought of the wars of liberation at the very moment

when germany arose as a great power in the world of politics france

won new importance as a force in the world of culture even at this

moment a large amount of fresh intellectual earnestness and passion

has emigrated to paris the question of pessimism for instance

and the question of wagner in france almost all psychological and

artistic questions are considered with incomparably more subtlety and

thoroughness than they are in germanythe germans are even incapable

of this kind of earnestness in the history of european culture the

rise of the empire signifies above all a displacement of the centre

of gravity everywhere people are already aware of this in things that

really matterand these after all constitute culturethe germans

are no longer worth considering i ask you can you show me one single

man of brains who could bepg 55 mentioned in the same breath with other

european thinkers like your goethe your hegel your heinrich heine

and your schopenhauerthe fact that there is no longer a single

german philosopher worth mentioning is an increasing wonder

everything that matters has been lost sight of by the whole of the

higher educational system of germany the end quite as much as the

means to that end people forget that education the process of

cultivation itself is the endand not the empirethey forget that

the educator is required for this endand not the publicschool

teacher and university scholar educators are needed who are themselves

educated superior and noble intellects who can prove that they are

thus qualified that they are ripe and mellow products of culture

at every moment of their lives in word and in gesturenot the

learned louts who like superior wetnurses are now thrust upon the

youth of the land by public schools and universities with but rare

exceptions that which is lacking in germany is the first prerequisite

of educationthat is to say the educators hence the decline of

german culture one of those rarest exceptions is my highly respected

friend jacob burckhardt of ble to him above all is ble indebted

for its foremost position in human culture what the higher schools

of germany really do accomplish is this they brutally train a vast

crowd of young men in the smallest amount of time possible to become

useful and exploitable servants of the statepg 56 higher education

and a vast crowdthese terms contradict each other from the start

all superior education can only concern the exception a man must be

privileged in order to have a right to such a great privilege all

great and beautiful things cannot be a common possession pulchrum

est paucorum hominumwhat is it that brings about the decline of

german culture the fact that higher education is no longer a special

privilegethe democracy of a process of cultivation that has become

general common nor must it be forgotten that the privileges of

the military profession by urging many too many to attend the higher

schools involve the downfall of the latter in modern germany nobody

is at liberty to give his children a noble education in regard to

their teachers their curricula and their educational aims our higher

schools are one and all established upon a fundamentally doubtful

mediocre basis everywhere too a hastiness which is unbecoming rules

supreme just as if something would be forfeited if the young man were

not finished at the age of twentythree or did not know how to

reply to the most essential question which calling to choosethe

superior kind of man if you please does not like callings

precisely because he knows himself to be called he has time he takes

time he cannot possibly think of becoming finishedin the matter

of higher culture a man of thirty years is a beginner a child our

overcrowded publicschools our accumulation of foolishly manufactured

publicschool masters are a scandal maybe there are very serious

motives for defending this state of affairs as was shown quitepg 57

recently by the professors of heidelberg but there can be no reasons

for doing so
6
in order to be true to my nature which is affirmative and which

concerns itself with contradictions and criticism only indirectly

and with reluctance let me state at once what the three objects

are for which we need educators people must learn to see they

must learn to think and they must learn to speak and to write the

object of all three of these pursuits is a noble culture to learn

to seeto accustom the eye to calmness to patience and to allow

things to come up to it to defer judgment and to acquire the habit

of approaching and grasping an individual case from all sides this

is the first preparatory schooling of intellectuality one must not

respond immediately to a stimulus one must acquire a command of the

obstructing and isolating instincts to learn to see as i understand

this matter amounts almost to that which in popular language is

called strength of will its essential feature is precisely not

to wish to see to be able to postpone ones decision all lack of

intellectuality all vulgarity arises out of the inability to resist

a stimulusone must respond or react every impulse is indulged in

many cases such necessary action is already a sign of morbidity of

decline and a symptom of exhaustion almost everything that coarse

popular language characterises as vicious is merely that physiological

inability to refrain from reactingas an instance of what it means

to have learnt to see let me state that a manpg 58 thus trained will as a

learner have become generally slow suspicious and refractory with

hostile calm he will first allow every kind of strange and new thing

to come right up to himhe will draw back his hand at its approach

to stand with all the doors of ones soul wide open to lie slavishly

in the dust before every trivial fact at all times of the day to be

strained ready for the leap in order to deposit ones self to plunge

ones self into other souls and other things in short the famous

objectivity of modern times is bad taste it is essentially vulgar

and cheap
7
as to learning how to thinkour schools no longer have any notion

of such a thing even at the universities among the actual scholars

in philosophy logic as a theory as a practical pursuit and as a

business is beginning to die out turn to any german book you will

not find the remotest trace of a realisation that there is such a

thing as a technique a plan of study a will to mastery in the

matter of thinkingthat thinking insists upon being learnt just

as dancing insists upon being learnt and that thinking insists upon

being learnt as a form of dancing what single german can still say he

knows from experience that delicate shudder which light footfalls

in matters intellectual cause to pervade his whole body and limbs

stiff awkwardness in intellectual attitudes and the clumsy fist in

graspingthese things are so essentially german that outside germany

they are absolutely confounded with the german spirit the german

has no fingers for delicate nuances  the fact thatpg 59 the people of

germany have actually tolerated their philosophers more particularly

that most deformed cripple of ideas that has ever existedthe great

kant gives one no inadequate notion of their native elegance for

truth to tell dancing in all its forms cannot be excluded from the

curriculum of all noble education dancing with the feet with ideas

with words and need i add that one must also be able to dance with

the penthat one must learn how to writebut at this stage i should

become utterly enigmatical to german readers

g eliotthey are rid of the christian god and therefore

think it all the more incumbent upon them to hold tight to christian

morality this is an english way of reasoning but let us not take it

ill in moral females  la eliot in england every man who indulges

in any trifling emancipation from theology must retrieve his honour

in the most terrifying manner by becoming a moral fanatic that is how

they do penance in that countryas for us we act differently when

we renounce the christian faith we abandon all right to christian

morality this is not by any means selfevident and in defiance of

english shallowpates the point must be made ever more and more plain

christianity is a system a complete outlook upon the world conceived

as a whole if its leading concept the belief in god is wrenched

from it the whole is destroyed nothing vital remains in our grasp

christianity presupposes that man does not and cannot know what is

good or bad for him the christian believes in god who alone can

know these things christian morality is a command its origin is

transcendental it is beyond all criticism all right to criticism

it is true only on condition that god is truthit stands or falls

with the belief in god if the english really believe that they know

intuitively and of their own accord what is good and evil if

therefore they assert that they no longer need christianity as a

guarantee of morality this in itself is simply the outcome of the

dominion of christian valuations and a proof of the strength and

profundity of this dominion it only shows that the origin ofpg 64 english

morality has been forgotten and that its exceedingly relative right to

exist is no longer felt for englishmen morality is not yet a problem

a moral for psychologists do not go in for any notebook psychology

never observe for the sake of observing such things lead to a false

point of view to a squint to something forced and exaggerated

to experience things on purposethis is not a bit of good in the

midst of an experience a man should not turn his eyes upon himself

in such casespg 65 any eye becomes the evil eye a born psychologist

instinctively avoids seeing for the sake of seeing and the same holds

good of the born painter such a man never works from naturehe

leaves it to his instinct to his camera obscura to sift and to

define the fact nature the experience the general idea

the conclusion the result is the only thing that reaches his

consciousness he knows nothing of that wilful process of deducing

from particular cases what is the result when a man sets about this

matter differentlywhen for instance after the manner of parisian

novelists he goes in for notebook psychology on a large and small

scale such a man is constantly spying on reality and every evening

he bears home a handful of fresh curios but look at the resulta

mass of daubs at best a piece of mosaic in any case something heaped

together restless and garish the goncourts are the greatest sinners

in this respect they cannot put three sentences together which are not

absolutely painful to the eyethe eye of the psychologist from an

artistic standpoint nature is no model it exaggerates distorts and

leaves gaps nature is the accident to study from nature seems to

me a bad sign it betrays submission weakness fatalismthis lying

in the dust before trivial facts is unworthy of a thorough artist to

see what isis the function of another order of intellects the

concerning the psychology of the artist for art to be possible at

allthat is to say in order that anpg 66 sthetic mode of action and of

observation may exist a certain preliminary physiological state is

indispensable ecstasy1 this state of ecstasy must first have

intensified the susceptibility of the whole machine otherwise no art

is possible all kinds of ecstasy however differently produced have

this power to create art and above all the state dependent upon sexual

excitementthis most venerable and primitive form of ecstasy the same

applies to that ecstasy which is the outcome of all great desires

all strong passions the ecstasy of the feast of the arena of the

act of bravery of victory of all extreme action the ecstasy of

cruelty the ecstasy of destruction the ecstasy following upon certain

meteorological influences as for instance that of springtime or upon

the use of narcotics and finally the ecstasy of will that ecstasy

which results from accumulated and surging willpowerthe essential

feature of ecstasy is the feeling of increased strength and abundance

actuated by this feeling a man gives of himself to things he

forces them to partake of his riches he does violence to themthis

proceeding is called idealising let us rid ourselves of a prejudice

here idealising does not consist as is generally believed in a

suppression or an elimination of detail or of unessential features

a stupendous accentuation of the principal characteristics is by

far the most decisive factor at work and in consequence the minor

characteristics vanish
pg 67

in this state a man enriches everything from out his own abundance

what he sees what he wills he sees distended compressed strong

overladen with power he transfigures things until they reflect his

poweruntil they are stamped with his perfection this compulsion

to transfigure into the beautiful isart everythingeven that which

he is notis nevertheless to such a man a means of rejoicing over

himself in art man rejoices over himself as perfectionit is

possible to imagine a contrary state a specifically antiartistic

state of the instinctsa state in which a man impoverishes

attenuates and draws the blood from everything and truth to tell

history is full of such antiartists of such creatures of low

vitality who have no choice but to appropriate everything they see

and to suck its blood and make it thinner this is the case with the

genuine christian pascal for instance there is no such thing as a

christian who is also an artist  let no one be so childish as to

suggest raphael or any homeopathic christian of the nineteenth century

as an objection to this statement raphael said yea raphael did

yeaconsequently raphael was no christian
10
what is the meaning of the antithetical concepts apollonian and

dionysian which i have introduced into the vocabulary of sthetic as

representing two distinct modes of ecstasyapollonian ecstasy acts

above all as a force stimulating the eye so that it acquires the power

of vision the painter thepg 68 sculptor the epic poet are essentially

visionaries in the dionysian state on the other hand the whole

system of passions is stimulated and intensified so that it discharges

itself by all the means of expression at once and vents all its power

of representation of imitation of transfiguration of transformation

together with every kind of mimicry and histrionic display at the same

time the essential feature remains the facility in transforming

the inability to refrain from reaction a similar state to that of

certain hysterical patients who at the slightest hint assume any

rle it is impossible for the dionysian artist not to understand any

suggestion no outward sign of emotion escapes him he possesses

the instinct of comprehension and of divination in the highest degree

just as he is capable of the most perfect art of communication he

enters into every skin into every passion he is continually changing

himself music as we understand it today is likewise a general

excitation and discharge of the emotions but notwithstanding this it

is only the remnant of a much richer world of emotional expression a

mere residuum of dionysian histrionism for music to be made possible

as a special art quite a number of senses and particularly the

muscular sense had to be paralysed at least relatively for all

rhythm still appeals to our muscles to a certain extent and thus man

no longer imitates and represents physically everything he feels as

soon as he feels it nevertheless that is the normal dionysian state

and in any case its primitive state music is the slowly attained

specialisation of this state at the cost of kindred capacities

the actor the mime the dancer the musician and the lyricist are

in their instincts fundamentally related but they have gradually

specialised in their particular branch and become separatedeven

to the point of contradiction the lyricist remained united with the

musician for the longest period of time and the actor with the dancer

the architect manifests neither a dionysian nor an apollonian state in

his case it is the great act of will the will that moveth mountains

the ecstasy of the great will which aspires to art the most powerful

men have always inspired architects the architect has always been

under the suggestion of power in the architectural structure mans

pride mans triumph over gravitation mans will to power assume

a visible form architecture is a sort of oratory of power by means

of forms now it is persuasive even flattering and at other times

merely commanding the highest sensation of power and security finds

expression in grandeur of style that power which no longer requires to

be proved which scorns to please which responds only with difficulty

which feels no witnesses around it which is oblivious of the fact

that it is being opposed which relies on itself fatalistically and

is a law among lawssuch power expresses itself quite naturally in

grandeur of style

i have been reading the life of thomas carlyle that unconscious and

involuntary farce that heroicomoral interpretation of dyspeptic

moodscarlyle a man of strong words and attitudes a rhetoricianpg 70 by

necessity who seems ever to be tormented by the desire of finding some

kind of strong faith and by his inability to do so in this respect

a typical romanticist to yearn for a strong faith is not the proof

of a strong faith but rather the reverse if a man have a strong faith

he can indulge in the luxury of scepticism he is strong enough firm

enough wellknit enough for such a luxury carlyle stupefies something

in himself by means of the fortissimo of his reverence for men of a

strong faith and his rage over those who are less foolish he is in

sore need of noise an attitude of constant and passionate dishonesty

towards himselfthis is his proprium by virtue of this he is and

remains interestingof course in england he is admired precisely

on account of his honesty well that is english and in view of the

fact that the english are the nation of consummate cant it is not only

comprehensible but also very natural at bottom carlyle is an english

atheist who makes it a point of honour not to be one

emersonhe is much more enlightened much broader more versatile

and more subtle than carlyle but above all he is happier he is one

who instinctively lives on ambrosia and who leaves the indigestible

parts of things on his plate compared with carlyle he is a man of

tastecarlyle who was very fond of him nevertheless declared that

he does not give us enough to chew this is perfectly true but

it is not unfavourable to emersonemerson possesses that kindly

intellectual cheerfulness which deprecates overmuch seriousness hepg 71

has absolutely no idea of how old he is already and how young he will

yet behe could have said of himself in lope de vegas words yo

me sucedo a mi mismo his mind is always finding reasons for being

contented and even thankful and at times he gets preciously near to

that serene superiority of the worthy bourgeois who returning from an

amorous rendezvous tamquam re bene gesta said gratefully ut desint

antidarwinas to the famous struggle for existence it seems to

me for the present to be more of an assumption than a fact it does

occur but as an exception the general condition of life is not one

of want or famine but rather of riches of lavish luxuriance and even

of absurd prodigalitywhere there is a struggle it is a struggle

for power we should not confound malthus with naturesupposing

however that this struggle existsand it does indeed occurits

result is unfortunately the very reverse of that which the darwinian

school seems to desire and of that which in agreement with them we

also might desire that is to say it is always to the disadvantage

of the strong the privileged and the happy exceptions species

do not evolve towards perfection the weak always prevail over the

strongsimply because they are the majority and because they are also

the more crafty darwin forgot the intellect that is english the

weak have more intellect in order to acquire intellect one must be in

need of it one loses it when one no longer needs it he who possesses

strengthpg 72 flings intellect to the deuce let it go hence2

say the germans of the present day the empire will remain

as you perceive intellect to me means caution patience craft

dissimulation great selfcontrol and everything related to mimicry

what is praised nowadays as virtue is very closely related the latter
15
casuistry of a psychologistthis man knows mankind to what purpose

does he study his fellows he wants to derive some small or even

great advantages from themhe is a politician that man yonder

is also well versed in human nature and ye tell me that he wishes to

draw no personal profit from his knowledge that he is a thoroughly

disinterested person examine him a little more closely maybe he

wishes to derive a more wicked advantage from his possession namely

to feel superior to men to be able to look down upon them no longer

to feel one of them this disinterested person is a despiser of

mankind and the former is of a more humane type whatever appearances

may seem to say to the contrary at least he considers himself the

equal of those about him at least he classifies himself with them
16
the psychological tact of germans seems to me to have been set in

doubt by a whole series of casespg 73 which my modesty forbids me to

enumerate in one case at least i shall not let the occasion slip

for substantiating my contention i bear the germans a grudge for

having made a mistake about kant and his backstairs philosophy as

i call it such a man was not the type of intellectual uprightness

another thing i hate to hear is a certain infamous and the germans

say goethe and schilleri even fear that they say schiller

and goethe  has nobody found schiller out yetbut there are

other ands which are even more egregious with my own ears i have

heardonly among university professors it is truemen speak of

schopenhauer and hartmann 3
17
the most intellectual men provided they are also the most courageous

experience the most excruciating tragedies but on that very account

they honour life because it confronts them with its most formidable

antagonism
18
concerning the conscience of the intellect nothing seems to me

more uncommon today than genuine hypocrisy i strongly suspect that

this growth is unable to flourish in the mild climate of our culture

hypocrisy belongs to an age of strong faithone in which one does

not lose ones own faith in spite of the fact that one has to make

anpg 74 outward show of holding another faith nowadays a man gives it

up or what is still more common he acquires a second faithin

any case however he remains honest without a doubt it is possible

to have a much larger number of convictions at present than it was

formerly possiblethat is to say allowablethat is to say

harmless from this there arises an attitude of toleration towards

ones self toleration towards ones self allows of a greater number

of convictions the latter live comfortably side by side and they

take jolly good care as all the world does today not to compromise

themselves how does a man compromise himself today when he is

consistent when he pursues a straight course when he has anything

less than five faces when he is genuine i very greatly fear that

modern man is much too fond of comfort for certain vices and the

consequence is that the latter are dying out everything evil which

is the outcome of strength of willand maybe there is nothing evil

without the strengh of willdegenerates in our muggy atmosphere

into virtue the few hypocrites i have known only imitated hypocrisy

like almost every tenth man today they were actors
19
beautiful and uglynothing is more relative let us say more

restricted than our sense of the beautiful he who would try to

divorce it from the delight man finds in his fellows would immediately

lose his footing beauty in itself is simply a word it is not even

a concept in the beautiful man postulates himself as the standard of

perfectionpg 75 in exceptional cases he worships himself as that standard

a species has no other alternative than to say yea to itself alone

in this way its lowest instinct the instinct of selfpreservation and

selfexpansion still radiates in such sublimities man imagines the

world itself to be overflowing with beautyhe forgets that he is the

cause of it all he alone has endowed it with beauty alas and only

with human alltoohuman beauty truth to tell man reflects himself in

things he thinks everything beautiful that throws his own image back

at him the judgment beautiful is the vanity of his species 

a little demon of suspicion may well whisper into the sceptics ear

is the world really beautified simply because man thinks it beautiful

he has only humanised itthat is all but nothing absolutely nothing

proves to us that it is precisely man who is the proper model of

beauty who knows what sort of figure he would cut in the eyes of a

higher judge of taste he might seem a little outr perhaps even

somewhat amusing perhaps a trifle arbitrary o dionysus thou divine

one why dost thou pull mine ears ariadne asks on one occasion of

her philosophic lover during one of those famous conversations on the

island of naxos i find a sort of humour in thine ears ariadne why

are they not a little longer
20
nothing is beautiful man alone is beautiful all sthetic rests on

this piece of ingenuousness it is the first axiom of this science

and now let us straightway add the second to it nothing is ugly save

thepg 76 degenerate manwithin these two first principles the realm of

sthetic judgments is confined from the physiological standpoint

everything ugly weakens and depresses man it reminds him of decay

danger impotence he literally loses strength in its presence the

effect of ugliness may be gauged by the dynamometer whenever mans

spirits are downcast it is a sign that he scents the proximity of

something ugly his feeling of power his will to power his courage

and his pridethese things collapse at the sight of what is ugly and

rise at the sight of what is beautiful in both cases an inference is

drawn the premises to which are stored with extra ordinary abundance

in the instincts ugliness is understood to signify a hint and a

symptom of degeneration that which reminds us however remotely of

degeneracy impels us to the judgment ugly every sign of exhaustion

of gravity of age of fatigue every kind of constraint such as

cramp or paralysis and above all the smells colours and forms

associated with decomposition and putrefaction however much they may

have been attenuated into symbolsall these things provoke the same

reaction which is the judgment ugly a certain hatred expresses

itself here what is it that man hates without a doubt it is the

decline of his type in this regard his hatred springs from the

deepest instincts of the race there is horror caution profundity and

farreaching vision in this hatredit is the most profound hatred

that exists on its account alone art is profound

schopenhauerschopenhauer the last german who is to be reckoned

with who is a european event like goethe hegel or heinrich heine

and who is not merely local national is for a psychologist a case

of the first rank i mean as a malicious though masterly attempt to

enlist on the side of a general nihilistic depreciation of life the

very forces which are opposed to such a movementthat is to say the

great selfaffirming powers of the will to live the exuberant forms

of life itself he interpreted art heroism genius beauty great

sympathy knowledge the will to truth and tragedy one after the

other as the results of the denial or of the need of the denial of

the willthe greatest forgery christianity always excepted which

history has to show examined more carefully he is in this respect

simply the heir of the christian interpretation except that he knew

how to approve in a christian fashion ie nihilistically even

of the great facts of human culture which christianity completely

repudiates he approved of them as paths to salvation as

preliminary stages to salvation as appetisers calculated to arouse

the desire for salvation
22
let me point to one single instance schopenhauer speaks of beauty with

melancholy ardourwhy in sooth does he do this because in beauty

he sees a bridge on which one can travel further or which stimulates

ones desire to travel further according to him it constitutes a

momentary emancipation frompg 78 the willit lures to eternal salvation

he values it more particularly as a deliverance from the burning core

of the will which is sexualityin beauty he recognises the negation

of the procreative instinct singular saint some one contradicts thee

i fear it is nature why is there beauty of tone colour aroma and

of rhythmic movement in nature at all what is it forces beauty to the

fore fortunately too a certain philosopher contradicts him no less

an authority than the divine plato himself thus does schopenhauer

call him upholds another proposition that all beauty lures to

procreationthat this precisely is the chief characteristic of its

effect from the lowest sensuality to the highest spirituality
23
plato goes further with an innocence for which a man must be greek

and not christian he says that there would be no such thing as

platonic philosophy if there were not such beautiful boys in athens

it was the sight of them alone that set the soul of the philosopher

reeling with erotic passion and allowed it no rest until it had

planted the seeds of all lofty things in a soil so beautiful he

was also a singular saintone scarcely believes ones ears even

supposing one believes plato at least one realises that philosophy was

pursued differently in athens above all publicly nothing is less

greek than the cobwebspinning with concepts by an anchorite amor

intellectualis dei after the fashion of spinoza philosophy according

to platos style might be defined rather as an erotic competition as a

continuation and a spiritualisation of the oldpg 79 agonal gymnastics and

the conditions on which they depend what was the ultimate outcome

of this philosophic eroticism of platos a new artform of the greek

agon dialecticsin opposition to schopenhauer and to the honour of

plato i would remind you that all the higher culture and literature of

classical france as well grew up on the soil of sexual interests in

all its manifestations you may look for gallantry the senses sexual

competition and woman and you will not look in vain

lart pour lartthe struggle against a purpose in art is always a

struggle against the moral tendency in art against its subordination

to morality lart pour lart means let morality go to the devil

but even this hostility betrays the preponderating power of the moral

prejudice if art is deprived of the purpose of preaching morality

and of improving mankind it does not by any means follow that art is

absolutely pointless purposeless senseless in short lart pour

larta snake which bites its own tail no purpose at all is better

than a moral purposethus does pure passion speak a psychologist

on the other hand puts the question what does all art do does it

not praise does it not glorify does it not select does it not

bring things into prominence in all this it strengthens or weakens

certain valuations is this only a secondary matter an accident

something in which the artists instinct has no share or is it not

rather the very prerequisite which enables the artist topg 80 accomplish

something is his most fundamental instinct concerned with art

is it not rather concerned with the purpose of art with life with

a certain desirable kind of life art is the great stimulus to life

how can it be regarded as purpose less as pointless as lart pour

lartthere still remains one question to be answered art also

reveals much that is ugly hard and questionable in lifedoes it

not thus seem to make life intolerableand as a matter of fact

there have been philosophers who have ascribed this function to art

according to schopenhauers doctrine the general object of art was to

free one from the will and what he honoured as the great utility

of tragedy was that it made people more resignedbut this as

i have already shown is a pessimistic standpoint it is the evil

eye the artist himself must be appealed to what is it that the soul

of the tragic artist communicates to others is it not precisely his

fearless attitude towards that which is terrible and questionable

this attitude is in itself a highly desirable one he who has once

experienced it honours it above everything else he communicates it he

must communicate provided he is an artist and a genius in the art of

communication a courageous and free spirit in the presence of a mighty

foe in the presence of a sublime misfortune and face to face with a

problem that inspires horrorthis is the triumphant attitude which

the tragic artist selects and which he glorifies the martial elements

in our soul celebrate their saturnalia in tragedy he who is used to

suffering he who looks out for suffering the heroic man extols his

existencepg 81 by means of tragedyto him alone does the tragic artist

offer this cup of sweetest cruelty

to associate in an amiable fashion with anybody to keep the house of

one can recognise the hearts that are capable of noble hospitality by

their wealth of screened windows and closed shutters they keep their

are somebodies
26
we no longer value ourselves sufficiently highly when we communicate

our souls content our real experiences are not at all garrulous they

could not communicate themselves even if they wished to they are at a

loss to find words for such confidences those things for which we find

words are things wehave already overcome in all speech there lies

an element of contempt speech it would seem was only invented for

emotional vice it may seem bitter to us and between ourselves we may

even laugh at the figure which it makes us cut but what does it matter

we have no other kind of selfcontrol left this is our asceticism our

manner of performing penance to become personalthe virtues of the

the immoralist speaksnothing is more distasteful to true

philosophers than man when he begins to wish if they see man only

at his deeds if they see this bravest craftiest and most enduring

of animals even inextricably entangled in disaster how admirable he

then appears to them they even encourage him but true philosophers

despise the man who wishes as also the desirable manand all the

desiderata and ideals of man in general if a philosopher could be a

nihilist he would be one for he finds only nonentity behind all human

ideals or not even nonentity but vileness absurdity sickness

cowardice fatigue and all sorts of dregs from out the quaffed goblets

of his life how is it that man who as a reality is so estimable

ceases from deserving respect the moment he begins to desire must he

pay for being so perfect as a reality must he make up for his deeds

for the tension of spirit and will which underlies all his deeds by an

eclipse of his powers in matters of the imagination and in absurdity

hitherto the history of his desires has been the partie honteuse of

mankind one should take care not to read too deeply in this history

that which justifies man is his realityit will justify him to all

eternity how much more valuable is a real man than any other man

who is merely the phantom of desires of dreams of stinks and of

liesthan any kind of ideal man  and the ideal man alone is

what the philosopher cannot abide

the natural value of egoismselfishness has as much value as the

physiological value of him who practises it its worth may be great

or it may be worthless and contemptible every individual may be

classified according to whether he represents the ascending or the

descending line of life when this is decided a canon is obtained

by means of which the value of his selfishness may be determined

if he represent the ascending line of life his value is of course

extraordinaryand for the sake of the collective life which in him

makes one step forward the concern about his maintenance about

procuring his optimum of conditions may even be extreme the human

unit the individual as the people and the philosopher have always

understood him is certainly an error he is nothing in himself no

atom no link in the chain no mere heritage from the pasthe

represents the whole direct line of mankind up to his own life

if he represent declining development decay chronic degeneration

sickness illnesses are on the whole already the outcome of decline

and not the cause thereof he is of little worth and the purest

equity would have him take away as little as possible from those who

are lucky strokes of nature he is then only a parasite upon them

the christian and the anarchistwhen the anarchist as the

mouthpiece of the decaying strata of society raises his voice in

splendid indignation for right justice equal rights he

is onlypg 86 groaning under the burden of his ignorance which cannot

understand why he actually sufferswhat his poverty consists

ofthe poverty of life an instinct of causality is active in

him someone must be responsible for his being so ill at ease his

splendid indignation alone relieves him somewhat it is a pleasure

for all poor devils to grumbleit gives them a little intoxicating

sensation of power the very act of complaining the mere fact that one

bewails ones lot may lend such a charm to life that on that account

alone one is ready to endure it there is a small dose of revenge in

every lamentation one casts ones afflictions and under certain

circumstances even ones baseness in the teeth of those who are

different as if their condition were an injustice an iniquitous

privilege since i am a blackguard you ought to be one too it is

upon such reasoning that revolutions are basedto bewail ones lot

is always despicable it is always the outcome of weakness whether

one ascribes ones afflictions to others or to ones self it is all

the same the socialist does the former the christian for instance

does the latter that which is common to both attitudes or rather

that which is equally ignoble in them both is the fact that somebody

must be to blame if one suffersin short that the sufferer drugs

himself with the honey of revenge to allay his anguish the objects

towards which this lust of vengeance like a lust of pleasure are

directed are purely accidental causes in all directions the sufferer

finds reasons for cooling his petty passion for revenge if he is a

christian i repeat he finds these reasons in himself the christian

and thepg 87 anarchistboth are decadents but even when the christian

condemns slanders and sullies the world he is actuated by precisely

the same instinct as that which leads the socialistic workman to curse

calumniate and cast dirt at society the last judgment itself is

still the sweetest solace to revengerevolution as the socialistic

workman expects it only thought of as a little more remote the

notion of a beyond as wellwhy a beyond if it be not a means of

splashing mud over a here over this world

a criticism of the morality of decadencean altruistic

morality a morality under which selfishness withers is in all

circumstances a bad sign this is true of individuals and above

all of nations the best are lacking when selfishness begins to be

lacking instinctively to select that which is harmful to one to be

lured by disinterested motivesthese things almost provide the

formula for decadence not to have ones own interests at heart

this is simply a moral figleaf concealing a very different fact a

physiological one to witi no longer know how to find what is to my

interest disintegration of the instinctsall is up with man when

he becomes altruisticinstead of saying ingenuously i am no longer

any good the lie of morality in the decadents mouth says nothing

is any goodlife is no gooda judgment of this kind ultimately

becomes a great danger for it is infectious and it soon flourishes

on the polluted soil of society with tropical luxuriance now as a

religion christianity anon as a philosophy schopenhauerismpg 88 in

certain circumstances the mere effluvia of such a venomous vegetation

springing as it does out of the very heart of putrefaction can poison

life for thousands and thousands of years
36
a moral for doctorsthe sick man is a parasite of society in

certain cases it is indecent to go on living to continue to vegetate

in a state of cowardly dependence upon doctors and special treatments

once the meaning of life the right to life has been lost ought to

be regarded with the greatest contempt by society the doctors for

their part should be the agents for imparting this contemptthey

should no longer prepare prescriptions but should every day administer

a fresh dose of disgust to their patients a new responsibility

should be created that of the doctorthe responsibility of ruthlessly

suppressing and eliminating degenerate life in all cases in which

the highest interests of life itself of ascending life demand such

a coursefor instance in favour of the right of procreation in

favour of the right of being born in favour of the right to live

one should die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly

death should be chosen freelydeath at the right time faced clearly

and joyfully and embraced while one is surrounded by ones children

and other witnesses it should be affected in such a way that a proper

farewell is still possible that he who is about to take leave of us

is still himself and really capable not only of valuing what he

has achieved and willed in life but also of summingup the value

of life itself everythingpg 89 precisely the opposite of the ghastly

comedy which christianity has made of the hour of death we should

never forgive christianity for having so abused the weakness of the

dying man as to do violence to his conscience or for having used

his manner of dying as a means of valuing both man and his pastin

spite of all cowardly prejudices it is our duty in this respect

above all to reinstate the properthat is to say the physiological

aspect of socalled natural death which after all is perfectly

unnatural and nothing else than suicide one never perishes through

anybodys fault but ones own the only thing is that the death which

takes place in the most contemptible circumstances the death that

is not free the death which occurs at the wrong time is the death

of a coward out of the very love one bears to life one should wish

death to be different from thisthat is to say free deliberate and

neither a matter of chance nor of surprise finally let me whisper a

word of advice to our friends the pessimists and all other decadents

we have not the power to prevent ourselves from being born but this

errorfor sometimes it is an errorcan be rectified if we choose the

man who does away with himself performs the most estimable of deeds

he almost deserves to live for having done so societynay life

itself derives more profit from such a deed than from any sort of life

spent in renunciation anmia and other virtuesat least the suicide

frees others from the sight of him at least he removes one objection

against life pessimism pur et vert can be proved only by the

selfrefutation of the pessimists themselves one should go a step

further in onespg 90 consistency one should not merely deny life with

the world as will and idea as schopenhauer did one should in the

first place deny schopenhauer  incidentally pessimism however

infectious it may be does not increase the morbidness of an age or of

a whole species it is rather the expression of that morbidness one

falls a victim to it in the same way as one falls a victim to cholera

one must already be predisposed to the disease pessimism in itself

does not increase the number of the worlds decadents by a single

unit let me remind you of the statistical fact that in those years in

which cholera rages the total number of deaths does not exceed that of

other years
37
have we become more moralas might have been expected the whole

ferocity of moral stultification which as is well known passes

for morality itself in germany hurled itself against my concept

beyond good and evil i could tell you some nice tales about this

above all people tried to make me see the incontestable superiority

of our age in regard to moral sentiment and the progress we had

made in these matters compared with us a csar borgia was by no

means to be represented as higher man the sort of superman

which i declared him to be the editor of the swiss paper the bund

went so far as not only to express his admiration for the courage

displayed by my enterprise but also to pretend to understand that

the intended purpose of my work was to abolish all decent feeling

much obligedin reply i venture to raise the following questionpg 91
have we really become more moral the fact that everybody believes

that we have is already an objection to the belief we modern men

so extremely delicate and susceptible full of consideration one for

the other actually dare to suppose that the pampering fellowfeeling

which we all display this unanimity which we have at last acquired

in sparing and helping and trusting one another marks a definite step

forward and shows us to be far ahead of the man of the renaissance

but every age thinks the same it is bound to think the same this

at least is certain that we should not dare to stand amid the

conditions which prevailed at the renaissance we should not even dare

to imagine ourselves in those conditions our nerves could not endure

that reality not to speak of our muscles the inability to do this

however does not denote any progress but simply the different and

more senile quality of our particular nature its greater weakness

delicateness and susceptibility out of which a morality more rich

in consideration was bound to arise if we imagine our delicateness

and senility our physiological decrepitude as nonexistent our

morality of humanisation would immediately lose all valueno

morality has any value per seit would even fill us with scorn on

the other hand do not let us doubt that we moderns wrapped as we are

in the thick cotton wool of our humanitarianism which would shrink

even from grazing a stone would present a comedy to csar borgias

contemporaries which would literally make them die of laughter we are

indeed without knowing it exceedingly ridiculous with our modern

virtues  the decline of thepg 92 instincts of hostility and of

those instincts that arouse suspicionfor this if anything is what

constitutes our progressis only one of the results manifested by

the general decline in vitality it requires a hundred times more

trouble and caution to live such a dependent and senile existence

in such circumstances everybody gives everybody else a helping hand

and to a certain extent everybody is either an invalid or an

invalids attendant this is then called virtue among those men

who knew a different lifethat is to say a fuller more prodigal

more superabundant sort of life it might have been called by another

namepossibly cowardice or vileness or old womans morality

 our mollification of moralsthis is my cry this it you will is

my innovationis the outcome of our decline conversely hardness

and terribleness in morals may be the result of a surplus of life

when the latter state prevails much is dared much is challenged

and much is also squandered that which formerly was simply the

salt of life would now be our poison to be indifferenteven this

is a form of strengthfor that likewise we are too senile too

decrepit our morality of fellowfeeling against which i was the

first to raise a finger of warning that which might be called moral

impressionism is one symptom the more of the excessive physiological

irritability which is peculiar to everything decadent that movement

which attempted to introduce itself in a scientific manner on the

shoulders of schopenhauers morality of pitya very sad attemptis

in its essence the movement of decadence in morality and as such

it is intimately related to christian morality strongpg 93 ages and

noble cultures see something contemptible in pity in the love of

ones neighbour and in a lack of egoism and of selfesteemages

should be measured according to their positive forcesvalued

by this standard that prodigal and fateful age of the renaissance

appears as the last great age while we moderns with our anxious

care of ourselves and love of our neighbours with all our unassuming

virtues of industry equity and scientific methodwith our lust of

collection of economy and of mechanismrepresent a weak age

our virtues are necessarily determined and are even stimulated by our

weakness equality a certain definite process of making everybody

uniform which only finds its expression in the theory of equal rights

is essentially bound up with a declining culture the chasm between

man and man class and class the multiplicity of types the will to

be ones self and to distinguish ones selfthat in fact which i

call the pathos of distance is proper to all strong ages the force

of tensionnay the tension itself between extremes grows slighter

every daythe extremes themselves are tending to become obliterated

to the point of becoming identical all our political theories and

state constitutions not by any means excepting the german empire

are the logical consequences the necessary consequences of decline

the unconscious effect of decadence has begun to dominate even the

ideals of the various sciences my objection to the whole of english

and french sociology still continues to be this that it knows only

the decadent form of society from experience and with perfectly

childlike innocence takes the instincts of decline as the normpg 94 the

standard of sociological valuations descending life the decay

of all organising powerthat is to say of all that power which

separates cleaves gulfs and establishes rank above and below

formulated itself in modern sociology as the ideal our socialists

are decadents but herbert spencer was also a decadenthe saw

something to be desired in the triumph of altruism
38
my concept of freedomsometimes the value of a thing does not lie

in that which it helps us to achieve but in the amount we have to

pay for itwhat it costs us for instance liberal institutions

straightway cease from being liberal the moment they are soundly

established once this is attained no more grievous and more thorough

enemies of freedom exist than liberal institutions one knows of

course what they bring about they undermine the will to power

they are the levelling of mountain and valley exalted to a morality

they make people small cowardly and pleasurelovingby means of

them the gregarious animal invariably triumphs liberalism or in

plain english the transformation of mankind into cattle the

same institutions so long as they are fought for produce quite

other results then indeed they promote the cause of freedom quite

powerfully regarded more closely it is war which produces these

results war in favour of liberal institutions which as war allows

the illiberal instincts to subsist for war trains men to be free

what in sooth is freedom freedom is the will to be responsible

for ourselves it is to preserve thepg 95 distance which separates us

from other men to grow more indifferent to hardship to severity

to privation and even to life itself to be ready to sacrifice

men for ones cause ones self included freedom denotes that the

virile instincts which rejoice in war and in victory prevail over

other instincts for instance over the instincts of happiness

the man who has won his freedom and how much more so therefore

the spirit that has won its freedom tramples ruthlessly upon that

contemptible kind of comfort which teagrocers christians cows

women englishmen and other democrats worship in their dreams the

free man is a warriorhow is freedom measured in individuals

as well as in nations according to the resistance which has to be

overcome according to the pains which it costs to remain uppermost

the highest type of free man would have to be sought where the

greatest resistance has continually to be overcome five paces away

from tyranny on the very threshold of the danger of thraldom this

is psychologically true if by the word tyrants we mean inexorable

and terrible instincts which challenge the maximum amount of

authority and discipline to oppose themthe finest example of this

is julius csar it is also true politically just examine the course

of history the nations which were worth anything which got to

be worth anything never attained to that condition under liberal

institutions great danger made out of them something which deserves

reverence that danger which alone can make us aware of our resources

our virtues our means of defence our weapons our geniuswhich

compels us to be strongpg 96 first principle a man must need to be

strong otherwise he will never attain itthose great forcinghouses

of the strong of the strongest kind of men that have ever existed on

earth the aristocratic communities like those of rome and venice

understood freedom precisely as i understand the word as something

that one has and that one has not as something that one will have

and that one seizes by force
39
a criticism of modernityour institutions are no longer any good

on this point we are all agreed but the fault does not lie with

them but with us now that we have lost all the instincts out

of which institutions grow the latter on their part are beginning

to disappear from our midst because we are no longer fit for them

democracy has always been the death agony of the power of organisation

already in human alltoohuman part i aph 472 i pointed out

that modern democracy together with its halfmeasures of which the

german empire is an example was a decaying form of the state for

institutions to be possible there must exist a sort of will instinct

imperative which cannot be otherwise than antiliberal to the point of

wickedness the will to tradition to authority to responsibility

for centuries to come to solidarity in long family lines forwards

and backwards in infinitum if this will is present something is

founded which resembles the imperium romanum or russia the only

great nation today that has some lasting power and grit in her that

can bide her time that can still promise somethingrussia the

opposite of allpg 97 wretched european pettystatism and neurasthenia

which the foundation of the german empire has brought to a crisis the

whole of the occident no longer possesses those instincts from which

institutions spring out of which a future grows maybe nothing is

more opposed to its modern spirit than these things people live

for the present the live at top speedthey certainly live without

any sense of responsibility and this is precisely what they call

freedom everything in institutions which makes them institutions

is scorned loathed and repudiated everybody is in mortal fear of a

new slavery wherever the word authority is so much as whispered

the decadence of the valuing instinct both in our politicians and in

our political parties goes so far that they instinctively prefer

that which acts as a solvent that which precipitates the final

catastrophe as an example of this behold modern marriage all

reason has obviously been divorced from modern marriage but this is

no objection to matrimony itself but to modernity the rational basis

of marriageit lay in the exclusive legal responsibility of the man

by this means some ballast was laid in the ship of matrimony whereas

nowadays it has a list now on this side now on that the rational

basis of marriageit lay in its absolute indissolubleness in this way

it was given a gravity which knew how to make its influence felt in

the face of the accident of sentiment passion and momentary impulse

it lay also in the fact that the responsibility of choosing the parties

to the contract lay with the families by showing ever more and more

favour to lovemarriages the very foundationpg 98 of matrimony that which

alone makes it an institution has been undermined no institution

ever has been nor ever will be built upon an idiosyncrasy as i say

marriage cannot be based upon love it can be based upon sexual

desire upon the instinct of property wife and child as possessions

upon the instinct of dominion which constantly organises for itself

the smallest form of dominionthe family which requires children

and heirs in order to hold fast also in the physiological sense to

a certain quantum of acquired power influence and wealth so as to

prepare for lasting tasks and for solidarity in the instincts from

one century to another marriage as an institution presupposes the

affirmation of the greatest and most permanent form of organisation if

society cannot as a whole stand security for itself into the remotest

generations marriage has no meaning whatsoevermodern marriage has

lost its meaning consequently it is being abolished
40
the question of the workingmanthe mere fact that there is such

a thing as the question of the workingman is due to stupidity or at

bottom to degenerate instincts which are the cause of all the stupidity

of modern times concerning certain things no questions ought to be

put the first imperative principle of instinct for the life of me

i cannot see what people want to do with the workingman of europe

now that they have made a question of him he is far too comfortable

to cease from questioning ever more and more and with ever less

modesty after all he has the majority on his sidepg 99 there is now

not the slightest hope that an unassuming and contented sort of man

after the style of the chinaman will come into being in this quarter

and this would have been the reasonable course it was even a dire

necessity what has been done everything has been done with the view

of nipping the very prerequisite of this accomplishment in the bud

with the most frivolous thoughtlessness those selfsame instincts by

means of which a workingclass becomes possible and tolerable even

to its members themselves have been destroyed root and branch the

workingman has been declared fit for military service he has been

granted the right of combination and of voting can it be wondered at

that he already regards his condition as one of distress expressed

morally as an injustice but again i ask what do people want if

they desire a certain end then they should desire the means thereto

if they will have slaves then it is madness to educate them to be

masters
41
the kind of freedom i do not mean6in an age like the

present it simply adds to ones perils to be left to ones instincts

the instincts contradict disturb and destroy each other i have

already defined modernism as physiological selfcontradiction a

reasonable system of education would insist upon at least one of

these instinctsystems being paralysed beneath an iron pressure in

order topg 100 allow others to assert their power to grow strong and to

dominate at present the only conceivable way of making the individual

possible would be to prune himof making him possiblethat is to

say whole the very reverse occurs independence free development

and laisser aller are clamoured for most violently precisely by

those for whom no restraint could be too severethis is true in

politics it is true in art but this is a symptom of decadence our

modern notion of freedom is one proof the more of the degeneration of

instinct
42
where faith is necessarynothing is more rare among moralists and

saints than uprightness maybe they say the reverse is true maybe

they even believe it for when faith is more useful more effective

more convincing than conscious hypocrisy by instinct that hypocrisy

forthwith becomes innocent first principle towards the understanding

of great saints the same holds good of philosophers that other order

of saints their whole business compels them to concede only certain

truthsthat is to say those by means of which their particular trade

receives the public sanctionto speak kantingly the truths of

practical reason they know what they must prove in this respect

they are practicalthey recognise each other by the fact that

they agree upon certain truthsthou shalt not liein plain

englishbeware mr philosopher of speaking the truth
pg 101
43
a quiet hint to conservativesthat which we did not know

formerly and know now or might know if we choseis the fact that

a retrograde formation a reversion in any sense or degree is

absolutely impossible we physiologists at least are aware of this

but all priests and moralists have believed in itthey wished to

drag and screw man back to a former standard of virtue morality has

always been a procrustean bed even the politicians have imitated

the preachers of virtue in this matter there are parties at the

present day whose one aim and dream is to make all things adopt the

crabmarch but not everyone can be a crab it cannot be helped we

must go forwardthat is to say step by step further and further into

decadence this is my definition of modern progress we can hinder

this development and by so doing dam up and accumulate degeneration

itself and render it more convulsive more volcanic we cannot do

more
44
my concept of geniusgreat men like great ages are explosive

material in which a stupendous amount of power is accumulated

the first conditions of their existence are always historical and

physiological they are the outcome of the fact that for long ages

energy has been collected hoarded up saved up and preserved for their

use and that no explosion has taken place when the tension in the

bulk has become sufficiently excessive the most fortuitous stimulus

suffices in order to call geniuspg 102 great deeds and momentous

fate into the world what then is the good of all environment

historical periods zeitgeist spirit of the age and public

opiniontake the case of napoleon france of the revolution

and still more of the period preceding the revolution would have

brought forward a type which was the very reverse of napoleon it

actually did produce such a type and because napoleon was something

different the heir of a stronger more lasting and older civilisation

than that which in france was being smashed to atoms he became master

there he was the only master there great men are necessary the age

in which they appear is a matter of chance the fact that they almost

invariably master their age is accounted for simply by the fact that

they are stronger that they are older and that power has been stored

longer for them the relation of a genius to his age is that which

exists between strength and weakness and between maturity and youth

the age is relatively always very much younger thinner less mature

less resolute and more childish the fact that the general opinion in

france at the present day is utterly different on this very point in

germany too but that is of no consequence the fact that in that

country the theory of environmenta regular neuropathic notionhas

become sacrosanct and almost scientific and finds acceptance even

among the physiologists is a very bad and exceedingly depressing

sign in england too the same belief prevails but nobody will be

surprised at that the englishman knows only two ways of understanding

the genius and the great man either democratically in the style

ofpg 103 buckle or religiously after the manner of carlylethe danger

which great men and great ages represent is simply extraordinary

every kind of exhaustion and of sterility follows in their wake the

great man is an end the great agethe renaissance for instanceis

an end the geniusin work and in deedis necessarily a squanderer

the fact that he spends himself constitutes his greatness the instinct

of selfpreservation is as it were suspended in him the overpowering

pressure of outflowing energy in him forbids any such protection and

prudence people call this selfsacrifice they praise his heroism

his indifference to his own wellbeing his utter devotion to an idea

a great cause a fatherland all misunderstandings he flows out

he flows over he consumes himself he does not spare himselfand

does all this with fateful necessity irrevocably involuntarily just

as a river involuntarily bursts its dams but owing to the fact that

humanity has been much indebted to such explosives it has endowed them

with many things for instance with a kind of higher morality

this is indeed the sort of gratitude that humanity is capable of it

misunderstands its benefactors

the criminal and his likethe criminal type is the type of the

strong man amid unfavourable conditions a strong man made sick he

lacks the wild and savage state a form of nature and existence which

is freer and more dangerous in which everything that constitutes

the shield and the sword inpg 104 the instinct of the strong man takes

a place by right society puts a ban upon his virtues the most

spirited instincts inherent in him immediately become involved with

the depressing passions with suspicion fear and dishonour but this

is almost the recipe for physiological degeneration when a man has

to do that which he is best suited to do which he is most fond of

doing not only clandestinely but also with long suspense caution and

ruse he becomes anmic and inasmuch as he is always having to pay

for his instincts in the form of danger persecution and fatalities

even his feelings begin to turn against these instinctshe begins to

regard them as fatal it is society our tame mediocre castrated

society in which an untutored son of nature who comes to us from his

mountains or from his adventures at sea must necessarily degenerate

into a criminal or almost necessarily for there are cases in which

such a man shows himself to be stronger than society the corsican

napoleon is the most celebrated case of this concerning the problem

before us dostoiewskys testimony is of importancedostoiewsky who

incidentally was the only psychologist from whom i had anything

to learn he belongs to the happiest windfalls of my life happier

even than the discovery of stendhal this profound man who was

right ten times over in esteeming the superficial germans low found

the siberian convicts among whom he lived for many yearsthose

thoroughly hopeless criminals for whom no road back to society stood

openvery different from what even he had expectedthat is to say

carved from about the best hardest and mostpg 105 valuable material that

grows on russian soil7 let us generalise the case of the criminal

let us imagine creatures who for some reason or other fail to meet

with public approval who know that they are regarded neither as

beneficent nor usefulthe feeling of the chandala who are aware

that they are not looked upon as equal but as proscribed unworthy

polluted the thoughts and actions of all such natures are tainted

with a subterranean mouldiness everything in them is of a paler hue

than in those on whose existence the sun shines but almost all those

creatures whom nowadays we honour and respect formerly lived in this

semisepulchral atmosphere the man of science the artist the genius

the free spirit the actor the business man and the great explorer

as long as the priest represented the highest type of man every

valuable kind of man was depreciated the time is comingthis i

guaranteewhen he will pass as the lowest type as our chandala as

the falsest and most disreputable kind of man i call your attention

to the fact that even now under the sway of the mildest customs and

usages which have ever ruled on earth or at least in europe every

form of standing aside every kind of prolonged excessively prolonged

concealment every unaccustomed and obscure form of existence tends to

approximate to that type which the criminal exemplifies to perfection

all pioneers of the spirit have for a while the grey and fatalistic

mark of the chandala on their brows not because they are regarded as

chandala but because theypg 106 themselves feel the terrible chasm which

separates them from all that is traditional and honourable almost

every genius knows the catilinarian life as one of the stages in his

development a feeling of hate revenge and revolt against everything

that exists that has ceased to evolve catilinethe early stage of

beauty no accidenteven the beauty of a race or of a family

the charm and perfection of all its movements is attained with

pains like genius it is the final result of the accumulated work

of generations great sacrifices must have been made on the altar

ol good taste for its sake many things must have been done and

much must have been left undonethe seventeenth century in france

is admirable for both ofpg 107 these thingsin this century there must

have been a principle of selection in respect to company locality

clothing the gratification of the instinct of sex beauty must have

been preferred to profit to habit to opinion and to indolence the

first rule of allnobody must let himself go not even when he is

alonegood things are exceedingly costly and in all cases the law

obtains that he who possesses them is a different person from him who

is acquiring them everything good is an inheritance that which is

not inherited is imperfect it is simply a beginning in athens at

the time of cicerowho expresses his surprise at the factthe men

and youths were by far superior in beauty to the women but what hard

work and exertions the male sex had for centuries imposed upon itself

in the service of beauty we must not be mistaken in regard to the

method employed here the mere discipline of feelings and thoughts

is little better than nil it is in this that the great error of

german culture which is quite illusory lies the body must be

persuaded first the strict maintenance of a distinguished and tasteful

demeanour the obligation of frequenting only those who do not let

themselves go is amply sufficient to render one distinguished and

tasteful in two or three generations everything has already taken

deep root the fate of a people and of humanity is decided according

to whether they begin culture at the right placenot at the soul

as the fatal superstition of the priests and halfpriests would have

it the right place is the body demeanour diet physiologythe rest

follows as the night the day that is why the greeks remain the

christianity with its contempt of the body is the greatest mishap that

has ever befallen mankind

progress in my sensei also speak of a return to nature although

it is not a process of going back but of going upup into lofty free

and even terrible nature and naturalness such a nature as can play

with great tasks and may play with them to speak in a parable

napoleon was an example of a return to nature as i understand it

for instance in rebus tacticis and still more as military experts

know in strategy but rousseauwhither did he want to return

rousseau this first modern man idealist and canaille in one person

who was in need of moral dignity in order even to endure the sight

of his own personill with unbridled vanity and wanton selfcontempt

this abortion who planted his tent on the threshold of modernity

also wanted a return to nature but i ask once more whither did

he wish to return i hate rousseau even in the revolution itself

the latter was the historical expression of this hybrid of idealist

and canaille the bloody farce which this revolution ultimately

became its immorality concerns me but slightly what i loathe

however is its rousseauesque moralitythe socalled truths of the

revolution by means of which it still exercises power and draws all

flat and mediocre things over to its side the doctrine of equality

 but there is no more deadly poison than this for it seems to

proceed from the very lips of justice whereas in reality it draws

the curtainpg 109 down on all justice to equals equality to unequals

inequalitythat would be the real speech of justice and that which

follows from it never make unequal things equal the fact that so

much horror and blood are associated with this doctrine of equality

has lent this modern idea par excellence such a halo of fire and

glory that the revolution as a drama has misled even the most noble

mindsthat after all is no reason for honouring it the morei can

see only one who regarded it as it should be regardedthat is to say

with loathing i speak of goethe
49
goetheno mere german but a european event a magnificent attempt

to overcome the eighteenth century by means of a return to nature by

means of an ascent to the naturalness of the renaissance a kind of

selfovercoming on the part of the century in questionhe bore the

strongest instincts of this century in his breast its sentimentality

and idolatry of nature its antihistoric idealistic unreal and

revolutionary spirit the latter is only a form of the unreal he

enlisted history natural science antiquity as well as spinoza and

above all practical activity in his service he drew a host of very

definite horizons around him far from liberating himself from life he

plunged right into it he did not give in he took as much as he could

on his own shoulders and into his heart that to which he aspired was

totality he was opposed to the sundering of reason sensuality

feeling and will as preached with most repulsive scholasticism

by kant the antipodes of goethe he disciplined himself into a

harmonious whole he created himself goethe in thepg 110 midst of an age

of unreal sentiment was a convinced realist he said yea to everything

that was like him in this regardthere was no greater event in his

life than that ens realissimum surnamed napoleon goethe conceived

a strong highlycultured man skilful in all bodily accomplishments

able to keep himself in check having a feeling of reverence for

himself and so constituted as to be able to risk the full enjoyment

of naturalness in all its rich profusion and be strong enough for this

freedom a man of tolerance not out of weakness but out of strength

because he knows how to turn to his own profit that which would ruin

the mediocre nature a man unto whom nothing is any longer forbidden

unless it be weakness either as a vice or as a virtue such a spirit

become free appears in the middle of the universe with a feeling

of cheerful and confident fatalism he believes that only individual

things are bad and that as a whole the universe justifies and affirms

itselfhe no longer denies but such a faith is the highest of

all faiths i christened it with the name of dionysus
50
it might be said that in a certain sense the nineteenth century

also strove after all that goethe himself aspired to catholicity in

understanding in approving a certain reserve towards everything

daring realism and a reverence for every fact how is it that

the total result of this is not a goethe but a state of chaos a

nihilistic groan an inability to discover where one is an instinct

of fatigue which in praxi is persistently driving europe to hark

back to the eighteenth century for instance in the form of maudlin

romanticism altruism hypersentimentalitypg 111 pessimism in taste

and socialism in politics is not the nineteenth century at least

in its closing years merely an accentuated brutalised eighteenth

centurythat is to say a century of decadence and has not goethe

beennot alone for germany but also for the whole of europemerely

an episode a beautiful in vain but great men are misunderstood when

they are regarded from the wretched standpoint of public utility the

fact that no advantage can be derived from themthis in itself may

perhaps be peculiar to greatness

about a certain degree of immortalitynever have i been modest enough

to demand less of myself the aphorism the sentence in both of

else says in a whole bookwhat everyone else does not say in a

 things i owe to the ancients
1
in conclusion i will just say a word concerning that world to which i

have sought new means of access to which i may perhaps have found a

new passagethe ancient world my taste which is perhaps the reverse

of tolerant is very far from saying yea through and through even to

this world on the whole it is not over eager to say yea it would

prefer to say nay and better still nothing whatever this is true

of whole cultures it is true of booksit is also true of places

and of landscapes truth to tell the number of ancient books that

count for something in my life is but small and the most famous are

not of that number my sense of style for the epigram as style was

awakened almost spontaneously upon my acquaintance with sallust i have

not forgotten the astonishment of my respected teacher corssen when

he was forced to give his worst latin pupil the highest marksat one

stroke i had learned all there was to learn condensed severe with as

much substance as possible in the background and with cold but roguish

hostility towards all beautiful words and beautiful feelingsin

these things i found my own particular bent in my writings up to my

zarathustra there will be found a very earnest ambition to attain

to the roman style topg 113 the re perennius in stylethe same

thing happened on my first acquaintance with horace up to the present

no poet has given me the same artistic raptures as those which from

the first i received from an horatian ode in certain languages it

would be absurd even to aspire to what is accomplished by this poet

this mosaic of words in which every unit spreads its power to the

left and to the right over the whole by its sound by its place in

the sentence and by its meaning this minimum in the compass and

number of the signs and the maximum of energy in the signs which is

thereby achievedall this is roman and if you will believe me noble

par excellence by the side of this all the rest of poetry becomes

something popularnothing more than senseless sentimental twaddle
2
i am not indebted to the greeks for anything like such strong

impressions and to speak frankly they cannot be to us what the

romans are one cannot learn from the greekstheir style is too

strange it is also too fluid to be imperative or to have the effect

of a classic who would ever have learnt writing from a greek who

would ever have learned it without the romans do not let anyone

suggest plato to me in regard to plato i am a thorough sceptic and

have never been able to agree to the admiration of plato the artist

which is traditional among scholars and after all in this matter

the most refined judges of taste in antiquity are on my side in my

opinion plato bundles all the forms of style pellmell together

in this respect he is onepg 114 of the first decadents of style he has

something similar on his conscience to that which the cynics had

who invented the satura menippea for the platonic dialoguethis

revoltingly selfcomplacent and childish kind of dialecticsto

exercise any charm over you you must never have read any good french

authorsfontenelle for instance plato is boring in reality my

distrust of plato is fundamental i find him so very much astray

from all the deepest instincts of the hellenes so steeped in moral

prejudices so preexistently christianthe concept good is already

the highest value with himthat rather than use any other expression

i would prefer to designate the whole phenomenon plato with the hard

word superior bunkum or if you would like it better idealism

humanity has had to pay dearly for this athenian having gone to school

among the egyptians or among the jews in egypt in the great

fatality of christianity plato is that doublefaced fascination

called the ideal which made it possible for the more noble natures

of antiquity to misunderstand themselves and to tread the bridge

which led to the cross and what an amount of plato is still to be

found in the concept church and in the construction the system

and the practice of the churchmy recreation my predilection my

cure after all platonism has always been thucydides thucydides and

perhaps machiavellis principe are most closely related to me owing

to the absolute determination which they show of refusing to deceive

themselves and of seeing reason in realitynot in rationality

and still less in morality there is no more radical cure than

thucydides for the lamentablypg 115 rosecoloured idealisation of the

greeks which the classicallycultured stripling bears with him into

life as a reward for his public school training his writings must be

carefully studied line by line and his unuttered thoughts must be read

as distinctly as what he actually says there are few thinkers so rich

in unuttered thoughts in him the culture of the sophiststhat is to

say the culture of realism receives its most perfect expression this

inestimable movement in the midst of the moral and idealistic knavery

of the socratic schools which was then breaking out in all directions

greek philosophy is the decadence of the greek instinct thucydides is

the great summing up the final manifestation of that strong severe

positivism which lay in the instincts of the ancient hellene after

all it is courage in the face of reality that distinguishes such

natures as thucydides from plato plato is a coward in the face of

realityconsequently he takes refuge in the ideal thucydides is

master of himselfconsequently he is able to master life

to rout up cases of beautiful souls golden means and other

perfections among the greeks to admire say their calm grandeur

their ideal attitude of mind their exalted simplicityfrom this

exalted simplicity which after all is a piece of niaiserie

allemande i was preserved by the psychologist within me i saw their

strongest instinct the will to power i saw them quivering with the

fierce violence of this instincti saw all their institutions grow

out of measures of security calculated to preservepg 116 each member of

their society from the inner explosive material that lay in his

neighbours breast this enormous internal tension thus discharged

itself in terrible and reckless hostility outside the state the

various states mutually tore each other to bits in order that each

individual state could remain at peace with itself it was then

necessary to be strong for danger lay close at handit lurked in

ambush everywhere the superb suppleness of their bodies the daring

realism and immorality which is peculiar to the hellenes was a

necessity not an inherent quality it was a result it had not been

there from the beginning even their festivals and their arts were but

means in producing a feeling of superiority and of showing it they

are measures of selfglorification and in certain circumstances of

making ones self terrible fancy judging the greeks in the german

style from their philosophers fancy using the suburban respectability

of the socratic schools as a key to what is fundamentally hellenic

the philosophers are of course the decadents of hellas the

countermovement directed against the old and noble tasteagainst the

agonal instinct against the polls against the value of the race

against the authority of tradition socratic virtues were preached to

the greeks because the greeks had lost virtue irritable cowardly

unsteady and all turned to playactors they had more than sufficient

reason to submit to having morality preached to them not that it

helped them in any way but great words and attitudes are so becoming

to decadents

i was the first who in order to understand the ancient still rich and

even superabundant hellenic instinct took that marvellous phenomenon

which bears the name of dionysus seriously it can be explained only

as a manifestation of excessive energy whoever had studied the greeks

as that most profound of modern connoisseurs of their culture jakob

burckhardt of ble had done knew at once that something had been

achieved by means of this interpretation and in his cultur der

griechen burckhardt inserted a special chapter on the phenomenon

in question if you would like a glimpse of the other side you have

only to refer to the almost laughable poverty of instinct among german

philologists when they approach the dionysian question the celebrated

lobeck especially who with the venerable assurance of a worm dried up

between books crawled into this world of mysterious states succeeded

inconvincing himself that he was scientific whereas he was simply

revoltingly superficial and childishlobeck with all the pomp of

profound erudition gave us to understand that as a matter of fact

there was nothing at all in all these curiosities truth to tell the

priests may well have communicated not a few things of value to the

participators in such orgies for instance the fact that wine provokes

desire that man in certain circumstances lives on fruit that plants

bloom in the spring and fade in the autumn as regards the astounding

wealth of rites symbols and myths which take their origin in the orgy

and with which the world of antiquitypg 118 is literally smothered lobeck

finds that it prompts him to a feat of even greater ingenuity than

the foregoing phenomenon did the greeks he says aglaophamus

i p 672 when they had nothing better to do laughed sprang and

romped about or inasmuch as men also like a change at times they

would sit down weep and bewail their lot others then came up who tried

to discover some reason for this strange behaviour and thus as an

explanation of these habits there arose an incalculable number of

festivals legends and myths on the other hand it was believed that

the farcical performances which then perchance began to take place

on festival days necessarily formed part of the celebrations and

they were retained as an indispensable part of the ritualthis is

contemptible nonsense and no one will take a man like lobeck seriously

for a moment we are very differently affected when we examine the

notion hellenic as winckelmann and goethe conceived it and find it

incompatible with that element out of which dionysian art springsi

speak of orgiasm in reality i do not doubt that goethe would have

completely excluded any such thing from the potentialities of the greek

soul consequently goethe did not understand the greeks for it is

only in the dionysian mysteries in the psychology of the dionysian

state that the fundamental fact of the hellenic instinctits will

to lifeis expressed what did the hellene secure himself with these

mysteries eternal life the eternal recurrence of life the future

promised and hallowed in the past the triumphant yea to life despite

death and change real life conceived as the collective prolongation

ofpg 119 life through procreation through the mysteries of sexuality

to the greeks the symbol of sex was the most venerated of symbols

the really deep significance of all the piety of antiquity all the

details of the act of procreation pregnancy and birth gave rise to

the loftiest and most solemn feelings in the doctrine of mysteries

pain was pronounced holy the pains of childbirth sanctify pain in

generalall becoming and all growth everything that guarantees the

future involves pain in order that there may be eternal joy in

creating in order that the will to life may say yea to itself in all

eternity the pains of childbirth must also be eternal all this is

what the word dionysus signifies i know of no higher symbolism than

this greek symbolism this symbolism of the dionysian phenomenon in

it the profoundest instinct of life the instinct that guarantees the

future of life and life eternal is understood religiouslythe road

to life itself procreation is pronounced holy  it was only

christianity which with its fundamental resentment against life made

something impure out of sexuality it flung filth at the very basis

the very first condition of our life
5
the psychology of orgiasm conceived as the feeling of a superabundance

of vitality and strength within the scope of which even pain acts

as a stimulus gave me the key to the concept tragic feeling

which has been misunderstood not only by aristotle but also even

more by our pessimists tragedy is so far from proving anything in

regard to the pessimism ofpg 120 the greeks as schopenhauer maintains

that it ought rather to be considered as the categorical repudiation

and condemnation thereof the saying of yea to life including

even its most strange and most terrible problems the will to life

rejoicing over its own inexhaustibleness in the sacrifice of its

highest typesthis is what i called dionysian this is what i

divined as the bridge leading to the psychology of the tragic poet

not in order to escape from terror and pity not to purify ones self

of a dangerous passion by discharging it with vehemencethis is how

aristotle understood itbut to be far beyond terror and pity and to

be the eternal lust of becoming itselfthat lust which also involves

the lust of destruction and with this i once more come into touch

with the spot from which i once set outthe birth of tragedy was

my first transvaluation of all values with this i again take my stand

upon the soil from out of which my will and my capacity springi the

last disciple of the philosopher dionysusi the prophet of eternal

recurrence

this book belongs to the very few maybe not one of them is yet alive

unless he be of those who understand my zarathustra how can i

confound myself with those who today already find a hearingonly the

day after tomorrow belongs to me some are born posthumously
i am only too well aware of the conditions under which a man

understands me and then necessarily understands he must be

intellectually upright to the point of hardness in order even to

endure my seriousness and my passion he must be used to living on

mountaintopsand to feeling the wretched gabble of politics and

national egotism beneath him he must have become indifferent he

must never inquire whether truth is profitable or whether it may

prove fatal possessing from strength a predilection for questions

for which no one has enough courage nowadays the courage for the

forbidden his predestination must be the labyrinth the experience

of seven solitudes new ears for new music new eyes for the most

remote things a new conscience for truths which hitherto have

remained dumb and the will to economy on a large scale to husband

his strength and his enthusiasm he must honour himself he must

love himself he must be absolutely free with regardpg 126 to himself

the problem i set in this work is not what will replace mankind in the

order of living being man is an end but what type of man

must be reared must be willed as having the higher value as

being the most worthy of life and the surest guarantee of the future
pg 129
this more valuable type has appeared often enough already but as a

happy accident as an exception never as willed he has rather been

precisely the most feared hitherto he has been almost the terrible in

itselfand from out the very fear he provoked there arose the will

to rear the type which has how been reared attained the domestic

animal the gregarious animal the sick animal manthe christian

mankind does not represent a development towards a better stronger

or higher type in the sense in which this is supposed to occur today

progress is merely a modern ideathat is to say a false idea2

the modern european is still far below the european of the renaissance

in value the process of evolution does not by any means imply

elevation enhancement and increasing strength
on the other hand isolated and individual cases are continually

succeeding in different places on earth as the outcome of the most

different cultures and in these a higher type certainly manifests

itself something which by the side of mankind in general represents a

kind of superman such lucky strokes of great success have always been

possible and will perhaps always be possible and even whole races

tribes and nations may in certain circumstances represent such lucky

strokespg 130
5
we must not deck out and adorn christianity it has waged a deadly

war upon this higher type of man it has set a ban upon all the

fundamental instincts of this type and has distilled evil and the

devil himself out of these instinctsthe strong man as the typical

pariah the villain christianity has sided with everything weak low

and botched it has made an ideal out of antagonism towards all the

selfpreservative instincts of strong life it has corrupted even the

reason of the strongest intellects by teaching that the highest values

of intellectuality are sinful misleading and full of temptations

the most lamentable example of this was the corruption of pascal who

believed in the perversion of his reason through original sin whereas

it had only been perverted by his christianity
6
a painful and ghastly spectacle has just risen before my eyes i tore

down the curtain which concealed mankinds corruption this word in

my mouth is at least secure from the suspicion that it contains a moral

charge against mankind it isi would fain emphasise this againfree

from moralic acid to such an extent is this so that i am most

thoroughly conscious of the corruption in question precisely in those

quarters in which hitherto people have aspired with most determination

to virtue and to godliness as you have already surmised i

understand corruption in the sense of decadence what i maintain is

this that all the values uponpg 131 which mankind builds its highest hopes

and desires are decadent values
i call an animal a species an individual corrupt when it loses its

instincts when it selects and prefers that which is detrimental to

it a history of the higher feelings of human idealsand it is

not impossible that i shall have to write itwould almost explain why

man is so corrupt life itself to my mind is nothing more nor less

than the instinct of growth of permanence of accumulating forces

of power where the will to power is lacking degeneration sets in

my contention is that all the highest values of mankind lack this

willthat the values of decline and of nihilism are exercising the

sovereign power under the cover of the holiest names

christianity is called the religion of pitypity is opposed to

the tonic passions which enhance the energy of the feeling of life

its action is depressing a man loses power when he pities by

means of pity the drain on strength which suffering itself already

introduces into the world is multiplied a thousandfold through pity

suffering itself becomes infectious in certain circumstances it may

lead to a total loss of life and vital energy which is absurdly

put of proportion to the magnitude of the cause the case of the

death of the nazarene this is the first standpoint but there is a

still more important one supposing one measures pity according to

the value of the reactions it usually stimulates its danger to life

appears in a much more telling light on the whole pity thwarts the

lawpg 132 of development which is the law of selection it preserves that

which is ripe for death it fights in favour of the disinherited and

the condemned of life thanks to the multitude of abortions of all

kinds which it maintains in life it lends life itself a sombre and

questionable aspect people have dared to call pity a virtue in

every noble culture it is considered as a weakness people went

still further they exalted it to the virtue the root and origin

of all virtuesbut of course what must never be forgotten is the

fact that this was done from the standpoint of a philosophy which

was nihilistic and on whose shield the device the denial of life

was inscribed schopenhauer was right in this respect by means of

pity life is denied and made more worthy of denialpity is

the praxis of nihilism i repeat this depressing and infectious

instinct thwarts those instincts which aim at the preservation and

enhancement of the value life by multiplying misery quite as much

as by preserving all that is miserable it is the principal agent in

promoting decadencepity exhorts people to nothing to nonentity

but they do not say nonentity they say beyond or god or the

true life or nirvana or salvation or blessedness instead this

innocent rhetoric which belongs to the realm of the religiomoral

idiosyncrasy immediately appears to be very much less innocent if

one realises what the tendency is which here tries to drape itself in

the mantle of sublime expressionsthe tendency of hostility to life

schopenhauer was hostile to life that is why he elevated pity to a

virtue aristotle as you know recognised in pity a morbid and

dangerouspg 133 state of which it was wise to rid ones self from time to

time by a purgative he regarded tragedy as a purgative for the sake

of the instinct of life it would certainly seem necessary to find some

means of lancing any such morbid and dangerous accumulation of pity as

that which possessed schopenhauer and unfortunately the whole of our

literary and artistic decadence as well from st petersburg to paris

from tolstoi to wagner if only to make it burst nothing is

more unhealthy in the midst of our unhealthy modernity than christian

pity to be doctors here to be inexorable here to wield the knife

effectively here all this is our business all this is our

kind of love to our fellows this is what makes us philosophers us

hyperboreans
8
it is necessary to state whom we regard as our antithesisthe

theologians and all those who have the blood of theologians in their

veinsthe whole of our philosophy a man must have had his very

nose upon this fatality or better still he must have experienced it

in his own soul he must almost have perished through it in order

to be unable to treat this matter lightly the freespiritedness

of our friends the naturalists and physiologists is in my opinion

a jokewhat they lack in these questions is passion what they

lack is having suffered from these questions this poisoning

extends much further than people think i unearthed the arrogant

instinct of the theologian wherever nowadays people feel themselves

idealistspg 134wherever thanks to superior antecedents they claim the

right to rise above reality and to regard it with suspicion like

the priest the idealist has every grandiloquent concept in his hand

and not only in his hand he wields them all with kindly contempt

against the understanding the senses honours decent living

science he regards such things as beneath him as detrimental and

seductive forces upon the face of which the spirit moves in pure

absolutenessas if humility chastity poverty in a word holiness

had not done incalculably more harm to life hitherto than any sort of

horror and vice pure spirit is pure falsehood as long as the

priest the professional denier calumniator and poisoner of life is

considered as the highest kind of man there can be no answer to the

question what is truth truth has already been turned topsyturvy

when the conscious advocate of nonentity and of denial passes as the

representative of truth
9
it is upon this theological instinct that i wage war i find traces

of it everywhere whoever has the blood of theologians in his veins

stands from the start in a false and dishonest position to all things

the pathos which grows out of this state is called faith that is

to say to shut ones eyes once and for all in order not to suffer

at the sight of incurable falsity people convert this faulty view of

all things into a moral a virtue a thing of holiness they endow

their distorted vision with a good consciencethey claim that no

other point ofpg 135 view is any longer of value once theirs has been

made sacrosanct with the names god salvation eternity i

unearthed the instinct of the theologian everywhere it is the most

universal and actually the most subterranean form of falsity on earth

that which a theologian considers true must of necessity be false

this furnishes almost the criterion of truth it is his most profound

selfpreservative instinct which forbids reality ever to attain to

honour in any way or even to raise its voice whithersoever the

influence of the theologian extends valuations are topsyturvy

and the concepts true and false have necessarily changed places

that which is most deleterious to life is here called true that

which enhances it elevates it says yea to it justifies it and

renders it triumphant is called false  if it should happen that

theologians via the conscience either of princes or of the people

stretch out their hand for power let us not be in any doubt as to

what results therefrom each time namelythe will to the end the

nihilistic will to power
10
among germans i am immediately understood when i say that philosophy

is ruined by the blood of theologians the protestant minister is

the grandfather of german philosophy protestantism itself is the

latters peccatum originale definition of protestantism the

partial paralysis of christianityand of reason one needs only to

pronounce the words tbingen seminary in order to understand what

german philosophy really is at bottompg 136 theology in disguise the

swabians are the best liars in germany they lie innocently whence

came all the rejoicing with which the appearance of kant was greeted

by the scholastic world of germany threequarters of which consist of

clergymens and schoolmasters sons whence came the german conviction

which finds an echo even now that kant inaugurated a change for the

better the theologians instinct in the german scholar divined what

had once again been made possible a backstaircase leading into

the old ideal was discovered the concept true world the concept

morality as the essence of the world those two most vicious errors

that have ever existed were thanks to a subtle and wily scepticism

once again if not demonstrable at least no longer refutable

reason the prerogative of reason does not extend so far out of

reality they had made appearance and an absolutely false worldthat

of beinghad been declared to be reality kants success is merely a

theologians success like luther and like leibniz kant was one brake

the more upon the already squeaky wheel of german uprightness
11
one word more against kant as a moralist a virtue must be our

invention our most personal defence and need in every other sense it

is merely a danger that which does not constitute a condition of our

life is merely harmful to it to possess a virtue merely because one

happens to respect the concept virtue as kant would have us do is

pernicious virtue duty goodness in itselfpg 137 goodness stamped

with the character of impersonality and universal validitythese

things are mere mental hallucinations in which decline the final

devitalisation of life and knigsbergian chinadom find expression the

most fundamental laws of preservation and growth demand precisely the

reverse namelythat each should discover his own virtue his own

categorical imperative a nation goes to the dogs when it confounds

its concept of duty with the general concept of duty nothing is more

profoundly more thoroughly pernicious than every impersonal feeling

of duty than every sacrifice to the moloch of abstractionfancy no

ones having thought kants categorical imperative dangerous to life

 the instinct of the theologist alone took it under its wingan

action stimulated by the instinct of life is proved to be a proper

action by the happiness that accompanies it and that nihilist with the

bowels of a christian dogmatist regarded happiness as an objection

 what is there that destroys a man more speedily than to work

think feel as an automaton of duty without internal promptings

without a profound personal predilection without joy this is the

recipe par excellence of decadence and even of idiocy kant became

an idiotand he was the contemporary of goethe this fatal spider was

regarded as the german philosopheris still regarded as such i

refrain from saying what i think of the germans did kant not see in

the french revolution the transition of the state from the inorganic to

the organic form did he not ask himself whether there was a single

event on record which could be explainedpg 138 otherwise than as a moral

faculty of mankind so that by means of it mankinds tendency towards

good might be proved once and for all kants reply that is the

revolution instinct at fault in anything and everything hostility to

nature as an instinct german decadence made into philosophythat is

kant
12
except for a few sceptics the respectable type in the history of

philosophy the rest do not know the very first prerequisite of

intellectual uprightness they all behave like females do these great

enthusiasts and animal prodigiesthey regard beautiful feelings

themselves as arguments the heaving breast as the bellows of

divinity and conviction as the criterion of truth in the end

even kant with teutonic innocence tried to dress this lack of

intellectual conscience up in a scientific garb by means of the concept

practical reason he deliberately invented a kind of reason which

at times would allow one to dispense with reason that is to say when

morality when the sublime command thou shalt makes itself heard

when one remembers that in almost all nations the philosopher is only a

further development of the priestly type this heirloom of priesthood

this fraud towards ones self no longer surprises one when a man

has a holy lifetask as for instance to improve save or deliver

mankind when a man bears god in his breast and is the mouthpiece of

imperatives from another worldwith such a mission he stands beyond

the pale of all merely reasonable valuations he is even sanctified by

such a tastepg 139 and is already the type of a higher order what does a

priest care about science he stands too high for thatand until now

the priest has ruledhe it was who determined the concept true

and false
13
do not let us undervalue the fact that we ourselves we free spirits

are already a transvaluation of all values an incarnate declaration

of war against all the old concepts true and untrue and of a

triumph over them the most valuable standpoints are always the last

to be found but the most valuable standpoints are the methods ah the

methods and the first principles of our modern scientific procedure

had for years to encounter the profoundest contempt association

with them meant exclusion from the society of decent peopleone was

regarded as an enemy of god as a scoffer at truth and as one

possessed with ones scientific nature one belonged to the chandala

we have had the whole feeling of mankind against us hitherto their

notion of that which ought to be truth of that which ought to serve

the purpose of truth every thou shalt has been directed against

us our objects our practices our calm cautious distrustful

mannereverything about us seemed to them absolutely despicable and

beneath contempt after all it might be asked with some justice

whether the thing which kept mankind blindfold so long were not an

sthetic taste what they demanded of truth was a picturesque effect

and from the man of science what they expected was that he should make

a forcible appeal to theirpg 140 senses it was our modesty which ran

counter to their taste so long  and oh how well they guessed this

did these divine turkeycocks
14
we have altered our standpoint in every respect we have become

more modest we no longer derive man from the spirit and from the

godhead we have thrust him back among the beasts we regard him as

the strongest animal because he is the craftiest one of the results

thereof is his intellectuality on the other hand we guard against the

vain pretension which even here would fain assert itself that man is

the great arrire pense of organic evolution he is by no means the

crown of creation beside him every other creature stands at the same

stage of perfection and even in asserting this we go a little too

far for relatively speaking man is the most botched and diseased

of animals and he has wandered furthest from his instincts be all

this as it may he is certainly the most interesting as regards

animals descartes was the first with really admirable daring to

venture the thought that the beast was machina and the whole of

our physiology is endeavouring to prove this proposition moreover

logically we do not set man apart as descartes did the extent

to which man is understood today goes only so far as he has been

understood mechanistically formerly man was given free will as his

dowry from a higher sphere nowadays we have robbed him even of will

in view of the fact that no such faculty is any longer known the only

purpose served by the old wordpg 141 will is to designate a result a

sort of individual reaction which necessarily follows upon a host of

partly discordant and partly harmonious stimulithe will no longer

effects or moves anything formerly people thought that mans

consciousness his spirit was a proof of his lofty origin of his

divinity with the idea of perfecting man he was conjured to draw his

senses inside himself after the manner of the tortoise to cut off all

relations with terrestrial things and to divest himself of his mortal

shell then the most important thing about him the pure spirit

would remain over even concerning these things we have improved our

standpoint consciousness spirit now seems to us rather a symptom of

relative imperfection in the organism as an experiment a groping a

misapprehension an affliction which absorbs an unnecessary quantity of

nervous energy we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as

it is done consciously pure spirit is a piece of pure stupidity

if we discount the nervous system the senses and the mortal shell

we have miscalculatedthat it is all
15
in christianity neither morality nor religion comes in touch at all

with reality nothing but imaginary causes god the soul the ego

spirit free willor even nonfree will nothing but imaginary

effects sin salvation grace punishment forgiveness of sins

imaginary beings are supposed to have intercourse god spirits

souls imaginary natural history anthropocentric total lack of

the notion natural causes an imaginary psychology nothingpg 142

but misunderstandings of self interpretations of pleasant or

unpleasant general feelings for instance of the states of the nervus

sympathicus with the help of the sign language of a religiomoral

idiosyncrasyrepentance pangs of conscience the temptation of

the devil the presence of god an imaginary teleology the kingdom

of god the last judgment everlasting lifethis purely fictitious

world distinguishes itself very unfavourably from the world of

dreams the latter reflects reality whereas the former falsifies

depreciates and denies it once the concept nature was taken to mean

the opposite of the concept god the word natural had to acquire the

meaning of abominablethe whole of that fictitious world takes its

root in the hatred of nature reality it is the expression of

profound discomfiture in the presence of reality but this explains

everything what is the only kind of man who has reasons for wriggling

out of reality by lies the man who suffers from reality but in

order to suffer from reality one must be a bungled portion of it the

preponderance of pain over pleasure is the cause of that fictitious

morality and religion but any such preponderance furnishes the formula

for decadence
16
a criticism of the christian concept of god inevitably leads to the

same conclusiona nation that still believes in itself also has

its own god in him it honours the conditions which enable it to

remain uppermostthat is to say its virtues it projects its joy

over itself its feeling of power into a being topg 143 whom it can be

thankful for such things he who is rich will give of his riches a

proud people requires a god unto whom it can sacrifice things

religion when restricted to these principles is a form of gratitude

a man is grateful for his own existence for this he must have a

godsuch a god must be able to benefit and to injure him he must be

able to act the friend and the foe he must be esteemed for his good

as well as for his evil qualities the monstrous castration of a god

by making him a god only of goodness would lie beyond the pale of the

desires of such a community the evil god is just as urgently needed

as the good god for a people in such a form of society certainly does

not owe its existence to toleration and humaneness what would be

the good of a god who knew nothing of anger revenge envy scorn

craft and violencewho had perhaps never experienced the rapturous

ardeurs of victory and of annihilation no one would understand such

a god why should one possess himof course when a people is on

the road to ruin when it feels its belief in a future its hope of

freedom vanishing for ever when it becomes conscious of submission

as the most useful quality and of the virtues of the submissive as

selfpreservative measures then its god must also modify himself

he then becomes a tremulous and unassuming sneak he counsels peace

of the soul the cessation of all hatred leniency and love even

towards friend and foe he is for ever moralising he crawls into

the heart of every private virtue becomes a god for everybody he

retires from active service and becomes a cosmopolitan formerly

hepg 144 represented a people the strength of a people everything

aggressive and desirous of power lying concealed in the heart of a

nation now he is merely the good god in very truth gods have no

other alternative they are either the will to powerin which case

they are always the gods of whole nationsor on the other hand the

incapacity for powerin which case they necessarily become good
17
wherever the will to power no matter in what form begins to decline

a physiological retrogression decadence always supervenes the

godhead of decadence shorn of its masculine virtues and passions

is perforce converted into the god of the physiologically degraded

of the weak of course they do not call themselves the weak they

call themselves the good  no hint will be necessary to help you

to understand at what moment in history the dualistic fiction of a

good and an evil god first became possible with the same instinct by

which the subjugated reduce their god to goodness in itself they

also cancel the good qualities from their conquerors god they avenge

themselves on their masters by diabolising the latters godthe good

god and the devil as wellboth the abortions of decadencehow

is it possible that we are still so indulgent towards the simplicity

of christian theologians today as to declare with them that the

evolution of the concept god from the god of israel the god of

a people to the christian god the quintessence of all goodness

marks a step forwardbut even renan does this as if renanpg 145 had

a right to simplicity why the very contrary stares one in the face

when the prerequisites of ascending life when everything strong

plucky masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept

of god and step by step he has sunk down to the symbol of a staff

for the weary of a last straw for all those who are drowning when

he becomes the paupers god the sinners god the sick mans god

par excellence and the attribute saviour redeemer remains

over as the one essential attribute of divinity what does such a

metamorphosis such an abasement of the godhead implyundoubtedly

the kingdom of god has thus become larger formerly all he had was

his people his chosen people since then he has gone travelling

over foreign lands just as his people have done since then he has

never rested anywhere until one day he felt at home everywhere the

great cosmopolitanuntil he got the greatest number and half the

world on his side but the god of the greatest number the democrat

among gods did not become a proud heathen god notwithstanding he

remained a jew he remained the god of the back streets the god of

all dark corners and hovels of all the unwholesome quarters of the

world his universal empire is now as ever a netherworld empire

an infirmary a subterranean empire a ghettoempire and he

himself is so pale so weak so decadent  even the palest of the

pale were able to master himour friends the metaphysicians those

albinos of thought they spun their webs around him so long that

ultimately he was hypnotised by their movements and himselfpg 146 became a

spider a metaphysician thenceforward he once more began spinning the

world out of his inner beingsub specie spinozthenceforward

he transfigured himself into something ever thinner and ever more

anmic became ideal became pure spirit became absotutum and

thinginitself  the decline and fall of a god god became the

thinginitself
18
the christian concept of godgod as the deity of the sick god as a

spider god as spiritis one of the most corrupt concepts of god that

has ever been attained on earth maybe it represents the lowwater

mark in the evolutionary ebb of the godlike type god degenerated into

the contradiction of life instead of being its transfiguration and

eternal yea with god war is declared on life nature and the will to

life god is the formula for every calumny of this world and for every

lie concerning a beyond in god nonentity is deified and the will to

nonentity is declared holy
19
the fact that the strong races of northern europe did not repudiate

the christian god certainly does not do any credit to their religious

power not to speak of their taste they ought to have been able

successfully to cope with such a morbid and decrepit offshoot of

decadence and a curse lies on their heads because they were unable to

cope with him they made illness decrepitude and contradiction a part

of all their instinctssince then they have notpg 147 created any other

god two thousand years have passed and not a single new god but still

there exists and as if by rightlike an ultimum and maximum of

godcreating powerthe creator spiritus in man this miserable god

of christian monotonotheism this hybrid creature of decay nonentity

concept and contradiction in which all the instincts of decadence all

the cowardices and languors of the soul find their sanction
20
with my condemnation of christianity i should not like to have done

an injustice to a religion which is related to it and the number of

whose followers is even greater i refer to buddhism as nihilistic

religions they are akinthey are religions of decadencewhile

each is separated from the other in the most extraordinary fashion

for being able to compare them at all the critic of christianity is

profoundly grateful to indian scholarsbuddhism is a hundred times

more realistic than christianityit is part of its constitutional

heritage to be able to face problems objectively and coolly it is

the outcome of centuries of lasting philosophical activity the

concept god was already exploded when it appeared buddhism is

the only really positive religion to be found in history even

in its epistemology which is strict phenomenalismit no longer

speaks of the struggle with sin but fully recognising the true

nature of reality it speaks of the struggle with pain it already

hasand this distinguishes it fundamentally from christianitythe

selfdeception of moral concepts beneath ittopg 148 use my own

phraseology it stands beyond good and evil the two physiological

facts upon which it rests and upon which it bestows its attention

are in the first place excessive irritability of feeling which

manifests itself as a refined susceptibility to pain and also as

superspiritualisation an alltoolengthy sojourn amid concepts and

logical procedures under the influence of which the personal instinct

has suffered in favour of the impersonal both of these states

will be known to a few of my readers the objective ones who like

myself will know them from experience thanks to these physiological

conditions a state of depression set in which buddha sought to combat

by means of hygiene against it he prescribes life in the open a life

of travel moderation and careful choice in food caution in regard to

all intoxicating liquor as also in regard to all the passions which

tend to create bile and to heat the blood and he deprecates care

either on ones own or on other peoples account he recommends ideas

that bring one either peace or good cheerhe invents means whereby

the habit of contrary ideas may be lost he understands goodnessbeing

goodas promoting health prayer is out of the question as is

also asceticism there is neither a categorical imperative nor any

discipline whatsoever even within the walls of a monastery it is

always possible to leave it if one wants to all these things would

have been only a means of accentuating the excessive irritability

already referred to precisely on this account he does not exhort his

followers to wage war upon those who do not share their views nothing

is more abhorredpg 149 in his doctrine than the feeling of revenge of

aversion and of resentment not through hostility doth hostility

end the touching refrain of the whole of buddhism and in this

he was right for it is precisely these passions which are thoroughly

unhealthy in view of the principal dietetic object the mental fatigue

which he finds already existent and which expresses itself in

excessive objectivity ie the enfeeblement of the individuals

interestloss of ballast and of egoism he combats by leading

the spiritual interests as well imperatively back to the individual

in buddhas doctrine egoism is a duty the thing which is above all

necessary ie how canst thou be rid of suffering regulates

and defines the whole of the spiritual diet let anyone but think

of that athenian who also declared war upon pure scientificality

socrates who made a morality out of personal egoism even in the realm

of problems
21
the prerequisites for buddhism are a very mild climate great

gentleness and liberality in the customs of a people and no

militarism the movement must also originate among the higher and

even learned classes cheerfulness peace and absence of desire are

the highest of inspirations and they are realised buddhism is not

a religion in which perfection is merely aspired to perfection is

the normal case in christianity all the instincts of the subjugated

and oppressed come to the fore it is the lowest classes who seek

their salvation in this religion here the pastime the manner ofpg 150

killing time is to practise the casuistry of sin selfcriticism and

conscience inquisition here the ecstasy in the presence of a powerful

being called god is constantly maintained by means of prayer

while the highest thing is regarded as unattainable as a gift as an

act of grace here plain dealing is also entirely lacking concealment

and the darkened room are christian here the body is despised hygiene

is repudiated as sensual the church repudiates even cleanliness the

first christian measure after the banishment of the moors was the

closing of the public baths of which cordova alone possessed 270

a certain spirit of cruelty towards ones self and others is also

christian hatred of all those who do not share ones views the will

to persecute sombre and exciting ideas are in the foreground the most

coveted states and those which are endowed with the finest names are

really epileptic in their nature diet is selected in such a way as

to favour morbid symptoms and to overexcite the nerves christian

too is the mortal hatred of the earths rulersthe nobleand

at the same time a sort of concealed and secret competition with them

the subjugated leave the body to their masterall they want is

the soul christian is the hatred of the intellect of pride of

courage freedom intellectual libertinage christian is the hatred

of the senses of the joys of the senses of joy in general
22
when christianity departed from its native soil which consisted of the

lowest classes the submergedpg 151 masses of the ancient world and set

forth in quest of power among barbaric nations it no longer met with

exhausted men but inwardly savage and selflacerating menthe strong

but bungled men here dissatisfaction with ones self suffering

through ones self is not as in the case of buddhism excessive

irritability and susceptibility to pain but rather conversely it

is an inordinate desire for inflicting pain for a discharge of the

inner tension in hostile deeds and ideas christianity was in need of

barbaric ideas and values in order to be able to master barbarians

such are for instance the sacrifice of the firstborn the drinking

of blood at communion the contempt of the intellect and of culture

torture in all its forms sensual and nonsensual the great pomp of

the cult buddhism is a religion for senile men for races which

have become kind gentle and overspiritual and which feel pain too

easily europe is not nearly ripe for it yet it calls them back

to peace and cheerfulness to a regimen for the intellect to a certain

hardening of the body christianity aims at mastering beasts of prey

its expedient is to make them illto render feeble is the christian

recipe for taming for civilisation buddhism is a religion for the

close and exhaustion of civilisation christianity does not even find

civilisation at hand when it appears in certain circumstances it lays

the foundation of civilisation
23
buddhism i repeat is a hundred times colder more truthful

more objective it no longer requirespg 152 to justify pain and its

susceptibility to suffering by the interpretation of sinit simply

says what it thinks i suffer to the barbarian on the other hand

suffering in itself is not a respectable thing in order to acknowledge

to himself that he suffers what he requires in the first place is

an explanation his instinct directs him more readily to deny his

suffering or to endure it in silence in his case the word devil

was a blessing man had an almighty and terrible enemyhe had no

reason to be ashamed of suffering at the hands of such an enemy
at bottom there are in christianity one or two subtleties which belong

to the orient in the first place it knows that it is a matter of

indifference whether a thing be true or not but that it is of the

highest importance that it should be believed to be true truth and

the belief that something is true two totally separate worlds of

interest almost opposite worlds the road to the one and the road to

the other lie absolutely apart to be initiated into this fact almost

constitutes one a sage in the orient the brahmins understood it thus

so did plato and so does every disciple of esoteric wisdom if for

example it give anyone pleasure to believe himself delivered from sin

it is not a necessary prerequisite thereto that he should be sinful

but only that he should feel sinful if however faith is above

all necessary then reason knowledge and scientific research must be

brought into evil repute the road to truth becomes the forbidden

roadstrong hope is a much greater stimulant of life than any

single realised joy could be sufferers must be sustainedpg 153 by a hope

which no actuality can contradictand which cannot ever be realised

the hope of another world precisely on account of this power that

hope has of making the unhappy linger on the greeks regarded it as

the evil of evils as the most mischievous evil it remained behind

in pandoras box in order that love may be possible god must be a

person in order that the lowest instincts may also make their voices

heard god must be young for the ardour of the women a beautiful saint

and for the ardour of the men a virgin mary has to be pressed into the

foreground all this on condition that christianity wishes to rule

over a certain soil on which aphrodisiac or adonis cults had already

determined the notion of a cult to insist upon chastity only

intensifies the vehemence and profundity of the religious instinctit

makes the cult warmer more enthusiastic more soulfullove is the

state in which man sees things most widely different from what they

are the force of illusion reaches its zenith here as likewise the

sweetening and transfiguring power when a man is in love he endures

more than at other times he submits to everything the thing was to

discover a religion in which it was possible to love by this means

the worst in life is overcomeit is no longer even seenso much

for three christian virtues faith hope and charity i call them the

three christian precautionary measuresbuddhism is too full of aged

wisdom too positivistic to be shrewd in this way
24
here i only touch upon the problem of the originpg 154 of christianity

the first principle of its solution reads christianity can be

understood only in relation to the soil out of which it grewit is

not a countermovement against the jewish instinct it is the rational

outcome of the latter one step further in its appalling logic in

the formula of the saviour for salvation is of the jewsthe

second principle is the psychological type of the galilean is still

recognisable but it was only in a state of utter degeneration which

is at once a distortion and an overloading with foreign features that

he was able to serve the purpose for which he has been usednamely

as the type of a redeemer of mankind
the jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world

because when they were confronted with the question of being or

nonbeing with simply uncanny deliberateness they preferred being

at any price this price was the fundamental falsification of all

nature all the naturalness and all the reality of the inner quite

as much as of the outer world they hedged themselves in behind all

those conditions under which hitherto a people has been able to live

has been allowed to live of themselves they created an idea which was

the reverse of natural conditionseach in turn they twisted first

religion then the cult then morality history and psychology about

in a manner so perfectly hopeless that they were made to contradict

their natural value we meet with the same phenomena again and

exaggerated to an incalculable degree although only as a copythe

christian church as compared with the chosen people lacks all

claim to originality precisely on this account the jews are the most

fatalpg 155 people in the history of the world their ultimate influence

has falsified mankind to such an extent that even to this day the

christian can be antisemitic in spirit without comprehending that he

himself is the final consequence of judaism
it was in my genealogy of morals that i first gave a

psychological exposition of the idea of the antithesis noble and

resentmentmorality the latter having arisen out of an attitude

of negation to the former but this is judochristian morality

heart and soul in order to be able to say nay to everything that

represents the ascending movement of life prosperity power

beauty and selfaffirmation on earth the instinct of resentment

become genius bad to invent another world from the standpoint

of which that yeasaying to life appeared as the most evil and

most abominable thing from the psychological standpoint the jewish

people are possessed of the toughest vitality transplanted amid

impossible conditions with profound selfpreservative intelligence

it voluntarily took the side of all the instincts of decadencenot

as though dominated by them but because it detected a power in them

by means of which it could assert itself against the world the

jews are the opposite of all decadents they have been forced to

represent them to the point of illusion and with a non plus ultra of

histrionic genius they have known how to set themselves at the head

of all decadent movements st paul and christianity for instance in

order to create something from them which is stronger than every party

saying yea to life for the category of men which aspires to power in

judaism and christianitypg 156that is to say for the sacerdotal class

decadence is but a means this category of men has a vital interest

in making men sick and in turning the notions good and bad true

and false upside down in a manner which is not only dangerous to

life but also slanders it
25
the history of israel is invaluable as the typical history of every

denaturalization of natural values let me point to five facts

which relate thereto originally and above all in the period of

the kings even israels attitude to all things was the right one

that is to say the natural one its jehovah was the expression of

its consciousness of power of its joy over itself of its hope for

itself victory and salvation were expected from him through him it

was confident that nature would give what a people requiresabove

all rain jehovah is the god of israel and consequently the god

of justice this is the reasoning of every people which is in the

position of power and which has a good conscience in that position in

the solemn cult both sides of this selfaffirmation of a people find

expression it is grateful for the great strokes of fate by means of

which it became uppermost it is grateful for the regularity in the

succession of the seasons and for all good fortune in the rearing of

cattle and in the tilling of the soilthis state of affairs remained

the ideal for some considerable time even after it had been swept away

in a deplorable manner by anarchy from within and the assyrians from

without but the people still retained as their highest desideratum

that visionpg 157 of a king who was a good soldier and a severe judge

and he who retained it most of all was that typical prophet that

is to say critic and satirist of the age isaiahbut all hopes

remained unrealised the old god was no longer able to do what he had

done formerly he ought to have been dropped what happened the idea

of him was changedthe idea of him was denaturalised this was the

price they paid for retaining himjehovah the god of justiceis

no longer one with israel no longer the expression of a peoples

sense of dignity he is only a god on certain conditions the

idea of him becomes a weapon in the hands of priestly agitators who

henceforth interpret all happiness as a reward all unhappiness as a

punishment for disobedience to god for sin that most fraudulent

method of interpretation which arrives at a socalled moral order

of the universe by means of which the concept cause and effect

is turned upside down once natural causation has been swept out of

the world by reward and punishment a causation hostile to nature

becomes necessary whereupon all the forms of unnaturalness follow

a god who demandsin the place of a god who helps who advises

who is at bottom only a name for every happy inspiration of courage

and of selfreliance morality is no longer the expression of the

conditions of life and growth no longer the most fundamental instinct

of life but it has become abstract it has become the opposite of

lifemorality as the fundamental perversion of the imagination

as the evil eye for all things what is jewish morality what is

christian morality chance robbed of its innocence unhappinesspg 158

polluted with the idea of sin wellbeing interpreted as a danger as

a temptation physiological indisposition poisoned by means of the

cankerworm of conscience
26
the concept of god falsified the concept of morality falsified but

the jewish priesthood did not stop at this no use could be made of

the whole history of israel therefore it must go these priests

accomplished that miracle of falsification of which the greater part

of the bible is the document with unparalleled contempt and in the

teeth of all tradition and historical facts they interpreted their own

peoples past in a religious mannerthat is to say they converted

it into a ridiculous mechanical process of salvation on the principle

that all sin against jehovah led to punishment and that all pious

worship of jehovah led to reward we would feel this shameful act of

historical falsification far more poignantly if the ecclesiastical

interpretation of history through millenniums had not blunted almost

all our sense for the demands of uprightness in historicis and

the church is seconded by the philosophers the of a moral order

of the universe permeates the whole development even of more modern

philosophy what does a moral order of the universe mean that once

and for all there is such a thing as a will of god which determines

what man has to do and what he has to leave undone that the value

of a people or of an individual is measured according to how much or

how little the one or the other obeys the will of god that in the

destiniespg 159 of a people or of an individual the will of god shows

itself dominant that is to say it punishes or rewards according to

the degree of obedience in the place of this miserable falsehood

reality says a parasitical type of man who can flourish only at the

cost of all the healthy elements of life the priest abuses the name

of god he calls that state of affairs in which the priest determines

the value of things the kingdom of god he calls the means whereby

such a state of affairs is attained or maintained the will of god

with coldblooded cynicism he measures peoples ages and individuals

according to whether they favour or oppose the ascendancy of the

priesthood watch him at work in the hands of the jewish priesthood

the augustan age in the history of israel became an age of decline

the exile the protracted misfortune transformed itself into eternal

punishment for the augustan agethat age in which the priest did not

yet exist out of the mighty and thoroughly freeborn figures of the

history of israel they made according to their requirements either

wretched bigots and hypocrites or godless ones they simplified

the psychology of every great event to the idiotic formula obedient

or disobedient to goda step further the will of god that is

to say the selfpreservative measures of the priesthood must be

knownto this end a revelation is necessary in plain english a

stupendous literary fraud becomes necessary holy scriptures are

discoveredand they are published abroad with all hieratic pomp

with days of penance and lamentations over the long state of sin

the will ofpg 160 god has long stood firm the whole of the trouble

lies in the fact that the holy scriptures have been discarded

moses was already the will of god revealed what had happened

with severity and pedantry the priest had formulated once and for

alleven to the largest and smallest contributions that were to be

paid to him not forgetting the daintiest portions of meat for the

priest is a consumer of beefsteakswhat he wanted what the will

of god was  henceforward everything became so arranged that the

priests were indispensable everywhere at all the natural events of

life at birth at marriage at the sickbed at deathnot to speak

of the sacrifice the mealthe holy parasite appears in order

to denaturalise or in his language to sanctify everything

for this should be understood every natural custom every natural

institution the state the administration of justice marriage the

care of the sick and the poor every demand inspired by the instinct

of life in short everything that has a value in itself is rendered

absolutely worthless and even dangerous through the parasitism of the

priest or of the moral order of the universe a sanction after

the fact is requireda power which imparts value is necessary

which in so doing says nay to nature and which by this means alone

creates a valuation the priest depreciates and desecrates nature

it is only at this price that he exists at alldisobedience to god

that is to say to the priest to the law now receives the name of

sin the means of reconciling ones self with god are of course

of a nature whichpg 161 render subordination to the priesthood all the

more fundamental the priest alone is able to save  from the

psychological standpoint in every society organised upon a hieratic

basis sins are indispensable they are the actual weapons of power

the priest lives upon sins it is necessary for him that people

should sin  supreme axiom god forgiveth him that repentethin

plain english him that submitteth himself to the priest
27
christianity grew out of an utterly false soil in which all nature

every natural value every reality had the deepest instincts of the

ruling class against it it was a form of deadly hostility to reality

which has never been surpassed the holy people which had retained

only priestly values and priestly names for all things and which with

a logical consistency that is terrifying had divorced itself from

everything still powerful on earth as if it were unholy worldly

sinfulthis people created a final formula for its instinct which

was consistent to the point of selfsuppression as christianity it

denied even the last form of reality the holy people the chosen

people jewish reality itself the case is of supreme interest

the small insurrectionary movement christened with the name of jesus

of nazareth is the jewish instinct over againin other words

it is the sacerdotal instinct which can no longer endure the priest

as a fact it is the discovery of a kind of life even more fantastic

than the one previously conceived a vision of life which is even

more unreal than that which the organisationpg 162 of a church stipulates

christianity denies the church3
i fail to see against whom was directed the insurrection of which

rightly or wrongly jesus is understood to have been the promoter

if it were not directed against the jewish churchthe word church

being used here in precisely the same sense in which it is used today

it was an insurrection against the good and the just against

the prophets of israel against the hierarchy of societynot

against the latters corruption but against caste privilege order

formality it was the lack of faith in higher men it was a nay

uttered against everything that was tinctured with the blood of priests

and theologians but the hierarchy which was set in question if only

temporarily by this movement formed the construction of piles upon

which alone the jewish people was able to subsist in the midst of the

waters it was that peoples last chance of survival wrested from

the world at enormous pains the residuum of its political autonomy

to attack this construction was tantamount to attacking the most

profound popular instinct the most tenacious national will to live

that has ever existed on earth this saintly anarchist who called the

lowest of the low the outcasts and sinners the chandala of judaism

to revolt against the established order of things and inpg 163 language

which if the gospels are to be trusted would get one sent to siberia

even todaythis man was a political criminal in so far as political

criminals were possible in a community so absurdly nonpolitical this

brought him to the cross the proof of this is the inscription found

thereon he died for his sinsand no matter how often the contrary

has been asserted there is absolutely nothing to show that he died for

the sins of others
28
as to whether he was conscious of this contrast or whether he was

merely regarded as such is quite another question and here alone

do i touch upon the problem of the psychology of the saviouri

confess there are few books which i have as much difficulty in reading

as the gospels these difficulties are quite different from those which

allowed the learned curiosity of the german mind to celebrate one

of its most memorable triumphs many years have now elapsed since i

like every young scholar with the sage conscientiousness of a refined

philologist relished the work of the incomparable strauss i was then

twenty years of age now i am too serious for that sort of thing what

do i care about the contradictions of tradition how can saintly

legends be called tradition at all the stories of saints constitute

the most ambiguous literature on earth to apply the scientific method

to them when there are no other documents to hand seems to me to be

a fatal procedure from the startsimply learned fooling
pg 164
29
the point that concerns me is the psychological type of the saviour

this type might be contained in the gospels in spite of the gospels

and however much it may have been mutilated or overladen with

foreign features just as that of francis of assisi is contained

in his legends in spite of his legends it is not a question of

the truth concerning what he has done what he has said and how he

actually died but whether his type may still be conceived in any way

whether it has been handed down to us at allthe attempts which

to my knowledge have been made to read the history of a soul out

of the gospels seem to me to point only to disreputable levity in

psychological matters m renan that buffoon in psychologies has

contributed the two most monstrous ideas imaginable to the explanation

of the type of jesus the idea of the genius and the idea of the

hero hros but if there is anything thoroughly unevangelical

surely it is the idea of the hero it is precisely the reverse of all

struggle of all consciousness of taking part in the fight that has

become instinctive here the inability to resist is here converted into

a morality resist not evil the profoundest sentence in the whole of

the gospels their key in a certain sense the blessedness of peace

of gentleness of not being able to be an enemy what is the meaning

of glad tidingstrue life eternal life has been foundit is not

promised it is actually here it is in you it is life in love in

love free from all selection or exclusion free from all distance

everybody is the child of godjesus does not bypg 165 any means claim

anything for himself aloneas the child of god everybody is equal to

everybody else fancy making jesus a heroand what a tremendous

misunderstanding the word genius is our whole idea of spirit

which is a civilised idea could have had no meaning whatever in the

world in which jesus lived in the strict terms of the physiologist a

very different word ought to be used here we know of a condition of

morbid irritability of the sense of touch which recoils shuddering

from every kind of contact and from every attempt at grasping a solid

object any such physiological habitus reduced to its ultimate

logical conclusion becomes an instinctive hatred of all reality a

flight into the intangible into the incomprehensible a repugnance

to all formul to every notion of time and space to everything that

is established such as customs institutions the church a feeling

at ones ease in a world in which no sign of reality is any longer

visible a merely inner world a true world an eternal world

the kingdom of god is within you
30
the instinctive hatred of reality is the outcome of an extreme

susceptibility to pain and to irritation which can no longer endure to

be touched at all because every sensation strikes too deep
the instinctive exclusion of all aversion of all hostility of all

boundaries and distances in feeling is the outcome of an extreme

susceptibility to pain and to irritation which regards all resistance

all compulsory resistance as insufferable anguishthat is topg 166 say

as harmful as deprecated by the selfpreservative instinct and

which knows blessedness happiness only when it is no longer obliged

to offer resistance to anybody either evil or detrimentallove as

the only ultimate possibility of life
these are the two physiological realities upon which and out of which

the doctrine of salvation has grown i call them a sublime further

development of hedonism upon a thoroughly morbid soil epicureanism

the pagan theory of salvation even though it possessed a large

proportion of greek vitality and nervous energy remains the most

closely related to the above epicurus was a typical decadent and i

was the first to recognise him as suchthe terror of pain even of

infinitely slight painsuch a state cannot possibly help culminating

in a religion of love
31
i have given my reply to the problem in advance the prerequisite

thereto was the admission of the fact that the type of the saviour has

reached us only in a very distorted form this distortion in itself

is extremely feasible for many reasons a type of that kind could not

be pure whole and free from additions the environment in which

this strange figure moved must have left its mark upon him and the

history the destiny of the first christian communities must have

done so to a still greater degree thanks to that destiny the type

must have been enriched retrospectively with features which can be

interpreted only as serving the purposes of war and of propaganda

that strange and morbid world into which the gospels lead usa

world which seems topg 167 have been drawn from a russian novel where

the scum and dross of society diseases of the nerves and childish

imbecility seem to have given each other rendezvousmust in any case

have coarsened the type the first disciples especially must have

translated an existence conceived entirely in symbols and abstractions

into their own crudities in order at least to be able to understand

something about itfor them the type existed only after it had

been cast in a more familiar mould the prophet the messiah the

future judge the teacher of morals the thaumaturgist john the

baptistall these were but so many opportunities of misunderstanding

the type finally let us not underrate the proprium of all great

and especially sectarian veneration very often it effaces from the

venerated object all the original and frequently painfully unfamiliar

traits and idiosyncrasiesit does not even see them it is greatly

to be deplored that no dostoiewsky lived in the neighbourhood of this

most interesting decadenti mean someone who would have known how to

feel the poignant charm of such a mixture of the sublime the morbid

and the childlike finally the type as an example of decadence may

actually have been extraordinarily multifarious and contradictory

this as a possible alternative is not to be altogether ignored

albeit everything seems to point away from it for precisely in this

case tradition would necessarily have been particularly true and

objective whereas we have reasons for assuming the reverse meanwhile

a yawning chasm of contradiction separates the mountain lake and

pastoral preacher who strikes us as a buddhapg 168 on a soil only very

slightly hindu from that combative fanatic the mortal enemy of

theologians and priests whom renans malice has glorified as le

grand matre en ironie for my part i do not doubt but what the

greater part of this venom and even of esprit was inoculated into

the type of the master only as the outcome of the agitated condition

of christian propaganda for we have ample reasons for knowing the

unscrupulousness of all sectarians when they wish to contrive their own

apology out of the person of their master when the first christian

community required a discerning wrangling quarrelsome malicious and

hairsplitting theologian to oppose other theologians it created its

god according to its needs just as it did not hesitate to put upon

his lips those utterly unevangelical ideas of his second coming the

last judgmentideas with which it could not then dispenseand

every kind of expectation and promise which happened to be current
32
i can only repeat that i am opposed to the importation of the fanatic

into the type of the saviour the word imprieux which renan

uses in itself annuls the type the glad tidings are simply that

there are no longer any contradictions that the kingdom of heaven is

for the children the faith which raises its voice here is not a

faith that has been won by a struggleit is to hand it was there

from the beginning it is a sort of spiritual return to childishness

the case of delayed and undeveloped puberty in the organism as the

resultpg 169 of degeneration is at least familiar to physiologists a faith

of this sort does not show anger it does not blame neither does it

defend itself it does not bring the swordit has no inkling of

how it will one day establish feuds between man and man it does not

demonstrate itself either by miracles or by reward and promises or

yet through the scriptures it is in itself at every moment its own

miracle its own reward its own proof its own kingdom of god this

faith cannot be formulatedit lives it guards against formulas the

accident of environment of speech of preparatory culture certainly

determines a particular series of conceptions early christianity deals

only in judosemitic conceptions the eating and drinking at the

last supper form part of thesethis idea which like everything jewish

has been abused so maliciously by the church but one should guard

against seeing anything more than a language of signs semiotics an

opportunity for parables in all this the very fact that no word is to

be taken literally is the only condition on which this antirealist

is able to speak at all among indians he would have made use of the

ideas of sankhyara among chinese those of laotzeand would not

have been aware of any difference with a little terminological laxity

jesus might be called a free spirithe cares not a jot for anything

that is established the word killeth everything fixed killtth

the idea experience life as he alone knows it is according to

him opposed to every kind of word formula law faith and dogma he

speaks only of the innermost things life orpg 170 truth or light is

his expression for the innermost thingeverything else the whole of

reality the whole of nature language even has only the value of a

sign of a simile for himit is of paramount importance not to make

any mistake at this point however great may be the temptation thereto

that lies in christiani mean to say ecclesiastical prejudice any

such essential symbolism stands beyond the pale of all religion all

notions of cult all history all natural science all experience of

the world all knowledge all politics all psychology all books and

all artfor his wisdom is precisely the complete ignorance4 of the

existence of such things he has not even heard speak of culture he

does not require to oppose ithe does not deny it the same holds

good of the state of the whole of civil and social order of work

and of warhe never had any reason to deny the world he had not the

vaguest notion of the ecclesiastical concept the world  denying

is precisely what was quite impossible to himdialectic is also

quite absent as likewise the idea that any faith any truth can be

proved by argument his proofs are inner lights inward feelings of

happiness and selfaffirmation a host of proofs of power neither

can such a doctrine contradict it does not even realise the fact that

there are or can be other doctrines it is absolutely incapable of

imagining a contrary judgment wherever it encounters such things

from a feeling of profound sympathy itpg 171 bemoans such blindnessfor

it sees the lightbut it raises no objections
33
the whole psychology of the gospels lacks the concept of guilt and

punishment as also that of reward sin any sort of aloofness

between god and man is done away withthis is precisely what

constitutes the glad tidings eternal bliss is not promised it is

not bound up with certain conditions it is the only realitythe rest

consists only of signs wherewith to speak about it
the results of such a state project themselves into a new practice

of life the actual evangelical practice it is not a faith which

distinguishes the christians the christian acts he distinguishes

himself by means of a different mode of action he does not resist

his enemy either by words or in his heart he draws no distinction

between foreigners and natives between jews and gentiles the

neighbour really means the coreligionist the jew he is angry with

no one he despises no one he neither shows himself at the tribunals

nor does he acknowledge any of their claims swear not at all

he never under any circumstances divorces his wife even when her

infidelity has been provedall this is at bottom one principle it is

all the outcome of one instinct
the life of the saviour was naught else than this practiceneither

was his death he no longer required any formul any rites for his

relations with godnot even prayer he has done with allpg 172 the jewish

teaching of repentance and of atonement he alone knows the mode

of life which makes one feel divine saved evangelical and

at all times a child of god not repentance not prayer and

forgiveness are the roads to god the evangelical mode of life

alone leads to god it is godthat which the gospels abolished

was the judaism of the concepts sin forgiveness of sin faith

salvation through faiththe whole doctrine of the jewish church was

denied by the glad tidings
the profound instinct of how one must live in order to feel in

heaven in order to feel eternal while in every other respect

one feels by no means in heaven this alone is the psychological

reality of salvationa new life and not a new faith
34
if i understand anything at all about this great symbolist it is

this that he regarded only inner facts as facts as truthsthat

he understood the rest everything natural temporal material

and historical only as signs as opportunities for parables the

concept the son of man is not a concrete personality belonging to

history anything individual and isolated but an eternal fact

a psychological symbol divorced from the concept of time the same

is true and in the highest degree of the god of this typical

symbolist of the kingdom of god of the kingdom of heaven and

of the sonship of god nothing is more unchristlike than the

ecclesiastical crudity of a personal god of a kingdompg 173 of god that

is coming of a kingdom of heaven beyond of a son of god as the

second person of the trinity all this if i may be forgiven the

expression is as fitting as a square peg in a round holeand oh

what a holethe gospels a worldhistoric cynicism in the scorn

of symbols but what is meant by the signs father and son is

of course obviousnot to everybody i admit with the word son

entrance into the feeling of the general transfiguration of all

things beatitude is expressed with the word father this feeling

itself the feeling of eternity and of perfectioni blush to have to

remind you of what the church has done with this symbolism has it not

set an amphitryon story at the threshold of the christian faith and

a dogma of immaculate conception into the bargain but by so doing

it defiled conception
the kingdom of heaven is a state of the heartnot something

which exists beyond this earth or comes to you after death the

whole idea of natural death is lacking in the gospels death is not

a bridge not a means of access it is absent because it belongs to

quite a different and merely apparent world the only use of which is

to furnish signs similes the hour of death is not a christian

ideathe hour time in general physical life and its crises do not

exist for the messenger of glad tidings  the kingdom of god is

not some thing that is expected it has no yesterday nor any day after

tomorrow it is not going to come in a thousand yearsit is an

experience of a human heart it is everywhere it is nowhere
pg 174
35
this messenger of glad tidings died as he lived and as he

taughtnot in order to save mankind but in order to show how one

ought to live it was a mode of life that he bequeathed to mankind his

behaviour before his judges his attitude towards his executioners

his accusers and all kinds of calumny and scornhis demeanour on

the cross he offers no resistance he does not defend his rights

he takes no step to ward off the most extreme consequences he does

morehe provokes them and he prays suffers and loves with those in

those who treat him ill not to defend ones self not to show

anger not to hold anyone responsible but to refrain from resisting

even the evil oneto love him
36
only we spirits that have become free possess the necessary

condition for understanding something which nineteen centuries have

misunderstoodthat honesty which has become an instinct and a passion

in us and which wages war upon the holy lie with even more vigour

than upon every other lie mankind was unspeakably far from our

beneficent and cautious neutrality from that discipline of the mind

which alone renders the solution of such strange and subtle things

possible at all times with shameless egoism all that people sought

was their own advantage in these matters the church was built up out

of contradiction to the gospel
whoever might seek for signs pointing to the guiding fingers of an

ironical deity behind the greatpg 175 comedy of existence would find no

small argument in the huge note of interrogation that is called

christianity the fact that mankind is on its knees before the reverse

of that which formed the origin the meaning and the rights of

the gospel the fact that in the idea church precisely that is

pronounced holy which the messenger of glad tidings regarded as

beneath him as behind himone might seek in vain for a more

egregious example of worldhistoric irony
37
our age is proud of its historical sense how could it allow

itself to be convinced of the nonsensical idea that at the beginning

christianity consisted only of the clumsy fable of the thaumaturgist

and of the saviour and that all its spiritual and symbolic

side was only developed later on the contrary the history of

christianityfrom the death on the cross onwardsis the history of

a gradual and ever coarser misunderstanding of an original symbolism

with every extension of christianity over ever larger and ruder

masses who were ever less able to grasp its first principles the

need of vulgarising and barbarising it increased proportionatelyit

absorbed the teachings and rites of all the subterranean cults of the

imperium romanum as well as the nonsense of every kind of morbid

reasoning the fatal feature of christianity lies in the necessary

fact that its faith had to become as morbid base and vulgar as the

needs to which it had to minister were morbid base and vulgar morbid

barbarism at last braces itself together for power in the form of the

churchpg 176the church this deadly hostility to all honesty to all

loftiness of the soul to all discipline of the mind to all frank and

kindly humanitychristian and noble values only we spirits who

have become free have reestablished this contrast in values which is

the greatest that has ever existed on earth
38
i cannot at this point stifle a sigh there are days when i

am visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholythe

contempt of man and in order that i may leave you in no doubt as

to what i despise whom i despise i declare that it is the man of

today the man with whom i am fatally contemporaneous the man of

today i am asphyxiated by his foul breath towards the past like

all knights of knowledge i am profoundly tolerantthat is to say

i exercise a sort of generous selfcontrol with gloomy caution i

pass through whole millennia of this madhouse world and whether it

be called christianity christian faith or christian church i

take care not to hold mankind responsible for its mental disorders

but my feeling suddenly changes and vents itself the moment i enter

the modern age our age our age knows that which formerly

was merely morbid is now positively indecent it is indecent nowadays

to be a christian and it is here that my loathing begins i look

about me not a word of what was formerly known as truth has remained

standing we can no longer endure to hear a priest even pronounce the

word truth even he whopg 177 makes but the most modest claims upon truth

must know at present that a theologian a priest or a pope not

only errs but actually ties with every word that he uttersand

that he is no longer able to lie from innocence from ignorance

even the priest knows quite as well as everybody else does that there

is no longer any god any sinner or any saviour and that free

will and a moral order of the universe are lies seriousness

the profound selfconquest of the spirit no longer allows anyone to

be ignorant about this all the concepts of the church have been

revealed in their true coloursthat is to say as the most vicious

frauds on earth calculated to depreciate nature and all natural

values the priest himself has been recognised as what he isthat is

to say as the most dangerous kind of parasite as the actual venomous

spider of existence at present we know our conscience knows

the real value of the gruesome inventions which the priests and the

church have made and what end they served by means of them that

state of selfprofanation on the part of man has been attained the

sight of which makes one heave the concepts beyond last judgment

immortality of the soul the soul itself are merely so many

instruments of torture so many systems of cruelty on the strength

of which the priest became and remained master everybody knows

this and nevertheless everything remains as it was whither has

the last shred of decency of selfrespect gone if nowadays even

our statesmena body of men who are otherwise so unembarrassed and

such thorough antichristians in deedstill declare themselvespg 178

christians and still flock to communion5 fancy a prince at the

head of his legions magnificent as the expression of the egoism and

selfexaltation of his peoplebut shameless enough to acknowledge

himself a christian what then does christianity deny what does

it call world the world to christianity means that a man is a

soldier a judge a patriot that he defends himself that he values

his honour that he desires his own advantage that he is proud

 the conduct of every moment every instinct every valuation that

leads to a deed is at present antichristian what an abortion of

falsehood modern man must be in order to be able without a blush

still to call himself a christian
39
i will retrace my steps and will tell you the genuine

history of christianitythe very word christianity is a

misunderstandingtruth to tell there never was more than one

christian and he died on the cross the gospel died on the

cross that which thenceforward was called gospel was the reverse

of that gospel that christ had lived it was evil tidings a

dysangel it is false to the point of nonsense to see in faith

in the faith in salvation through christ the distinguishing trait

of the christian the only thing that is christian is the christian

mode of existence a life such as he led who died on the cross to

this day a life of this kind is still possible forpg 179 certain men it

is even necessary genuine primitive christianity will be possible

in all ages not a faith but a course of action above all a

course of inaction noninterference and a different life states

of consciousness any sort of faith a holding of certain things

for true as every psychologist knows are indeed of absolutely no

consequence and are only of fifthrate importance compared with the

value of the instincts more exactly the whole concept of intellectual

causality is false to reduce the fact of being a christian or of

christianity to a holding of something for true to a mere phenomenon

of consciousness is tantamount to denying christianity in fact

there have never been any christians the christian he who for two

thousand years has been called a christian is merely a psychological

misunderstanding of self looked at more closely there ruled in

him notwithstanding all his faith only instinctsand what

instinctsfaith in all ages as for instance in the case of

luther has always been merely a cloak a pretext a screen behind

which the instincts played their gamea prudent form of blindness

in regard to the dominion of certain instincts faith i have

already characterised as a piece of really christian cleverness for

people have always spoken of faith and acted according to their

instincts in the christians world of ideas there is nothing which

even touches reality but i have already recognised in the instinctive

hatred of reality the actual motive force the only driving power at

the root of christianity what follows therefrom that here even

in psychologicispg 180 error is fundamentalthat is to say capable

of determining the spirit of thingsthat is to say substance

take one idea away from the whole and put one realistic fact in its

steadand the whole of christianity tumbles into nonentitysurveyed

from above this strangest of all factsa religion not only dependent

upon error but inventive and showing signs of genius only in those

errors which are dangerous and which poison life and the human

heartremains a spectacle for gods for those gods who are at the

same time philosophers and whom i met for instance in those celebrated

dialogues on the island of naxos at the moment when they get rid

of their loathing and we do as well they will be thankful

for the spectacle the christians have offered the wretched little

planet called earth perhaps deserves on account of this curious

case alone a divine glance and divine interest let us not

therefore underestimate the christians the christian false to the

point of innocence in falsity is far above the apesin regard to

the christians a certain wellknown theory of descent becomes a mere

goodnatured compliment

the fate of the gospel was decided at the moment of the deathit

hung on the cross  it was only death this unexpected and

ignominious death it was only the cross which as a rule was reserved

simply for the canailleonly this appalling paradox which

confronted the disciples with the actual riddle who was that what

was thatpg 181the state produced by the excited and profoundly wounded

feelings of these men the suspicion that such a death might imply the

refutation of their cause and the terrible note of interrogation

why precisely thus will be understood only too well in this case

everything must be necessary everything must have meaning a reason

the highest reason the love of a disciple admits of no such thing as

accident only then did the chasm yawn who has killed him who was

his natural enemythis question rent the firmament like a flash of

lightning reply dominant judaism its ruling class thenceforward

the disciple felt himself in revolt against established order he

understood jesus after the fact as one in revolt against established

order heretofore this warlike this naysaying and naydoing feature

in christ had been lacking nay more he was its contradiction the

small primitive community had obviously understood nothing of the

principal factor of all which was the example of freedom and of

superiority to every form of resentment which lay in this way of

dying and this shows how little they understood him altogether at

bottom jesus could not have desired anything else by his death than to

give the strongest public example and proof of his doctrine

but his disciples were very far from forgiving this deaththough if

they had done so it would have been in the highest sense evangelical

on their partneither were they prepared with a gentle and serene

calmness of heart to offer themselves for a similar death

precisely the most unevangelical feeling revenge became once morepg 182

ascendant it was impossible for the cause to end with this death

compensation and judgment were required and forsooth what could

be more unevangelical than compensation punishment judgment

the popular expectation of a messiah once more became prominent

attention was fixed upon one historical moment the kingdom of god

descends to sit in judgment upon his enemies but this proves that

everything was misunderstood the kingdom of god regarded as the last

scene of the last act as a promise but the gospel had clearly been

the living the fulfilment the reality of this kingdom of god

it was precisely a death such as christs that was this kingdom of

god it was only now that all the contempt for the pharisees and the

theologians and all bitter feelings towards them were introduced

into the character of the masterand by this means he himself was

converted into a pharisee and a theologian on the other hand the

savage veneration of these completely unhinged souls could no longer

endure that evangelical right of every man to be the child of god

which jesus had taught their revenge consisted in elevating jesus in

a manner devoid of all reason and in separating him from themselves

just as formerly the jews with the view of revenging themselves on

their enemies separated themselves from their god and placed him high

above them the only god and the only son of godboth were products

of resentment
41
and from this time forward an absurd problempg 183 rose into prominence

how could god allow it to happen to this question the disordered

minds of the small community found a reply which in its absurdity

was literally terrifying god gave his son as a sacrifice for the

forgiveness of sins alas how prompt and sudden was the end of

the gospel expiatory sacrifice for guilt and indeed in its most

repulsive and barbaric formthe sacrifice of the innocent for

the sins of the guilty what appalling paganismfor jesus himself

had done away with the concept guilthe denied any gulf between

god and man he lived this unity between god and man it was this

that constituted his glad tidings  and he did not teach it

as a privilegethenceforward there was gradually imported into the

type of the saviour the doctrine of the last judgment and of the

second coming the doctrine of sacrificial death and the doctrine

of resurrection by means of which the whole concept blessedness

the entire and only reality of the gospel is conjured awayin favour

of a state after death st paul with that rabbinic impudence

which characterises all his doings rationalised this conception this

prostitution of a conception as follows if christ did not rise from

the dead our faith is vainand in a trice the most contemptible

of all unrealisable promises the impudent doctrine of personal

immortality was woven out of the gospel st paul even preached this

immortality as a reward
42
you now realise what it was that came to an end with the death on the

cross a new and thoroughlypg 184 original effort towards a buddhistic

movement of peace towards real and not merely promised happiness

on earth for as i have already pointed out this remains the

fundamental difference between the two religions of decadence

buddhism promises little but fulfils more christianity promises

everything but fulfils nothingthe glad tidings were followed

closely by the absolutely worst tidingsthose of st paul paul is

the incarnation of a type which is the reverse of that of the saviour

he is the genius in hatred in the standpoint of hatred and in the

relentless logic of hatred and alas what did this dysangelist not

sacrifice to his hatred above all the saviour himself he nailed him

to his cross christs life his example his doctrine and death

the sense and the right of the gospelnot a vestige of alt this

was left once this forger prompted by his hatred had understood

in it only that which could serve his purpose not reality not

historical truth  and once more the sacerdotal instinct of

the jew perpetrated the same great crime against historyhe

simply cancelled the yesterday and the day before that out of

christianity he contrived of his own accord a history of the birth

of christianity he did more he once more falsified the history of

israel so as to make it appear as a prologue to his mission all the

prophets had referred to his saviour  later on the church even

distorted the history of mankind so as to convert it into a prelude to

christianity the type of the saviour his teaching his life his

death the meaning of his death even the sequel to his deathnothing

remained untouched nothing was left which evenpg 185 remotely resembled

reality st paul simply transferred the centre of gravity of the whole

of that great life to a place behind this lifein the lie of

the resuscitated christ at bottom he had no possible use for the

life of the saviourhe needed the death on the cross and something

more to regard as honest a man like st paul a man whose home was the

very headquarters of stoical enlightenment when he devises a proof

of the continued existence of the saviour out of a hallucination or

even to believe him when he declares that he had this hallucination

would amount to foolishness on the part of a psychologist st paul

desired the end consequently he also desired the means even what

he himself did not believe was believed in by the idiots among whom

he spread his doctrinewhat he wanted was power with st paul the

priest again aspired to powerhe could make use only of concepts

doctrines symbols with which masses may be tyrannised over and

with which herds are formed what was the only part of christianity

which was subsequently borrowed by muhamed st pauls invention his

expedient for priestly tyranny and to the formation of herds the

belief in immortalitythat is to say the doctrine of the last

judgment 
43
when the centre of gravity of life is laid not in life but in a

beyondin nonentitylife is utterly robbed of its balance the

great lie of personal immortality destroys all reason all nature in

the instinctseverything in the instincts that is beneficent that

promotes life and that is a guaranteepg 186 of the future henceforward

aroused suspicion the very meaning of life is now construed as the

effort to live in such a way that life no longer has any point why

show any public spirit why be grateful for ones origin and ones

forebears why collaborate with ones fellows and be confident why

be concerned about the general weal or strive after it all these

things are merely so many temptations so many deviations from the

straight path one thing only is necessary  that everybody as

an immortal soul should have equal rank that in the totality of

beings the salvation of each individual may lay claim to eternal

importance that insignificant bigots and threequarterlunatics may

have the right to suppose that the laws of nature may be persistently

broken on their accountany such magnification of every kind

of selfishness to infinity to insolence cannot be branded with

sufficient contempt and yet it is to this miserable flattery of

personal vanity that christianity owes its triumphby this means

it lured all the bungled and the botched all revolting and revolted

people all abortions the whole of the refuse and offal of humanity

over to its side the salvation of the soulin plain english the

world revolves around me  the poison of the doctrine equal

rights for allhas been dispensed with the greatest thoroughness by

christianity christianity prompted by the most secret recesses of

bad instincts has waged a deadly war upon all feeling of reverence

and distance between man and manthat is to say the prerequisite

of all elevation of every growth in culture out ofpg 187 the resentment

of the masses it wrought its principal weapons against us against

everything noble joyful exalted on earth against our happiness on

earth to grant immortality to every st peter and st paul was

the greatest the most vicious outrage upon noble humanity that has

ever been perpetratedand do not let us underestimate the fatal

influence which springing from christianity has insinuated itself

even into politics nowadays no one has the courage of special rights

of rights of t dominion of a feeling of selfrespect and of respect

for his equalsof pathos of distance our politics are diseased

with this lack of couragethe aristocratic attitude of mind has been

most thoroughly undermined by the lie of the equality of souls and if

the belief in the privilege of the greatest number creates and will

continue to create revolutionsit is christianity let there be no

doubt about it and christian values which convert every revolution

into blood and crime christianity is the revolt of all things that

crawl on their bellies against everything that is lofty the gospel of

the lowly lowers
44
the gospels are invaluable as a testimony of the corruption which

was already persistent within the first christian communities that

which st paul with the logicians cynicism of a rabbi carried to its

logical conclusion was nevertheless merely the process of decay which

began with the death of the saviourthese gospels cannot be read

too cautiously difficulties lurk behind every word theypg 188 contain i

confess and people will not take this amiss that they are precisely

on that account a joy of the first rank for a psychologistas the

reverse of all naive perversity as refinement par excellence as

a masterpiece of art in psychological corruption the gospels stand

alone altogether the bible allows of no comparison the first thing

to be remembered if we do not wish to lose the scent here is that

we are among jews the dissembling of holiness which here literally

amounts to genius and which has never been even approximately achieved

elsewhere either by books or by men this fraud in word and pose

which in this book is elevated to an art is not the accident of

any individual gift of any exceptional nature these qualities are

a matter of race with christianity the art of telling holy lies

which constitutes the whole of judaism reaches its final mastership

thanks to many centuries of jewish and most thoroughly serious training

and practice the christian this ultima ratio of falsehood is the

jew over againhe is even three times a jew the fundamental will

only to make use of concepts symbols and poses which are demonstrated

by the practice of the priests the instinctive repudiation of every

other kind of practice every other standpoint of valuation and of

utilityall this is not only tradition it is hereditary only as

an inheritance is it able to work like nature the whole of mankind

the best brains and even the best agesone man only excepted who

is perhaps only a monsterhave allowed themselves to be deceived

the gospels were read as the book of innocence  this is no

insignificantpg 189 sign of the virtuosity with which deception has been

practised hereof course if we could only succeed in seeing all

these amazing bigots and pretended saints even for a moment all

would be at an endand it is precisely because i can read no

single word of theirs without seeing their pretentious poses that

i have made an end of them i cannot endure a certain way they

have of casting their eyes heavenwardsfortunately for christianity

books are for the greatest number merely literature we must not let

ourselves be led away judge not they say but they dispatch all

those to hell who stand in their way inasmuch as they let god do the

judging they themselves judge inasmuch as they glorify god they

glorify themselves inasmuch as they exact those virtues of which

they themselves happen to be capablenay more of which they are in

need in order to be able to remain on top at allthey assume the

grand airs of struggling for virtue of struggling for the dominion of

virtue we live we die we sacrifice ourselves for the good the

truth the light the kingdom of god as a matter of fact they

do only what they cannot help doing like sneaks they have to play a

humble part sit away in corners and remain obscurely in the shade

and they make all this appear a duty their humble life now appears as

a duty and their humility is one proof the more of their piety

oh what a humble chaste and compassionate kind of falsity virtue

itself shall bear us testimony  only read the gospels as books

calculated to seduce by means of morality morality is appropriated by

these petty peoplethey knowpg 190 what morality can do the best way of

leading mankind by the nose is with morality the fact is that the most

conscious conceit of people who believe themselves to be chosen

here simulates modesty in this way they the christian community the

good and the just place themselves once and for all on a certain

side the side of truthand the rest of mankind the world on

the other this was the most fatal kind of megalomania that had

ever yet existed on earth insignificant little abortions of bigots

and liars began to lay sole claim to the concepts god truth

light spirit love wisdom life as if these things were

so to speak synonyms of themselves in order to fence themselves off

from the world little ultrajews ripe for every kind of madhouse

twisted values round in order to suit themselves just as if the

christian alone were the meaning the salt the standard and even the

ultimate tribunal of all the rest of mankind the whole fatality

was rendered possible only because a kind of megalomania akin to this

one and allied to it in racethe jewish kindwas already to hand in

the world the very moment the gulf between jews and judochristians

was opened the latter had no alternative left but to adopt the same

selfpreservative measures as the jewish instinct suggested even

against the jews themselves whereas the jews theretofore had

employed these same measures only against the gentiles the christian

is nothing more than an anarchical jew
45
let me give you a few examples of what thesepg 191 paltry people have

stuffed into their heads what they have laid on the lips of their

master quite a host of confessions from beautiful souls
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart

thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against

them verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom

me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck

and he were cast into the sea mark ix 42how evangelical

enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be

cast into hell fire where their worm dieth not and the fire is not

quenched mark ix 47 48the eye is not precisely what is meant

judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge

ye shall be judged matthew vii i 2what a strange notion of

justice on the part of a just judge
for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even

the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye

more than others do not even the publicans so matthew v 46 47

the principle of christian love it insists upon being well paid

forgive your trespasses matthew vi 15very compromising for the

father in question
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all

these things shall be added unto you matthew vi 33all these

thingsthat is to say food clothing all the necessities of life

dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god

destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are st

paul i corinthians iii 16 17one cannot have too much contempt

for this sort of thing
pg 193
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world

shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters

st paul i corinthians vi 2unfortunately this is not merely the

speech of a lunatic this appalling impostor proceeds thus know

ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to

this life
hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in

the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by

the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe  not many

wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called

but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the

wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound

the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things

which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not

to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should glory in

his presence st paul i corinthians i 20 et seqin order to

understand this passage which is of the highest importance as an

example of the psychology of every chandala morality the reader should

refer to my genealogy of morals in this book the contrast between

a noble and a chandala morality born of resentment and impotent

revengefulness is brought to light for the first time st paul was the

greatest of all the apostles of revenge
46
what follows from this that one does well topg 194 put on ones gloves

when reading the new testament the proximity of so much pitch almost

defiles one we should feel just as little inclined to hobnob with

the first christians as with polish jews not that we need explain

our objections they simply smell badin vain have i sought for a

single sympathetic feature in the new testament there is not a trace

of freedom kindliness openheartedness and honesty to be found in

it humaneness has not even made a start in this book while cleanly

instincts are entirely absent from it only evil instincts are to be

found in the new testament it shows no sign of courage these people

lack even the courage of their evil instincts all is cowardice all is

a closing of ones eyes and selfdeception every book becomes clean

after one has just read the new testament for instance immediately

after laying down st paul i read with particular delight that most

charming and most wanton of scoffers petronius of whom someone might

say what domenico boccaccio wrote to the duke of parma about csar

borgia  tutto festoimmortally healthy immortally cheerful

and wellconstituted  these petty bigots err in their calculations

and in the most important thing of all they certainly attack but

everything they assail is by that very fact alone distinguished

he whom a primitive christian attacks is not thereby sullied

conversely it is an honour to be opposed by primitive christians

one cannot read the new testament without feeling a preference for

everything in it which is the subject of abusenot to speak of the

wisdom of this worldpg 195 which an impudent windbag tries in vain to

confound by the foolishness of preaching even the pharisees and the

scribes derive advantage from such opposition they must certainly

have been worth something in order to have been hated in such a

disreputable way hypocrisyas if this were a reproach which the

first christians were at liberty to makeafter all the scribes

and pharisees were the privileged ones this was quite enough the

hatred of the chandala requires no other reasons i very much fear

that the first christianas also the last christian whom i may

yet be able to meet is in his deepest instincts a rebel against

everything privileged he lives and struggles unremittingly for equal

rights regarded more closely he has no alternative if ones

desire be personally to represent one of the chosen of godor a

temple of god or a judge of angelsthen every other principle

of selection for instance that based upon a standard of honesty

intellect manliness and pride or upon beauty and freedom of heart

becomes the worldevil in itself moral every word on the lips

of a first christian is a lie every action he does is an instinctive

falsehoodall his values all his aims are pernicious but the man

he hates the thing he hates has value  the christian more

particularly the christian priest is a criterion of valuesdo i

require to add that in the whole of the new testament only one figure

appears which we cannot help respecting pilate the roman governor to

take a jewish quarrel seriously was a thing he could not get himself

to do one jew more or lesswhat did it matter the noblepg 196 scorn

of a roman in whose presence the word truth had been shamelessly

abused has enriched the new testament with the only saying which is

of valueand this saying is not only the criticism but actually the

shattering of that testament what is truth
47
that which separates us from other people is not the fact that

we can discover no god either in history or in nature or behind

naturebut that we regard what has been revered as god not as

divine but as wretched absurd pernicious not as an error but as

a crime against life  we deny god as god if the existence

of this christian god were proved to us we should feel even less

able to believe in himin a formula deus qualem paulus creavit

dei negatioa religion such as christianity which never once comes

in touch with reality and which collapses the very moment reality

asserts its rights even on one single point must naturally be a mortal

enemy of the wisdom of this worldthat is to say science it

will call all those means good with which mental discipline lucidity

and severity in intellectual matters nobility and freedom of the

intellect may be poisoned calumniated and decried faith as an

imperative is a veto against sciencein praxi it means lies

at any price st paul understood that falsehoodthat faith was

necessary subsequently the church understood st paulthat god

which st paul invented for himself a god who confounds the wisdom

of this world in a narrower sense thepg 197 two great opponents of all

superstition philology and medicine means in very truth simply st

pauls firm resolve to do so to call his own will god thora

that is archjewish st paul insists upon confounding the wisdom of

this world his enemies are the good old philologists and doctors of

the alexandrine schools it is on them that he wages war as a matter

of fact no one is either a philologist or a doctor who is not also an

antichrist as a philologist for instance a man sees behind the

holy books as a doctor he sees behind the physiological rottenness

of the typical christian the doctor says incurable the philologist

says forgery
48
has anybody ever really understood the celebrated story which stands

at the beginning of the bibleconcerning gods deadly panic over

science  nobody has understood it this essentially sacerdotal

book naturally begins with the great inner difficulty of the priest

he knows only one great danger consequently god has only one

great danger
the old god entirely spirit a highpriest through and through and

wholly perfect is wandering in a leisurely fashion round his garden

but he is bored against boredom even the gods themselves struggle in

vain7 what does he do he invents manman is entertaining but

beholdpg 198 even man begins to be bored gods compassion for the only

form of misery which is peculiar to all paradises exceeds all bounds

so forthwith he creates yet other animals gods first mistake man

did not think animals entertaininghe dominated them he did not even

wish to be an animal consequently god created woman and boredom did

indeed cease from that momentbut many other things ceased as well

woman was gods second mistakewoman in her innermost nature is a

serpent hevaevery priest knows this all evil came into this world

through womanevery priest knows this too consequently science

also comes from woman  only through woman did man learn to taste

of the tree of knowledgewhat had happened panic had seized the

old god man himself had been his greatest mistake he had created

a rival for himself science makes you equal to godit is all up

with priests and gods when man becomes scientificmoral science is

the most prohibited thing of allit alone is forbidden science is

the first the germ of all sins the original sin this alone is

moralitythou shalt not knowthe rest follows as a matter of

course gods panic did not deprive him of his intelligence how can

one guard against science for ages this was his principal problem

reply man must be kicked out of paradise happiness leisure leads to

thinkingall thoughts are bad thoughts man must not thinkand

the priestperse proceeds to invent distress death the vital

danger of pregnancy every kind of misery decrepitude and affliction

and above all diseaseall these are but weaponspg 199 employed in the

struggle with science trouble prevents man from thinking and

notwithstanding all these precautions oh horror the work of science

towers aloft it storms heaven itself it rings the deathknell of the

godswhats to be donethe old god invents war he separates the

nations and contrives to make men destroy each other mutually the

priests have always been in need of war war among other things

is a great disturber of scienceincredible knowledge the rejection

of the sacerdotal yoke nevertheless increasesso the old god

arrives at this final decision man has become scientificthere is

no help for it he must be drowned 
49
you have understood me the beginning of the bible contains the whole

psychology of the priestthe priest knows only one great danger and

that is sciencethe healthy concept of cause and effect but on the

whole science flourishes onlyunder happy conditionsa man must

have time he must also have superfluous mental energy in order to

pursue knowledge  consequently man must be made unhappythis

has been the argument of the priest of all agesyou have already

divined what in accordance with such a manner of arguing must

first have come into the worldsin  the notion of guilt and

punishment the whole moral order of the universe was invented

against scienceagainst the deliverance of man from the priest

man must not cast his glance upon the outer world he must turn it

inwards into himself he must not aspg 200 a learner look cleverly and

cautiously into things he must not see at all he must suffer

 and he must suffer so that he may be in need of the priest every

minuteaway with doctors what is needed is a saviourthe notion of

guilt and punishment including the doctrine of grace of salvation

and of forgivenessall lies through and through without a shred

of psychological realitywere invented in order to destroy mans

sense of causality they are an attack on the concept of cause and

effectand not an attack with the fist with the knife with

honesty in hate and love but one actuated by the most cowardly most

crafty and most ignoble instincts a priests attack a parasites

attack a vampyrism of pale subterranean leeches when the natural

consequences of an act are no longer natural but are thought to

be conjured up by phantom concepts of superstition by god by

spirits and by souls as merely moral consequences in the form

of rewards punishments hints and educational meansthen the whole

basis of knowledge is destroyedthen the greatest crime against man

has been perpetratedsin i repeat this form of selfpollution par

excellence on the part of man was invented in order to make science

culture and every elevation and noble trait in man quite impossible by

means of the invention of sin the priest is able to rule
50
i cannot here dispense with a psychology of faith and of the

faithful which will naturally be to the advantage of the faithful

if today therepg 201 are still many who do not know how very indecent it

is to be a believeror to what extent such a state is the sign

of decadence and of the broken will to lifethey will know it no

later than tomorrow my voice can make even those hear who are hard

of hearingif perchance my ears have not deceived me it seems that

among christians there is such a thing as a kind of criterion of truth

which is called the proof of power faith saveth therefore it

is trueit might be objected here that it is precisely salvation

which is not proved but only promised salvation is bound up with

the condition faithone shall be saved because one has

faith but how prove that that which the priest promises to the

faithful really will take place to wit the beyond which defies

all demonstrationthe assumed proof of power is at bottom once

again only a belief in the fact that the effect which faith promises

will not fail to take place in a formula i believe that faith

savethconsequently it is truebut with this we are at the end

of our tether this consequently would be the absurdum itself as

a criterion of truthlet us be indulgent enough to assume however

that salvation is proved by faith not only desired and not

merely promised by the somewhat suspicious lips of a priest could

salvationor in technical terminology happinessever be a proof

of truth so little is it so that when pleasurable sensations make

their influence felt in replying to the question what is true they

furnish almost the contradiction of truth or at any rate they make

it in the highest degree suspicious the proof through happiness

is a proof of happinessandpg 202 nothing else why in the world should

we take it for granted that true judgments cause more pleasure than

false ones and that in accordance with a preestablished harmony they

necessarily bring pleasant feelings in their wakethe experience of

all strict and profound minds teaches the reverse every inch of

truth has been conquered only after a struggle almost everything to

which our heart our love and our trust in life cleaves has had to be

sacrificed for it greatness of soul is necessary for this the service

of truth is the hardest of all serviceswhat then is meant by honesty

in things intellectual it means that a man is severe towards his own

heart that he scorns beautiful feelings and that he makes a matter

of conscience out of every yea and nayfaith saveth consequently

it lies
51
the fact that faith may in certain circumstances save the fact that

salvation as the result of an ide fixe does not constitute a true

idea the fact that faith moves no mountains but may very readily

raise them where previously they did not existall these things are

made sufficiently clear by a mere casual stroll through a lunatic

asylum of course no priest would find this sufficient for he

instinctively denies that illness is illness or that lunatic asylums

are lunatic asylums christianity is in need of illness just as

ancient greece was in need of a superabundance of health the actual

ulterior motive of the whole of the churchs system of salvation

is to make people ill and is not the church itself the catholic

madhouse as an ultimatepg 203 idealthe earth as a whole converted into a

madhousethe kind of religious man which the church aims at producing

is a typical decadent the moment of time at which a religious crisis

attains the ascendancy over a people is always characterised by

nerveepidemics the inner world of the religious man is ridiculously

like the inner world of overirritable and exhausted people the

highest states which christianity holds up to mankind as the value

of values are epileptic in characterthe church has pronounced only

madmen or great swindlers in majorem dei honorem holy once i

ventured to characterise the whole of the christian training of penance

and salvation which nowadays is best studied in england as a folie

circulaire methodically generated upon a soil which of course is

already prepared for itthat is to say which is thoroughly morbid

not every one who likes can be a christian no man is converted

to christianityhe must be sick enough for it  we others who

possess enough courage both for health and for contempt how rightly

we may despise a religion which taught men to misunderstand the

body i which would not rid itself of the superstitions of the soul

which made a virtue of taking inadequate nourishment which in health

combats a sort of enemy devil temptation which persuaded itself that

it was possible to bear a perfect soul about in a cadaverous body

and which to this end had to make up for itself a new concept of

perfection a pale sickly idiotically gushing idealsocalled

holinessholiness which in itself is simply a symptom ofpg 204 an

impoverished enervated and incurably deteriorated body the

movement of christianity as a european movement was from first to

last a general accumulation of the ruck and scum of all sorts and

kinds and these by means of christianity aspire to power it

does not express the downfall of a race it is rather a conglomerate

assembly of all the decadent elements from everywhere which seek each

other and crowd together it was not as some believe the corruption

of antiquity of noble antiquity which made christianity possible

the learned idiocy which nowadays tries to support such a notion cannot

be too severely contradicted at the time when the morbid and corrupted

chandala classes became christianised in the whole of the imperium

the very contrary type nobility was extant in its finest and

maturest forms the greatest number became master the democracy of

christian instincts triumphed christianity was not national it

was not determined by raceit appealed to all the disinherited forms

of life it had its allies everywhere christianity is built upon the

rancour of the sick its instinct is directed against the sound

against health everything wellconstituted proud highspirited

and beautiful is offensive to its ears and eyes again i remind you

of st pauls priceless words and god hath chosen the weak things

of the world the foolish things of the world and base things of

the world and things which are despised this was the formula in

hoc signo decadence triumphedgod on the crossdoes no one yet

understand the terrible ulterior motive of thispg 205 symboleverything

that suffers everything that hangs on the cross is divine all

of us hang on the cross consequently we are divine  we alone are

divine christianity was a victory a nobler type of character

perished through itchristianity has been humanitys greatest

misfortune hitherto
52
christianity also stands opposed to everything happily constituted

in the mindit can make use only of morbid reason as christian

reason it takes the side of everything idiotic it utters a curse

upon intellect upon the superbia of the healthy intellect since

illness belongs to the essence of christianity the typically christian

state faith must also be a form of illness and all straight

honest and scientific roads to knowledge must be repudiated by the

church as forbidden doubt in itself is already a sin the total

lack of psychological cleanliness in the priest which reveals itself

in his look is a result of decadence hysterical women as also

children with scrofulous constitutions should be observed as a proof

of how invariably instinctive falsity the love of lying for the sake

of lying and the in ability either to look or to walk straight are

the expression of decadence faith simply means the refusal to know

what is true the pious person the priest of both sexes is false

because he is ill his instinct demands that truth should not assert

its right anywhere that which makes ill is good that which proceeds

from abundance from superabundance and from power is evil that

is the view of the faithful the constraint to liethat ispg 206 the

sign by which i recognise every predetermined theologiananother

characteristic of the theologian is his lack of capacity for

philology what i mean here by the word philology is in a general

sense to be understood as the art of reading well of being able to

take account of facts without falsifying them by interpretation

without losing either caution patience or subtlety owing to ones

desire to understand philology as ephexis8 in interpretation

whether one be dealing with books newspaper reports human destinies

or meteorological recordsnot to speak of the salvation of the

soul  the manner in which a theologian whether in berlin or in

rome interprets a verse from the scriptures or an experience or

the triumph of his nations army for instance under the superior

guiding light of davids psalms is always so exceedingly daring

that it is enough to make a philologists hair stand on end and what

is he to do when pietists and other cows from swabia explain their

miserable everyday lives in their smoky hovels by means of the finger

of god a miracle of grace of providence of experiences of

salvation the most modest effort of the intellect not to speak of

decent feeling ought at least to lead these interpreters to convince

themselves of the absolute childishness and unworthiness of any such

abuse of the dexterity of gods fingers however small an amount of

loving piety we mightpg 207 possess a god who cured us in time of a cold in

the nose or who arranged for us to enter a carriage just at the moment

when a cloud burst over our heads would be such an absurd god that he

would have to be abolished even if he existed9 god as a domestic

servant as a postman as a general providerin short merely a word

for the most foolish kind of accidents divine providence as it

is believed in today by almost every third man in cultured germany

would be an argument against god in fact it would be the strongest

argument against god that could be imagined and in any case it is an

argument against the germans
53
the notion that martyrs prove anything at all in favour of a thing

is so exceedingly doubtful that i would fain deny that there has ever

yet existed a martyr who had anything to do with truth in the very

manner in which a martyr flings his little parcel of truth at the

head of the world such a low degree of intellectual honesty and such

obtuseness in regard to the question truth makes itself felt that

one never requires to refute a martyr truth is not a thing which one

might have and another be withoutpg 208 only peasants or peasantapostles

after the style of luther can think like this about truth you may be

quite sure that the greater a mans degree of conscientiousness may

be in matters intellectual the more modest he will show himself on

this point to know about five things and with a subtle wave of the

hand to refuse to know others  truth as it is understood by

every prophet every sectarian every free thinker every socialist and

every churchman is an absolute proof of the fact that these people

havent even begun that discipline of the mind and that process of

selfmastery which is necessary for the discovery of any small even

exceedingly small truthincidentally the deaths of martyrs have

been a great misfortune in the history of the world they led people

astray the conclusion which all idiots women and common people

come to that there must be something in a cause for which someone lays

down his life or which as in the case of primitive christianity

provokes an epidemic of sacrificesthis conclusion put a tremendous

check upon all investigation upon the spirit of investigation and of

caution martyrs have harmed the cause of truth  even to this day

it only requires the crude fact of persecution in order to create an

honourable name for any obscure sect who does not matter in the least

what is a cause actually changed in any way by the fact that some

one has laid down his life for it an error which becomes honourable

is simply an error that possesses one seductive charm the more do

you suppose dear theologians that we shall give you the chance of

acting the martyrs for your liesa thing is refuted by being laidpg 209

respectfully on ice and theologians are refuted in the same way this

was precisely the worldhistoric foolishness of all persecutors they

lent the thing they combated a semblance of honour by conferring the

fascination of martyrdom upon it women still lie prostrate before

an error today because they have been told that some one died on the

cross for it is the cross then an argumentbut concerning all these

things one person alone has said what mankind has been in need of for

thousands of yearszarathustra
letters of blood did they write on the way they went and their folly

taught that truth is proved by blood
but blood is the very worst testimony of truth blood poisoneth even

the purest teaching and turneth it into delusion and into blood feuds
and when a man goeth through fire for his teachingwhat does that

prove verily it is more when out of ones own burning springeth ones

own teaching10
54
do not allow yourselves to be deceived great minds are sceptical

zarathustra is a sceptic strength and the freedom which proceeds

from the power and excessive power of the mind manifests itself

through scepticism men of conviction are of no account whatever

in regard to any principles of value or of nonvalue convictions

are prisons they never see far enough they do not look down from

a sufficient height but in order to have anypg 210 say in questions of

value and nonvalue a man must see five hundred convictions beneath

himbehind him a spirit who desires great things and who also

desires the means thereto is necessarily a sceptic freedom from every

kind of conviction belongs to strength to the ability to open

ones eyes freely the great passion of a sceptic the basis and

power of his being which is more enlightened and more despotic than he

is himself enlists all his intellect into its service it makes him

unscrupulous it even gives him the courage to employ unholy means

in certain circumstances it even allows him convictions conviction

as a means much is achieved merely by means of a conviction great

passion makes use of and consumes convictions it does not submit to

themit knows that it is a sovereign power conversely the need of

faith of anything either absolutely affirmative or negative carlylism

if i may be allowed this expression is the need of weakness

the man of beliefs the believer of every sort and condition is

necessarily a dependent manhe is one who cannot regard himself as

an aim who cannot postulate aims from the promptings of his own heart

the believer does not belong to himself he can be only a means

he must be used up he is in need of someone who uses him up his

instinct accords the highest honour to a morality of selfabnegation

everything in him his prudence his experience his vanity persuade

him to adopt this morality every sort of belief is in itself an

expression of selfdenial of selfestrangement  if one considers

how necessary a regulating code of conduct is to the majority of

people apg 211 code of conduct which constrains them and fixes them from

outside and how control or in a higher sense slavery is the only

and ultimate condition under which the weakwilled man and especially

woman flourish one also understands conviction faith the man

of conviction finds in the latter his backbone to be blind to

many things to be impartial about nothing to belong always to a

particular side to hold a strict and necessary point of view in all

matters of valuesthese are the only conditions under which such a man

can survive at all but all this is the reverse of the antagonist

of the truthful manof truth the believer is not at liberty to

have a conscience for the question true and untrue to be upright

on this point would mean his immediate downfall the pathological

limitations of his standpoint convert the convinced man into the

fanaticsavonarola luther rousseau robespierre saintsimonthese

are the reverse type of the strong spirit that has become free but

the grandiose poses of these morbid spirits of these epileptics

of ideas exercise an influence over the massesfanatics are

picturesque mankind prefers to look at poses than to listen to reason
55
one step further in the psychology of conviction of faith it

is already some time since i first thought of considering whether

convictions were not perhaps more dangerous enemies of truth than lies

human alltoohuman part i aphs 54 and 483 now i would fain put

the decisive questionpg 212 is there any difference at all between a lie

and a convictionall the world believes that there is but what in

heavens name does not all the world believe every conviction has its

history its preliminary stages its period of groping and of mistakes

it becomes a conviction only after it has not been one for a long

time only after it has scarcely been one for a long time what

might not falsehood be the embryonic form of convictionat times

all that is required is a change of personality very often what was

a lie in the father becomes a conviction in the soni call a lie

to refuse to see something that one sees to refuse to see it exactly

as one sees it whether a lie is perpetrated before witnesses or not

is beside the pointthe most common sort of lie is the one uttered

to ones self to lie to others is relatively exceptional now this

refusal to see what one sees this refusal to see a thing exactly as

one sees it is almost the first condition for all those who belong

to a party in any sense whatsoever the man who belongs to a party

perforce becomes a liar german historians for instance are convinced

that rome stood for despotism whereas the teutons introduced the

spirit of freedom into the world what difference is there between

this conviction and a lie after this is it to be wondered at that

all parties including german historians instinctively adopt the

grandiloquent phraseology of moralitythat morality almost owes

its survival to the fact that the man who belongs to a party no

matter what it may be is in need of morality every momentthis

is our conviction we confess it to the wholepg 213 world we live and die

for itlet us respect every thing that has a convictioni have

actually heard antisemites speak in this way on the contrary my dear

sirs an antisemite does not become the least bit more respectable

because he lies on principle priests who in such matters are

more subtle and who perfectly understand the objection to which the

idea of a conviction lies openthat is to say of a falsehood which

is perpetrated on principle because it serves a purpose borrowed

from the jews the prudent measure of setting the concept god will

of god revelation of god at this place kant too with his

categorical imperative was on the same road this was his practical

reasonthere are some questions in which it is not given to man

to decide between true and false all the principal questions all

the principal problems of value stand beyond human reason to

comprehend the limits of reasonthis alone is genuine philosophy for

what purpose did god give man revelation would god have done anything

superfluous man cannot of his own accord know what is good and what is

evil that is why god taught man his will moral the priest does

not lie such questions as truth or falseness have nothing to do

with the things concerning which the priest speaks such things do not

allow of lying for in order to lie it would be necessary to know

what is true in this respect but that is precisely what man cannot

know hence the priest is only the mouthpiece of godthis sort of

sacerdotal syllogism is by no means exclusively judaic or christian

the rightpg 214 to lie and the prudent measure of revelation belongs

to the priestly type whether of decadent periods or of pagan times

pagans are all those who say yea to life and to whom god is the

word for the great yea to all things the law the will of god

the holy book and inspirationall these things are merely words

for the conditions under which the priest attains to power and with

which he maintains his powerthese concepts are to be found at the

base of all sacerdotal organisations of all priestly or philosophical

and ecclesiastical governments the holy lie which is common to

confucius to the lawbook of manu to muhamed and to the christian

church is not even absent in plato truth is here this phrase

means wherever it is uttered the priest lies
56
after all the question is to what end are falsehoods perpetrated

the fact that in christianity holy ends are entirely absent

constitutes my objection to the means it employs its ends are only

bad ends the poisoning the calumniation and the denial of life

the contempt of the body the degradation and selfpollution of man by

virtue of the concept sinconsequently its means are bad as wellmy

feelings are quite the reverse when i read the lawbook of manu an

incomparably superior and more intellectual work which it would be

a sin against the spirit even to mention in the same breath with

the bible you will guess immediately why it has a genuine philosophy

behind it in it not merely an evilsmelling jewish distillation

of rabbinism andpg 215 superstitionit gives something to chew even

to the most fastidious psychologist and not to forget the most

important point of all it is fundamentally different from every kind

of bible by means of it the noble classes the philosophers and the

warriors guard and guide the masses it is replete with noble values

it is filled with a feeling of perfection with a saying of yea to

life and a triumphant sense of wellbeing in regard to itself and to

lifethe sun shines upon the whole bookall those things which

christianity smothers with its bottomless vulgarity procreation

woman marriage are here treated with earnestness with revere nee

with love and confidence how can one possibly place in the hands of

children and women a book that contains those vile words to avoid

fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman

have her own husband  it is better to marry than to burn11

and is it decent to be a christian so long as the very origin of

man is christianisedthat is to say befouled by the idea of the

immaculata conceptio  i know of no book in which so many delicate

and kindly things are said to woman as in the lawrook of manu these

old greybeards and saints have a manner of being gallant to women

which perhaps cannot be surpassed the mouth of a woman says manu

on one occasion the breast of a maiden the prayer of a child and

the smoke of the sacrifice are always pure elsewhere he says there

is nothing purer than the light of the sun the shadow cast by a cow

air water fire and the breath of a maiden and finallyperhaps this

is also a holy lieall thepg 216 openings of the body above the navel are

pure all those below the navel are impure only in a maiden is the

whole body pure
57
the unholiness of christian means is caught in flagranti if only

the end aspired to by christianity be compared with that of the

lawbook of manu if only these two utterly opposed aims be put under

a strong light the critic of christianity simply cannot avoid making

christianity contemptiblea lawbook like that of manu comes into

being like every good lawbook it epitomises the experience the

precautionary measures and the experimental morality of long ages

it settles things definitely it no longer creates the prerequisite

for a codification of this kind is the recognition of the fact that

the means which procure authority for a truth to which it has cost

both time and great pains to attain are fundamentally different from

those with which that same truth would be proved a lawbook never

relates the utility the reasons the preliminary casuistry of a

law for it would be precisely in this way that it would forfeit its

imperative tone the thou shalt the first condition of its being

obeyed the problem lies exactly in thisat a certain stage in the

development of a people the most farseeing class within it that is

to say the class that sees farthest backwards and forwards declares

the experience of how its fellowcreatures ought to livecan

liveto be finally settled its object is to reap as rich and as

complete a harvest as possible in return for the ages of experiment

and terrible experience it has traversed consequently that whichpg 217

has to be avoided above all is any further experimentation the

continuation of the state when values are still fluid the testing

choosing and criticising of values in infinitum  against all this a

double wall is built up in the first place revelation which is the

assumption that the rationale of every law is not human in its origin

that it was not sought and found after ages of error but that it is

divine in its origin completely and utterly without a history gift a

miracle a mere communication and secondly tradition which is

the assumption that the law has obtained since the most primeval times

that it is impious and a crime against ones ancestors to attempt to

doubt it the authority of law is established on the principles god

gave it the ancestors lived itthe superior reason of such a

procedure lies in the intention to draw consciousness off step by step

from that mode of life which has been recognised as correct ie

proved after enormous and carefully examined experience so that

perfect automatism of the instincts may be attainedthis being the

only possible basis of all mastery of every kind of perfection in

the art of life to draw up a lawbook like manus is tantamount

to granting a people mastership for the future perfection for the

futurethe right to aspire to the highest art of life to that

end it must be made unconscious this is the object of every holy

liethe order of castes the highest the dominating law is only

the sanction of a natural order of a natural legislation of the

first rank over which no arbitrary innovation no modern idea has

any power every healthy society falls into three distinct types which

reciprocallypg 218 condition one another and which gravitate differently in

the physiological sense and each of these has its own hygiene its

own sphere of work its own special feeling of perfection and its

own mastership it is nature not manu that separates from the rest

those individuals preponderating in intellectual power those excelling

in muscular strength and temperament and the third class which is

distinguished neither in one way nor the other the mediocrethe

latter as the greatest number the former as the lite the superior

castei call them the fewesthas as the perfect caste the

privileges of the fewest it devolves upon them to represent happiness

beauty and goodness on earth only the most intellectual men have

the right to beauty to the beautiful only in them is goodness not

weakness pulchrum est paucorum hominum goodness is a privilege

on the other hand there is nothing which they should be more strictly

forbidden than repulsive manners or a pessimistic look a look that

makes everything seem uglyor even indignation at the general

aspect of things indignation is the privilege of the chandala and so

is pessimism the world is perfectthat is what the instinct of

the most intellectual says the yeasaying instinct imperfection

every kind of inferiority to us distance the pathos of distance

even the chandala belongs to this perfection the most intellectual

men as the strongest find their happiness where others meet

with their ruin in the labyrinth in hardness towards themselves

and others in endeavour their delight is selfmastery with them

asceticism becomes a second nature a need anpg 219 instinct they regard

a difficult task as their privilege to play with burdens which crush

their fellows is to them a recreation knowledge a form of

asceticismthey are the most honourable kind of men but that does

not prevent them from being the most cheerful and most gracious they

rule not because they will but because they are they are not at

liberty to take a second placethe second in rank are the guardians

of the law the custodians of order and of security the noble

warriors the king above all as the highest formula of the warrior

the judge and keeper of the law the second in rank are the executive

of the most intellectual the nearest to them in duty relieving them

of all that is coarse in the work of rulingtheir retinue their

right hand their best disciples in all this i repeat there is

nothing arbitrary nothing artificial that which is otherwise is

artificialby that which is otherwise nature is put to shame the

order of castes and the order of rank merely formulates the supreme

law of life itself the differentiation of the three types is necessary

for the maintenance of society and for enabling higher and highest

types to be rearedthe inequality of rights is the only condition

of there being rights at alla right is a privilege and in his

way each has his privilege let us not underestimate the privileges

of the mediocre life always gets harder towards the summitthe

cold increases responsibility increases a high civilisation is a

pyramid it can stand only upon a broad base its first prerequisite is

a strongly and soundly consolidated mediocrity handicraft commerce

agriculture science the greater part ofpg 220 artin a word the whole

range of professional and business callings is compatible only with

mediocre ability and ambition such pursuits would be out of place

among exceptions the instinct pertaining thereto would oppose not

only aristocracy but anarchy as well the fact that one is publicly

useful a wheel a function presupposes a certain natural destiny it

is not society but the only kind of happiness of which the great

majority are capable that makes them intelligent machines for the

mediocre it is a joy to be mediocre in them mastery in one thing a

speciality is a natural instinct it would be absolutely unworthy of

a profound thinker to see any objection in mediocrity per se for

in itself it is the first essential condition under which exceptions

are possible a high culture is determined by it when the exceptional

man treats the mediocre with more tender care than he does himself or

his equals this is not mere courtesy of heart on his partbut simply

his duty  whom do i hate most among the rabble of the present

day the socialistic rabble the chandala apostles who undermine the

working mans instinct his happiness and his feeling of contentedness

with his insignificant existencewho make him envious and who teach

him revenge  the wrong never lies in unequal rights it lies in the

claim to equal rights what is bad but i have already replied to

this everything that proceeds from weakness envy and revengethe

anarchist and the christian are offspring of the same womb
58
in point of fact it matters greatly to what endpg 221 one lies whether one

preserves or destroys by means of falsehood it is quite justifiable

to bracket the christian and the anarchist together their object

their instinct is concerned only with destruction the proof of this

proposition can be read quite plainly from history history spells it

with appalling distinctness whereas we have just seen a religious

legislation whose object was to render the highest possible means of

making life flourish and of making a grand organisation of society

eternalchristianity found its mission in putting an end to such an

organisation precisely because life flourishes through it in the

one case the net profit to the credit of reason acquired through

long ages of experiment and of insecurity is applied usefully to the

most remote ends and the harvest which is as large as rich and

as complete as possible is reaped and garnered in the other case

on the contrary the harvest is blighted in a single night that

which stood there re perennius the imperium romanum the most

magnificent form of organisation under difficult conditions that has

ever been achieved and compared with which everything that preceded

and everything which followed it is mere patchwork gimcrackery

and dilettantismthose holy anarchists made it their piety to

destroy the worldthat is to say the imperium romanum until

no two stones were left standing one on the otheruntil even the

teutons and other clodhoppers were able to become master of it the

christian and the anarchist are both decadents they are both incapable

of acting in any other way than disintegratingly poisonously and

witheringlypg 222 like bloodsuckers they are both actuated by an

instinct of mortal hatred of everything that stands erect that is

great that is lasting and that is a guarantee of the future

christianity was the vampire of the imperium romanumin a night

it shattered the stupendous achievement of the romans which was to

acquire the territory for a vast civilisation which could bide its

timedoes no one understand this yet the imperium romanum that

we know and which the history of the roman province teaches us to

know ever more thoroughly this most admirable work of art on a grand

scale was the beginning its construction was calculated to prove

its worth by millenniumsunto this day nothing has ever again been

built in this fashion nor have men even dreamt since of building on

this scale sub specie aternithis organisation was sufficiently

firm to withstand bad emperors the accident of personalities must

have nothing to do with such mattersthe first principle of all

great architecture but it was not sufficiently firm to resist the

corruptest form of corruption to resist the christians these

stealthy cankerworms which under the shadow of night mist and

duplicity insinuated themselves into the company of every individual

and proceeded to drain him of all seriousness for real things

of all his instinct for realities this cowardly effeminate and

sugary gang have step by step alienated all souls from this colossal

edificethose valuable virile and noble natures who felt that

the cause of rome was their own personal cause their own personal

seriousness their own personal pride the stealth of the bigot

thepg 223 secrecy of the conventicle concepts as black as hell such as

the sacrifice of the innocent the unto mystica in the drinking

of blood above all the slowly kindled fire of revenge of chandala

revengesuch things became master of rome the same kind of religion

on the preexistent form of which epicurus had waged war one has

only to read lucretius in order to understand what epicurus combated

not paganism but christianity that is to say the corruption of

souls through the concept of guilt through the concept of punishment

and immortality he combated the subterranean cults the whole of

latent christianityto deny immortality was at that time a genuine

deliveranceand epicurus had triumphed every respectable thinker

in the roman empire was an epicurean then st paul appeared  st

paul the chandala hatred against rome against the world the jew

the eternal jew par excellence become flesh and genius  what

he divined was how by the help of the small sectarian christian

movement independent of judaism a universal conflagration could be

kindled how with the symbol of the god on the cross everything

submerged everything secretly insurrectionary the whole offspring

of anarchical intrigues could be gathered together to constitute an

enormous power for salvation is of the jewschristianity is

the formula for the supersession and epitomising of all kinds of

subterranean cults that of osiris of the great mother of mithras for

example st pauls genius consisted in his discovery of this in this

matter his instinct was so certain that regardless of doing violence

to truth he laid thepg 224 ideas by means of which those chandala religions

fascinated upon the very lips of the saviour he had invented and

not only upon his lipsthat he made out of him something which even

a mithras priest could understand this was his moment of damascus

he saw that he had need of the belief in immortality in order to

depreciate the world that the notion of hell would become master

of rome that with a beyond this life can be killed  nihilist

the whole labour of the ancient world in vain i am at a loss for a

word which could express my feelings at something so atrociousand

in view of the fact that its labour was only preparatory that with

adamantine selfconsciousness it laid the substructure alone to

a work which was to last millenniums the whole significance of

the ancient world was certainly in vain what was the use of the

greeks what was the use of the romansall the prerequisites of a

learned culture all the scientific methods already existed the great

and peerless art of reading well had already been establishedthat

indispensable condition to tradition to culture and to scientific

unity natural science hand in hand with mathematics and mechanics

was on the best possible roadthe sense for facts the last and

most valuable of all senses had its schools and its tradition was

already centuries old is this understood everything essential had

been discovered to make it possiblepg 225 for work to be begunmethods

and this cannot be said too often are the essential thing also the

most difficult thing while they moreover have to wage the longest war

against custom and indolence that which today we have successfully

reconquered for ourselves by dint of unspeakable selfdisciplinefor

in some way or other all of us still have the bad instincts the

christian instincts in our bodythe impartial eye for reality

complete uprightness in knowledgeall this was already there it

had been there over two thousand years before and in addition to this

there was also that excellent and subtle tact and taste not in the

form of brain drilling not in the form of german culture with the

manners of a boor but incarnate manifesting itself in mens bearing

and in their instinctin short constituting reality all this

christian agitatorsst augustine for instancein order to realise

in order to smell what filthy fellows came to the top in this

movement you would deceive yourselves utterly if you supposed that the

leaders of the christian agitation showed any lack of understanding

ah they were shrewd shrewd to the point of holiness were these

dear old fathers of the church i what they lack is something quite

different nature neglected themit forgot to give them a modest

dowry of decent of respectable and of cleanly instincts between

ourselves they are not even men if islam despises christianity it is

justified a thousand times over for islam presupposes men
60
christianity destroyed the harvest we might have reaped from the

culture of antiquity later it also destroyed our harvest of the

culture of islam the wonderful moorish world of spanish culture which

in its essence is more closely related to us and which appeals

more to our sense and taste than rome and greece was trampled to

deathi do not say by what kind of feet whybecause it owed

its origin to noble to manly instincts because it said yea to life

even that life so full of the rare and refined luxuries of the moors

 later on the crusaders waged war upon something before which it

would have been more seemly in them topg 227 grovel in the dusta culture

beside which even our nineteenth century would seem very poor and

very senileof course they wanted booty the orient was rich

for goodness sake let us forget our prejudices crusadessuperior

piracy that is all german nobilitythat is to say a viking nobility

at bottom was in its element in such wars the church was only too

well aware of how german nobility is to be won german nobility

was always the swiss guard of the church always at the service of

all the bad instincts of the church but it was well paid for it

all fancy the church having waged its deadly war upon everything

noble on earth precisely with the help of german swords german blood

and courage a host of painful questions might be raised on this

point german nobility scarcely takes a place in the history of higher

culture the reason of this is obvious christianity alcoholthe two

great means of corruption as a matter of fact choice ought to be

just as much out of the question between islam and christianity as

between an arab and a jew the decision is already selfevident nobody

is at liberty to exercise a choice in this matter a man is either of

the chandala or he is not  war with rome to the knife peace

here it is necessary to revive a memory which will be a hundred times

more painful to germans the germans have destroyed the last great

harvest of culture which was to be garnered for europeit destroyed

the renaissance does anybody at last understand will anybody

understand what the renaissance was the transvaluation of christian

values the attempt undertaken with all means all instincts and all

genius to make the opposite values the noble values triumph

hitherto there has been only this great war there has never yet

been a more decisive question than the renaissancemy question

is the question of the renaissancethere has never been a more

fundamental a more direct and a more severe attack delivered with

a whole front upon the centre of the foe to attack at the decisive

quarter at the very seat of christianity and there to place noble

values on the thronethat is to say to introduce them into the

instincts into the most fundamental needs and desires of those

sitting there i see before me a possibility perfectly magic in

its charm and glorious colouringit seems to me to scintillate

with all the quivering grandeur of refined beauty that there is

an art at work within it which is so divine so infernally divine

that one might seek through millenniums in vain for another such

possibility i see a spectacle so rich in meaning and so wonderfully

paradoxical to boot that it would be enough to make all the gods of

olympus rock with immortal laughtercsar borgia as pope 

do you understand mepg 229  very well then this would have been the

triumph which i alone am longing for todaythis would have swept

christianity awaywhat happened a german monk luther came to

rome this monk with all the vindictive instincts of an abortive

priest in his body foamed with rage over the renaissance in rome

instead of with the profoundest gratitude understanding the vast

miracle that had taken place the overcoming of christianity at its

headquartersthe fire of his hate knew only how to draw fresh fuel

from this spectacle a religious man thinks only of himselfluther

saw the corruption of the papacy when the very reverse stared him in

the face the old corruption the peceatum originate christianity

no longer sat upon the papal chair but life the triumph of

life the great yea to all lofty beautiful and daring things

and luther reinstated the church he attacked it the renaissance

thus became an event without meaning a great in vainah these

germans what have they not cost us already in vainthis has always

been the achievement of the germansthe reformation leibniz

kant and socalled german philosophy the wars of liberation the

empirein each case are in vain for something which had already

existed for something which cannot be recovered  i confess it

these germans are my enemies i despise every sort of uncleanliness

in concepts and valuations in them every kind of cowardice in the

face of every honest yea or nay for almost one thousand years now

they have tangled and confused everything they have laid their hands

on they have on theirpg 230 conscience all the halfmeasures all the

threeeighth measures of which europe is sick they also have the

most unclean the most incurable and the most irrefutable kind of

christianityprotestantismon their conscience if we shall never

be able to get rid of christianity the germans will be to blame
62
with this i will now conclude and pronounce my judgment i condemn

christianity and confront it with the most terrible accusation that

an accuser has ever had in his mouth to my mind it is the greatest

of all conceivable corruptions it has had the will to the last

imaginable corruption the christian church allowed nothing to escape

from its corruption it converted every value into its opposite every

truth into a he and every honest impulse into an ignominy of the

soul let anyone dare to speak to me of its humanitarian blessings

to abolish any sort of distress was opposed to its profoundest

interests its very existence depended on states of distress it

created states of distress in order to make itself immortal the

cancer germ of sin for instance the church was the first to enrich

mankind with this miserythe equality of souls before god this

falsehood this pretext for the rancunes of all the baseminded

this anarchist bomb of a concept which has ultimately become the

revolution the modern idea the principle of decay of the whole of

social orderthis is christian dynamite  the humanitarian

blessings of christianity to breed a selfcontradiction an art of

selfprofanation a will to lie at any price an aversionpg 231 a contempt

of all good and honest instincts out of humanitas is this what you

call the blessings of christianityparasitism as the only method of

the church sucking all the blood all the love all the hope of life

out of mankind with anmic and sacred ideals a beyond as the will to

deny all reality the cross as the trademark of the most subterranean

form of conspiracy that has ever existedagainst health beauty

wellconstitutedness bravery intellect kindliness of soul against

life itself
this eternal accusation against christianity i would fain write on all

walls wherever there are wallsi have letters with which i can make

even the blind see i call christianity the one great curse the one

enormous and innermost perversion the one great instinct of revenge

for which no means are too venomous too underhand too underground and

too pettyi call it the one immortal blemish of mankind
and time is reckoned from the dies nefastus upon which this

fatality came into beingfrom the first day of christianitywhy

not rather from its last dayfrom todaytransvaluation of all

values

pg 235
translators preface
the notes concerning the eternal recurrence in this volume are said

by mrs foersternietzsche to have been the first that nietzsche ever

wrote on the subject of his great doctrine this being so they must

have been composed towards the autumn of the year 1881
i have already pointed out elsewhere will to power vol ii

translators preface how much importance nietzsche himself ascribed

to this doctrine and how until the end he regarded it as the

inspiration which had led to his chief work thus spake zarathustra

for the details relating to its inception however i would refer the

reader to mrs foersternietzsches introduction to her brothers chief

work which was translated for the eleventh volume of this edition of

the complete works
in reading these notes it would be well to refer to nietzsches other

utterances on the subject which are to be found at the end of vol

ii of the will to power and also if possible to have recourse

to the original german text despite the greatest care i confess

that in some instances i have felt a little doubt as to the precise

english equivalent for the thoughts expressed under the heading

eternal recurrence and though i have attributed this difficulty to

the extreme novelty of the manner in which thepg 236 subject is presented

it is well that the reader should be aware that such doubt has been

entertained for i disbelieve utterly in mere verbal translation

however accurate and would question anybodys right to convert a

german sentence into englisheven though he were so perfect in

both languages as to be almost absolutely bilingualif he did not

completely grasp the thought behind the sentence
the writing of the collected explanatory notes to thus spake

zarathustra cannot be given any exact date some of them consist of

comments written down by nietzsche after the completion of the book

and kept as the nucleus of an actual commentary to zarathustra which

it seems to have been his intention one day to write while others

are merely memoranda and rough sketches probably written before the

completion of the work and which served the purpose of a draft of his

original plan the reader who knows thus spake zarathustra will be

able to tell wherein the book ultimately differed from the plan visible

in these preliminary notes
as an authoritative though alas all too fragmentary elucidation of a

few of the more obscure passages of zarathustra some of these notes

are of the greatest value and in paragraph 73 for instance there

is an interpretation of the fourth and last part which i myself would

have welcomed with great enthusiasm at the time when i was having my

first struggles with the spirit of this great german sages life work

 i eternal recurrence
1 the doctrine expounded and substantiated
1
the extent of universal energy is limited it is not infinite we

should beware of such excesses in our concepts consequently the number

of states changes combinations and evolutions of this energy

although it may be enormous and practically incalculable is at any

rate definite and not unlimited the time however in which this

universal energy works its changes is infinitethat is to say energy

remains eternally the same and is eternally activeat this moment an

infinity has already elapsed that is to say every possible evolution

must already have taken place consequently the present process of

evolution must be a repetition as was also the one before it as will

also be the one which will follow and so on forwards and backwards

inasmuch as the entire state of all forces continually returns

everything has existed an infinite number of times whether apart from

this anything exactly like something that formerly existed has ever

appeared is completely beyond proof it would seem that each complete

state of energy forms all qualities afresh even to the smallest

degree so that two different complete states could have nothing in

commonpg 238 is it to be supposed that in one and the same complete states

two precisely similar things could appearfor instance two leaves

i doubt it it would take for granted that they had both had an

absolutely similar origin and in that case we should have to assume

that right back in infinity two similar things had also existed despite

all the changes in the complete states and their creation of new

qualitiesan impossible assumption
2
formerly it was thought that unlimited energy was a necessary corollary

to unlimited activity in time and that this energy could be exhausted

by no form of consumption now it is thought that energy remains

constant and docs not require to be infinite it is eternally active

but it is no longer able eternally to create new forms it must repeat

itself that is my conclusion
3
an incalculable number of complete states of energy have existed

but these have not been infinitely different for if they had been

unlimited energy would have been necessary the energy of the universe

can only have a given number of possible qualities
4
the endless evolution of new forms is a contradiction for it would

imply eternally increasing energy but whence would it grow whence

would it derive its nourishment and its surplus of nourishmentpg 239 the

assumption that the universe is an organism contradicts the very

essence of the organic
5
in what principle and belief is that decisive turning point in

philosophical thought best expressed which has come into being thanks

to the preponderance of the scientific spirit over the religious and

godcreating one we insist upon the fact that the world as a sum of

energy must not be regarded as unlimitedwe forbid ourselves the

concept infinite energy because it seems incompatible with the concept

energy
6
an unlimited number of new changes and states on the part of limited

energy is a contradiction however extensive one may imagine it to be

and however economical the changes may be provided it is infinite

we are therefore forced to conclude 1 either that the universe

began its activity at a given moment of time and will end in a similar

fashionbut the beginning of activity is absurd if a state of

equilibrium had been reached it would have persisted to all eternity

2 or there is no such thing as an endless number of changes but

a circle consisting of a definite number of them which continually

recurs activity is eternal the number of the products and states of

energy is limited
7
if all the possible combinations and relations of forces had not

already been exhausted then an infinity would not yet lie behind

us now sincepg 240 infinite time must be assumed no fresh possibility

can exist and everything must have appeared already and moreover an

infinite number of times
8
the present world of forces leads back to a state of greatest

simplicity in these forces it likewise leads forwards to such a

statecannot and must not both states be identical no incalculable

number of states can evolve out of a system of limited forces that

is to say out of a given quantity of energy which may be precisely

measured only when we falsely assume that space is unlimited and that

therefore energy gradually becomes dissipated can the final state be

an unproductive and lifeless one
9
first principlesthe last physical state of energy which we can

imagine must necessarily be the first also the absorption of energy

in latent energy must be the cause of the production of the most vital

energy for a highly positive state must follow a negative state space

like matter is a subjective form time is not the notion of space

first arose from the assumption that space could be empty but there is

no such thing as empty space everything is energy
we cannot think of that which moves and that which is moved together

but both these things constitute matter and space we isolate
10
concerning the resurrection of the worldoutpg 241 of two negatives when

they are forces a positive arises darkness comes of light opposed to

light cold arises from warmth opposed to warmth c c
11
an uncertain state of equilibrium occurs just as seldom in nature as

two absolutely equal triangles consequently anything like a static

state of energy in general is impossible if stability were possible it

would already have been reached
12
either complete equilibrium must in itself be an impossibility or

the changes of energy introduce themselves in the circular process

before that equilibrium which is in itself possible has appearedbut

it would be madness to ascribe a feeling of selfpreservation to

existence and the same applies to the conception of a contest of pain

and pleasure among atoms
13
physics supposes that energy may be divided up but every one of its

possibilities must first be adjusted to reality there can therefore

be no question of dividing energy into equal parts in every one of

its states it manifests a certain quality and qualities cannot be

subdivided hence a state of equilibrium in energy is impossible
14
if energy had ever reached a stage of equilibrium that stage would

have persisted it has thereforepg 242 never reached such a stage the

present condition of things contradicts this assumption if we assume

that there has ever been a state absolutely like the present one this

assumption is in no wise refuted by the present state for among

all the endless possibilities this case must already have occurred

as an infinity is already behind us if equilibrium were possible it

would already have been reachedand if this momentary state has

already existed then that which bore it and the previous one also would

likewise have existed and so on backwardsand from this it follows

that it has already existed not only twice but three timesjust as it

will exist again not only twice but three timesin fact an infinite

number of times backwards and forwards that is to say the whole

process of becoming consists of a repetition of a definite number of

precisely similar statesclearly the human brain cannot be left to

imagine the whole series of possibilities but in any case quite apart

from our ability to judge or our inability to conceive the whole range

of possibilities the present state at least is a possible onebecause

it is a real one we should therefore say in the event of the number

of possibilities not being infinite and assuming that in the course of

unlimited time a limited number of these must appear all real states

must have been preceded by similar states because from every given

moment a whole infinity is to be calculated backwards the stability of

forces and their equilibrium is a possible alternative but it has not

been reached consequently the number of possibilities is greater than

the number of real states the fact that nothing similar recurs couldpg 243

not be explained by appealing to accident but only by supposing that a

certain intention that no similar things should recur were actually

inherent in the essence of energy for if we grant that the number of

cases is enormous the occurrence of like cases is more probable than

absolute disparity
15
let us think backwards a moment if the world had a goal this goal

must have been reached if a certain unintentional final state

existed for the world this state also would have been reached if

it were in any way capable of a stationary or stable condition and

if in the whole course of its existence only one second of being in

the strict sense of the word had been possible then there could

no longer be such a process as evolution and therefore no thinking

and no observing of such a process if on the other hand the world

were something which continually renovated itself it would then be

understood to be something miraculous and free to create itselfin

fact something divine eternal renovation presupposes that energy

voluntarily increases itself that it not only has the intention but

also the power to avoid repeating itself or to avoid returning into a

previous form and that every instant it adjusts itself in every one of

its movements to prevent such a contingencyor that it was incapable

of returning to a state it had already passed through that would

mean that the whole sum of energy was not constant any more than its

attributes were but a sum of energy which would be inconstant and which

would fluctuate is quite unthinkable let us not indulgepg 244 our fancy

any longer with unthinkable things in order to fall once more before

the concept of a creator multiplication out of nothing reduction

out of nothing absolute arbitrariness and freedom in growth and in

qualities
16
he who does not believe in the circular process of the universe must

pin his faith to an arbitrary godthus my doctrine becomes necessary

as opposed to all that has been said hitherto in matters of theism
17
the hypothesis which i would oppose to that of the eternal circular

processwould it be just as possible to explain the laws of the

mechanical world as exceptions and seemingly as accidents among the

things of the universe as one possibility only among an incalculable

number of possibilities would it be possible to regard ourselves

as accidentally thrust into this corner of the mechanical universal

arrangementthat all chemical philosophy is likewise an exception

and an accident in the worlds economy and finally that organic life

is a mere exception and accident in the chemical world should we have

to assume as the most general form of existence a world which was

not yet mechanical which was outside all mechanical laws although

accessible to themand that as a matter of fact this world would

be the most general now and for evermore so that the origin of the

mechanical world would be a lawless game which would ultimately acquire

such consistency as the organic laws seem to have nowpg 245 from our point

of view so that all our mechanical laws would be not eternal but

evolved and would have survived innumerable different mechanical

laws or that they had attained supremacy in isolated corners of the

world and not in othersit would seem that we need caprice actual

lawlessness and only a capacity for law a primeval state of stupidity

which is not even able to concern itself with mechanics the origin of

qualities presupposes the existence of quantities and these for their

part might arise from a thousand kinds of mechanical processes
is not the existence of some sort of irregularity and incomplete

circular form in the world about us a sufficient refutation of

the regular circularity of everything that exists whence comes

this variety within the circular process is not everything far too

complicated to have been the outcome of unity and are not the many

chemical laws and likewise the organic species and forms inexplicable

as the result of homogeneity or of dualitysupposing there were

such a thing as a regular contracting energy in all the centres of

force in the universe the question would be whence could the most

insignificant difference spring for then the whole world would have

to be resolved into innumerable completely equal rings and spheres of

existence and we should have an incalculable number of exactly equal

worlds side by side is it necessary for me to assume this must i

suppose that an eternal sequence of like worlds also involves eternal

juxtaposition of like worlds but the multifariousness and disorder

in the world which we have knownpg 246 hitherto contradicts this no such

universal similarity has existed in evolution for in that case even

for our part of the cosmos a regular spherical form must have been

formed should the production of qualities not be subject to any strict

laws can it be possible that different things have been derived from

energy arbitrarily is the conformity to law which we observe

perhaps only a deception is it possible that it is not a primeval law

is it possible that the multifariousness of qualities even in our part

of the world is the result of the absolute occurrence of arbitrary

characteristics but that these characteristics no longer appear in our

corner of the globe or that our corner of existence has adopted a rule

which we call cause and effect when all the while it is no such thing

an arbitrary phenomenon become a rule as for instance oxygen and

hydrogen in chemistry is this rule simply a protracted kind of mood
18
if the universe had been able to become an organism it would have

become one already as a whole we must try and regard it in the

light of a thing as remote as possible from the organic i believe

that even our chemical affinity and coherence may be perhaps recently

evolved and that these appearances only occur in certain corners of

the universe at certain epochs let us believe in absolute necessity

in the universe but let us guard against postulating any sort of law

even if it be a primitive and mechanical one of our own experience

as ruling over the whole and constituting one of its eternalpg 247

characteristicsall chemical qualities might have been evolved and

might disappear and return innumerable characteristics might have been

developed which for usfrom our limited point of view in time and

space defy observation the transformation of a chemical quality may

perhaps now be taking place but so slowly that it escapes our most

delicate calculations
19
inorganic matter even though in most cases it may once have

been organic can have stored up no experienceit is always

without a pastl if the reverse were the case a repetition would be

impossiblefor then matter would for ever be producing new qualities

with new pasts
20
we must guard against ascribing any aspiration or any goal to this

circular process likewise we must not from the point of view of our

own needs regard it as either monotonous or foolish c we may grant

that the greatest possible irrationality as also its reverse may be

an essential feature of it but we must not value it according to this

hypothesis rationality or irrationality cannot stand as attributes of

the universewe must not think of the law of this circular process as

a thing evolved by drawing false analogies with the circular motions

occurring within the circle there was no primitive chaos followed

gradually by a more harmonious and finally definite circular motion of

all forces on the contrary everything is eternal and unevolved if

there ever was a chaos of forces then that chaospg 248 itself was eternal

and was repeated at its particular moment of time in the turn of the

world wheel the circular process is not the outcome of evolution it

is a primitive principle like the quantum of energy and allows of no

exception or violation all becoming takes place within the circular

process and the quantum of energy which constitutes it therefore we

must not apply ephemeral processes like those for instance of heavenly

bodies of the ebb and flow of tides of day and night of the seasons

to the drawing of analogies for characterising the eternal circular

process
21
the chaos of the universe inasmuch as it excludes any aspiration to

a goal does not oppose the thought of the circular process the latter

is simply an irrational necessity absolutely free from any formal

ethical or sthetical significance arbitrariness in small things as in

great is completely lacking here
22
let us guard against believing that the universe has a tendency to

attain to certain forms or that it aims at becoming more beautiful

more perfect more complicated all that is anthropomorphism anarchy

ugliness formare unrelated concepts there is no such thing as

imperfection in the realm of mechanics
everything has returned sirius and the spider and thy thoughts at

this moment and this last thought of thine that all these things will

return
pg 249
23
our whole world consists of the ashes of an incalculable number of

living creatures and even if living matter is ever so little compared

with the whole everything has already been transformed into life once

before and thus the process goes on if we grant eternal time we must

assume the eternal change of matter
24
whoever thou mayest be beloved stranger whom i meet here for the

first time avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness

around us and above us and let me tell thee something of the thought

which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed

down its rays upon thee and every one as befits the nature of light
25
the world of energy suffers no diminution otherwise with eternal

time it would have grown weak and finally have perished altogether

the world of energy suffers no stationary state otherwise this would

already have been reached and the clock of the universe would be at

a standstill the world of energy does not therefore reach a state of

equilibrium for no instant in its career has it had rest its energy

and its movement have been the same for all time whatever state this

world could have reached must ere now have been attained and not

only once but an incalculable number of times this applies to this

very moment it has already been here once before and several times

and will recurpg 250 in the same way with all forces distributed as they

are today and the same holds good of the moment of time which bore

the present and of that which shall be the child of the present

fellowman your whole life like a sandglass will always be reversed

and will ever run out againa long minute of time will elapse until

all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel

of the cosmic process and then you will find every pain and every

pleasure every friend and every enemy every hope and every error

every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more and the whole

fabric of things that makes up your life this ring in which you are

but a grain will glitter afresh for ever and in every one of these

cycles of human life there will be one hour where for the first time

one man and then many will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal

recurrence of all thingsand for mankind this is always the hour of

noon
2 the effects of the doctrine upon mankind
26
how can we give weight to our inner life without making it evil and

fanatical towards people who think otherwise religious belief is

declining and man is beginning to regard himself as ephemeral and

unessential a point of view which is making him weak he does not

exercise so much effort in striving or enduring what he wants is

momentary enjoyment he would make things light for himselfand a good

deal of his spirit gets squandered in this endeavour
pg 251
27
the political mania at which i smile just as merrily as my

contemporaries smile at the religious mania of former times is above

all materialism a belief in the world and in the repudiation of a

beyond of a backworld the object of those who believe in the

latter is the wellbeing of the ephemeral individual that is why

socialism is its fruit for with socialism ephemeral individuals wish

to secure their happiness by means of socialisation they have no

reason to wait as those men had who believed in eternal souls in

eternal development and eternal amelioration my doctrine is live

so that thou mayest desire to live againthat is thy dutyfor in

any case thou wilt live again he unto whom striving is the greatest

happiness let him strive he unto whom peace is the greatest

happiness let him rest he unto whom subordination following

obedience is the greatest happiness let him obey all that is

necessary is that he should know what it is that gives him the highest

happiness and to fight shy of no means eternity is at stake
28
but if everything is necessary what control have i over my actions

thought and faith are a form of ballast which burden thee in addition

to other burdens thou mayest have and which are even more weighty than

the latter sayest thou that nutrition the land of thy birth air and

society change thee and determine thee well thy opinions do this to

a much greater degree for they even prescribepg 252 thy nourishment thy

land of adoption thy atmosphere and thy society for theeif thou

ever assimilatest the thought of thoughts it will also alter thee the

question which thou wilt have to answer before every deed that thou

doest is this such a deed as i am prepared to perform an incalculable

number of times is the best ballast
29
the mightiest of all thoughts absorbs a good deal of energy which

formerly stood at the disposal of other aspirations and in this way

it exercises a modifying influence it creates new laws of motion in

energy though no new energy but it is precisely in this respect that

there lies some possibility of determining new emotions and new desires

in men
30
let us try and discover how the thought that something gets repeated

has affected mankind hitherto the year for instance or periodical

illnesses waking and sleeping  even supposing the recurrence of

the cycle is only a probability or a possibility even a thought even

a possibility can shatter us and transform us it is not only feelings

and definite expectations that do this see what effect the thought of

eternal damnation has had
31
from the moment when this thought begins to prevail all colours will

change their hue and a new history will begin
pg 253
32
the history of the future this thought will tend to triumph ever more

and more and those who disbelieve in it will be forced according to

their nature ultimately to die out
he alone who will regard his existence as capable of eternal

recurrence will remain over but among such as these a state will be

possible of which the imagination of no utopist has ever dreamt
33
ye fancy that ye will have a long rest ere your second birth takes

placebut do not deceive yourselves twixt your last moment of

consciousness and the first ray of the dawn of your new life no time

will elapseas a flash of lightning will the space go by even though

living creatures think it is billions of years and are not even able

to reckon it timelessness and immediate rebirth are compatible once

intellect is eliminated
34
thou feelest that thou must soon take thy leave perhapsand the sunset

glow of this feeling pierces through thy happiness give heed to this

sign it means that thou lovest life and thyself and life as it has

hitherto affected thee and moulded theeand that thou cravest for its

eternitynon alia sed hac vita sempiterna
know also that transiency singeth its short song for ever afresh and

that at the sound of the first verse thou wilt almost die of longing

when thou thinkest that it might be for the last time
pg 254
35
let us stamp the impress of eternity upon our lives this thought

contains more than all the religions which taught us to contemn this

life as a thing ephemeral which bade us squint upwards to another and

indefinite existence
36
we must not strive after distant and unknown states of bliss and

blessings and acts of grace but we must live so that we would fain

live again and live for ever so to all eternityour duty is present

with us every instant
37
the leading tendencies 1 we must implant the love of life the

love of every mans own life in every conceivable way however each

individual may understand this love of self his neighbour will

acquiesce and will have to learn great tolerance towards it however

much it may often run counter to his tasteprovided the individual in

question really helps to increase his joy in his own life
2 we must all be one in our hostility towards everything and

everybody who tends to cast a slur upon the value of life towards

all gloomy dissatisfied and brooding natures we must prevent these

from procreating but our hostility itself must be a means to our joy

thus we shall laugh we shall mock and we shall exterminate without

bitterness i let this be our mortal combat
this life is thy eternal life
pg 255
38
what was the cause of the downfall of the alexandrian culture with all

its useful discoveries and its desire to investigate the nature of this

world it did not know how to lend this life its ultimate importance

the thought of a beyond was more important to it to teach anew in

this regard is still the most important thing of allperhaps if

metaphysics are applied to this life in the most emphatic wayas in

the case of my doctrine
39
this doctrine is lenient towards those who do not believe in it it

speaks of no hells and it contains no threats he who does not believe

in it has but a fleeting life in his consciousness
40
it would be terrible if we still believed in sin but whatever we may

do however often we may repeat it it is all innocent if the thought

of the eternal recurrence of all things does not overwhelm thee then

it is not thy fault and if it does overwhelm thee this does not stand

to thy merit eitherwe think more leniently of our forebears than

they themselves thought of themselves we mourn over the errors which

were to them constitutional but we do not mourn over their evil
41
let us guard against teaching such a doctrine as if it were a suddenly

discovered religion itpg 256 must percolate through slowly and whole

generations must build on it and become fruitful through itin order

that it may grow into a large tree which will shelter all posterity

what are the two thousand years in which christianity has maintained

its sway for the mightiest thought of all many millenniums will be

necessarylong long long will it have to remain puny and weak
42
for this thought we do not require thirty years of glory with drums

and fifes and thirty years of gravedigging followed by an eternity

of macaberesque stillness as is the case with so many other famous

thoughts
simple and wellnigh arid as it is this thought must not even require

eloquence to uphold it
43
are ye now prepared ye must have experienced every form of

scepticism and ye must have wallowed with voluptuousness in icecold

bathsotherwise ye have no right to this thought i wish to protect

myself against those who are overready to believe likewise against

those who gush over anything i would defend my doctrine in advance

it must be the religion of the freest most cheerful and most sublime

souls a delightful pastureland somewhere between golden ice and a pure

heaven
pg 259
 explanatory notes to thus spake zarathustra
1
all goals have been annihilated valuations are turning against each

other
people call him good who hearkens to the dictates of his own heart but

they also call him good who merely does his duty
people call the mild and conciliating man good but they also call him

good who is brave inflexible and severe
people call him good who does not do violence to himself but they also

call the heroes of selfmastery good
people call the absolute friend of truth good but they also call him

good who is pious and a transfigurer of things
people call him good who can obey his own voice but they also call the

devout man good
people call the noble and the haughty man good but also him who does

not despise and who does not assume condescending airs
people call him good who is kindhearted and who steps out of the way of

broils but he who thirsts for fight and triumph is also called good
people call him good who always wishes to be first but they also call

him good who does not wish to be ahead of anybody in anything
pg 260

we possess a powerful store of moral feelings but we have no goal

for them all they mutually contradict each other they have their

origin in different tables of values
there is a wonderful amount of moral power but there is no longer any

goal towards which all this power can be directed
3
all goals have been annihilated mankind must give themselves a fresh

goal it is an error to suppose that they had one they gave themselves

all the goals they ever had but the prerequisites of all previous

goals have been annihilated
science traces the course of things but points to no goal what it does

give consists of the fundamental facts upon which the new goal must be

based
4
the profound sterility of the nineteenth century i have not

encountered a single man who really had a new ideal to bring

forward the character of german music kept me hoping longest but

in vain a stronger type in which all our powers are synthetically

correlatedthis constitutes my faith
apparently everything is decadence we should so direct this movement

of decline that it may provide the strongest with a new form of

existence
5
the dissolution of morality in its practical consequences leads

to the atomistic individual andpg 261 further to the subdivision of the

individual into a quantity of partsabsolute liquefaction
that is why a goal is now more than ever necessary and love but a new

love
6
i say as long as your morality hung over me i breathed like one

asphyxiated that is why i throttled this snake i wished to live

consequently it had to die
7
as long as people are still forced to act that is to say as long as

commands are given synthesis the suppression of the moral man will

not be realised to be unable to be otherwise instincts and commanding

reason extending beyond any immediate object the ability to enjoy

ones own nature in action
8
none of them wish to bear the burden of the commander but they will

perform the most strenuous task if only thou commandest them
9
we must overcome the past in ourselves we must combine the instincts

afresh and direct the whole together to one goalan extremely

difficult undertaking it is not only the evil instincts which have to

be overcomethe socalled good instincts must be conquered also and

consecrated anew
10
no leaps must be made in virtue but everyone must be given a different

path not leading to thepg 262 highest development of each yet everyone may

be a bridge and an example for others
11
to help to pity to submit and to renounce personal attacks with a

good willthese things may make even insignificant and superficial

men tolerable to the eye such men must not be contradicted in their

belief that this good will is virtue in itself
12
man makes a deed valuable but how might a deed make man valuable
13
morality is the concern of those who cannot free themselves from

it for such people morality therefore belongs to the conditions of

existence it is impossible to refute conditions of existence the only

thing one can do is not to have them
14
if it were true that life did not deserve to be welcomed the moral

man precisely on account of his selfdenial and obligingness would

then be guilty of misusing his fellow to his own personal advantage
15
love thy neighbourthis would mean first and foremost let thy

neighbour go his own wayand it is precisely this kind of virtue that

is the most difficult
pg 263
16
the bad man as the parasite we must not be merely feasters and

gourmets of life this is ignoble
17
it is a noble sense which forbids our being only feasters and gourmets

of lifethis sense revolts against hedonism we want to perform

something in returnbut the fundamental feeling of the masses is that

one must live for nothingthat is their vulgarity
18
the converse valuations hold good for the lower among men in their

case therefore it is necessary to implant virtues they must be

elevated above their lives by means of absolute commands and terrible

taskmasters
19
what is required the new law must be made practicableand out of its

fulfilment the overcoming of this law and higher law must evolve

zarathustra defines the attitude towards law inasmuch as he suppresses

the law of laws which is morality
laws as the backbone they must be worked at and created by being

fulfilled the slavish attitude which has reigned hitherto towards law
20
the selfovercoming of zarathustra as the prototype of mankinds

selfovercoming for the benefit of superman to this end the overcoming

of morality is necessary
pg 264
21
the type of the lawgiver his development and his suffering what is

the purpose of giving laws at all
zarathustra is the herald who calls forth many lawgivers
22
individual instruments
1 the commanders the mightywho do not love unless it be that they

love the images according to which they create the rich in vitality

the versatile the free who overcome that which is extant
2 the obedient the emancipatedlove and reverence constitute their

happiness they have a sense of what is higher their deficiencies are

made whole by the sight of the lofty
3 the slaves the order of henchmen they must be made

comfortable they must cultivate pity for one another
23
the giver the creator the teacherthese are preludes of the ruler
24
all virtue and all selfmastery has only one purpose that of preparing

for the rule
25
every sacrifice that the ruler makes is rewarded a hundredfold
26
how much does not the warrior the prince thepg 265 man who is responsible

for himself sacrificethis should be highly honoured
27
the terrible task of the ruler who educates himselfthe kind of man

and people over which he will rule must be forecast in him it is in

himself therefore that he must first have become a ruler
28
the great educator like nature must elevate obstacles in order that

these may be overcome
29
the new teachers as preparatory stages for the highest architect they

must impose their type on things
30
institutions may be regarded as the after effects of great individuals

and the means of giving great individuals root and soiluntil the

fruit ultimately appears
31
as a matter of fact mankind is continually trying to be able to

dispense with great individuals by means of corporations c but they

are utterly dependent upon such great individuals for their ideal
32
the eudmonistic and social ideals lead men backwardsit may be that

they aim at a very useful working classthey are creating the ideal

slavepg 266 of the future the lower caste which must on no account be

lacking
33
equal rights for allthis is the most extraordinary form of

injustice for with it the highest men do not get their due
34
it is not a matter of the rights of the stronger for strong and weak

are alike in this that they all extend their power as far as they can
35
a new form of estimating man above all the question
how much power has he got
how manifold are his instincts
how great is his capacity for communication and assimilation
the ruler as the highest type
36
zarathustra rejoices that the war of the classes is at last over

and that now at length the time is ripe for an order of rank among

individuals his hatred of the democratic system of levelling is only

a blind as a matter of fact he is very pleased that this has gone so

far now he can perform his task
hitherto his doctrines had been directed only at the ruling caste of

the future these lords of the earth must now take the place of god

and must create for themselves the profound and absolute confidence

of those they rule their new holiness theirpg 267 renunciation of

happiness and ease must be their first principle to the lowest they

grant the heirloom of happiness not to themselves they deliver the

physiologically botched by teaching them the doctrine of swift death

they offer religions and philosophical systems to each according to his

rank
37
the conflict in the heart of the ruler is the contest between the love

which is in his heart for him who is most remote and the love which he

feels for his neighbour
to be a creator and to be capable of goodness are not at all things

which exclude one another they are rather one and the same thing but

the creator is farsighted and the good man nearsighted
38
the feeling of power the strife of all egos to discover that thought

which will remain poised above men like a starthe ego is a primum

mobile
39
the struggle for the application of the power which mankind now

represents zarathustra calls to the gladiators of this struggle
40
we must make our ideals prevailwe must strive for power in such a

way as our ideal commands
41
the doctrine of the eternal recurrence is the turning point of history
pg 268
42
suddenly the terrible chamber of truth is opened an unconscious

selfprotectiveness caution ambush defence keeps us from the gravest

knowledge thus have i lived heretofore i suppress something but the

restless babbling and rolling down of stones has rendered my instinct

overpowerful now i am rolling my last stone the most appalling truth

stands close to my hand
truth has been exorcised out of its gravewe created it we waked it

the highest expression of courage and of the feeling of power scorn of

all pessimism that has existed hitherto
we fight with itwe find out that our only means of enduring it is

to create a creature who is able to endure itunless of course we

voluntarily dazzle ourselves afresh and blind ourselves in regard to it

but this we are no longer able to do
we it was who created the gravest thoughtlet us now create a being

unto whom it will be not only light but blessed
in order to be able to create we must allow ourselves greater freedom

than has ever been vouchsafed us before to this end we must be

emancipated from morality and we must be relieved by means of feasts

premonitions of the future we must celebrate the future and no longer

the past we must compose the myth poetry of the future we must live

in hopes blessed moments i and then we must once again pull down the

curtain and turn our thoughts to the next unswerving purpose
pg 269
43
mankind must set its goal above itselfnot in a false world however

but in one which would be a continuation of humanity
44
the halfway house is always present when the will to the future

arises the greatest event stands immediately before it
45
our very essence is to create a being higher than ourselves we must

create beyond ourselves that is the instinct of procreation that is

the instinct of action and of workjust as all willing presupposes a

purpose so does mankind presuppose a creature which is not yet formed

but which provides the aim of life this is the freedom of all will

love reverence yearning for perfection longing all these things are

inherent in a purpose
46
my desire to bring forth creatures which stand sublimely above the

whole species man and to sacrifice ones neighbours and oneself to

this end
the morality which has existed hitherto was limited within the confines

of the species all moralities that have existed hitherto have been

useful in the first place in order to give unconditional stability to

this species once this has been achieved the aim can be elevated
one movement is absolute it is nothing more than the levelling down of

mankind great antorganisations c
pg 270
the other movement my movement is conversely the accentuation of all

contrasts and gulfs and the elimination of equality together with the

creation of supremely powerful creatures
the first movement brings forth the last man my movement brings forth

the superman it is by no means the goal to regard the latter as the

master of the first two races ought to exist side by sideseparated

as far asunder as possible the one like the epicurean gods not

concerning themselves in the least with the others
47
the opposite of the superman is the last man i created him

simultaneously with the former
48
the more an individual is free and firm the more exacting becomes his

love at last he yearns for superman because nothing else is able to

appease his love
49
halfway round the course superman arises
50
among men i was frightened among men i desired a host of things and

nothing satisfied me it was then that i went into solitude and created

superman and when i had created him i draped him in the great veil of

becoming and let the light of midday shine upon him
pg 271
51
we wish to create a being we all wish to have a hand in it to love

it we all want to be pregnantand to honour and respect ourselves on

that account
we must have a goal in view of which we may all love each other all

other goals are only fit for the scrap heap
52
the strongest in body and soul are the bestzarathustras fundamental

proposition from them is generated that higher morality of the

creator man must be regenerated after his own image this is what he

wants this is his honesty
53
genius to zarathustra seems like the incarnation of his thought
54
loneliness for a certain time is necessary in order that a creature

may become completely permeated with his own soulcured and hard a

new form of community would be one in which we should assert ourselves

martially otherwise the spirit becomes tame no epicurean gardens

and mere retirement from the masses war but without powder between

different thoughts and the hosts who support them i
a new nobility the result of breeding feasts celebrating the

foundation of families
the day divided up afresh bodily exercise for all ages 

as a principle
pg 272
the love of the sexes as a contest around the principle in becoming and

comingruling will be taught and practised its hardness as well as

its mildness as soon as one faculty is acquired in a masterly manner

another one must be striven after
we must let ourselves be taught by the evil and allow them an

opportunity of a contest we must make use of the degeneratethe right

of punishment will consist in this that the offender may be used as

an experimental subject in dietetics this is the consecration of

punishment that one man be used for the highest needs of a future

being
we protect our new community because it is the bridge to our ideal of

the future and for it we work and let others work
55
the measure and mean must be found in striving to attain to something

beyond mankind the highest and strongest kind of man must be

discovered the highest tendency must be represented continually

in small thingsperfection maturity rosycheeked health mild

discharges of power just as an artist works must we apply ourselves

to our daily task and bring ourselves to perfection in everything we

do we must be honest in acknowledging our real motives to ourselves

as is becoming in the mighty man
56
no impatience superman is our next stage and to this end to this

limit moderation and manliness are necessary
pg 273
mankind must surpass itself as the greeks didand no fleshless

fantasies must be indulged the higher mind which is associated with a

sickly and nervous character must be suppressed the goal the higher

culture of the whole body and not only of the brain
57
man is something that must be surpassedit is a matter of tempo

the greeks were wonderful there was no haste about themmy

predecessors heraclitus empedocles spinoza goethe
58
1 dissatisfaction with ourselves an antidote to repentance

the transformation of temperament eg by means of inorganic

substances good will to this dissatisfaction we should wait for our

thirst and let it become great in order to discover its source
2 death must be transformed into a means of victory and triumph
3 the attitude towards disease freedom where death is concerned
4 the love of the sexes is a means to an ideal it is the striving of

a being to perish through his opposite the love for a suffering deity
5 procreation is the holiest of all things pregnancy the creation of

a woman and a man who wish to enjoy their unity and erect a monument

to it by means of a child
6 pity as a danger circumstances must be created which enable

everyone to be able to helppg 274 himself and which leave him to choose

whether he would be helped
7 education must be directed at making men evil at developing their

inner devil
8 inner war as development
9 the maintenance of the species and the thought of eternal

recurrence
59
principal doctrine we must strive to make every stage one of

perfection and rejoice thereinwe must make no leaps
in the first place the promulgation of laws after the superman the

doctrine of eternal recurrence will strike us with horror now it is

endurable
60
life itself created this thought which is the most oppressive for life

life wishes to get beyond its greatest obstacle i
we must desire to perish in order to arise afreshfrom one day to

the other wander through a hundred soulslet that be thy life and

thy fate and then finally desire to go through the whole process once

more
61
the highest thing of all would be for us to be able to endure our

immortality
62
the moment in which i begot recurrence is immortal for the sake of

that moment alone i will endure recurrence
pg 275
63
the teaching of eternal recurrenceit is at first oppressive to the

more noble souls and apparently a means of weeding them outthen the

inferior and less sensitive natures would remain over this doctrine

must be suppressed and zarathustra killed
64
the hesitation of the disciples we are already able to bear with this

doctrine but we should destroy the many by means of it
zarathustra laughs ye shall be the hammer i laid this hammer in your

hands
65
i do not speak to you as i speak to the people the highest thing for

them would be to despise and to annihilate themselves the next highest

thing would be for them to despise and annihilate each other
66
my will to do good compels me to remain silent but my will to the

superman bids me speak and sacrifice even my friends
i would fain form and transform you how could i endure things

otherwise
67
the history of higher man the rearing of the better man is

incalculably more painful the ideal of the necessary sacrifice which

it involves as in the case of zarathustra should be demonstrated a

man should leave his home his family and his nativepg 276 land live under

the scorn of the prevailing morality the anguish of experiments and

errors the solution of all the joys offered by the older ideals they

are now felt to be partly hostile and partly strange
68
what is it which gives a meaning a value an importance to things

it is the creative heart which yearns and which created out of this

yearning it created joy and woe it wanted to sate itself also with

woe every kind of pain that man or beast has suffered we must take

upon ourselves and bless and have a goal whereby such suffering would

acquire some meaning
69
principal doctrine the transfiguration of pain into a blessing and of

poison into food lies in our power the will to suffering
70
concerning heroic greatness as the only state of pioneers a yearning

for utter ruin as a means of enduring ones existence
we must not desire one state only we must rather desire to be

periodical creatureslike existence
absolute indifference to other peoples opinions because we know their

weights and measures but their opinions of themselves should be the

subject of pity
71
disciples must unite three qualities in themselves they must be

true they must be able and willing topg 277 be communicative they must

have profound insight into each other
72
all kinds of higher men and their oppression and blighting as a case

in point duhring who was ruined by isolationon the whole this

is the fate of higher men today they seem to be a species that is

condemned to die out this fact seems to come to zarathustras ears

like a great cry for help all kinds of insane degenerations of higher

natures seem to approach him nihilism for instance
73
higher men who come to zarathustra in despair
temptations to return prematurely to the worldthanks to the

provocation of ones sympathies
1 the rolling stone the homeless one the wandererhe who has

unlearned the love of his people because he has learned to love many

peoplesthe good european
2 the gloomy ambitious son of the people shy lonely and ready for

anythingwho chooses rather to be alone than to be a destroyerhe

offers himself as an instrument
3 the ugliest man who is obliged to adorn himself historical sense

and who is always in search of a new garment he desires to make his

appearance becoming and finally retires into solitude in order not to

be seen he is ashamed of himself
4 he who honours facts the brain of a leech the most subtle

intellectual conscience and because he has it in excess a guilty

consciencehe wants to get rid of himself
pg 278
5 the poet who at bottom thirsts for savage freedomhe chooses

loneliness and the severity of knowledge
6 the discoverer of new intoxicantsthe musician the sorcerer who

finally drops on his knees before a loving heart and says not to me

do i wish to lead you but yonder to him
those who are sober to excess and who have a yearning for intoxication

which they do not gratify the supersobersides
7 genius as an attack of insanity becoming frozen through lack of

love i am neither a genius nor a god great tenderness people must

show him more love
8 the rich man who has given everything away and who asks everybody

have you anything you do not want give me some of it as a beggar
9 the kings who renounce dominion we seek him who is more worthy

to ruleagainst equality the great man is lacking consequently

reverence is lacking too
10 the actor of happiness
11 the pessimistic soothsayer who detects fatigue everywhere
12 the fool of the big city
13 the youth from the mount
14 the woman seeks the man
15 the envious emaciated toiler and arriviste
16 the good                      and their mad fancy
17 the pious                    for god that
18 the selfcentred and     means for me

           and saints
pg 279
74
i gave you the most weighty thought maybe mankind will perish through

it perhaps also mankind will be elevated through it inasmuch as by

its means the elements which are hostile to life will be overcome and

eliminated ye must not chide life but yourselvesthe destiny

of higher man is to be a creator the organisation of higher men the

education of the future ruler ye must rejoice in your superior power

when ye rule and when ye form anew not only man but superman will

recur eternally
75
the typical suffering of the reformer and also his consolations the

seven solitudes
he lives as though he were beyond all ages his loftiness allows him to

have intercourse with the anchorites and the misunderstood of every age
only his beauty is his defence he lays his hands on the next thousand

years
his love increases as he sees the impossibility of avoiding the

affliction of pain with it
76
zarathustras mood is not one of mad impatience for superman it is

peaceful it can wait but all action has derived some purpose from

being the road and means thitherand must be done well and perfectly
the repose of the great stream consecration of the smallest thing

all unrest and violent longing all loathing should be presented in

the third partpg 280 and be overcome the gentleness and mildness c in

the first and second parts are both signs of a power which is not yet

selfreliant
with the recovery of zarathustra csar stands there inexorable

and kindthe gulf separating creation goodness and wisdom is

annihilated
clearness peace no exaggerated craving happiness in the moment which

is properly occupied and immortalised
77
zarathustra part iii i myself am happywhen he had taken leave

of mankind he returned unto himself like a cloud it vanishes from him

the manner in which superman must live like an epicurean god
divine suffering is the substance of the third part of zarathustra the

human state of the legislator is only brought forward as an example
his intense love for his friends seems to him a diseaseonce more he

becomes peaceful
when the invitations come he gently evades them
78
in the fourth part it is necessary to say precisely why it is that the

time of the great noon has come it is really a description of the age

given by means of visits but interpreted by zarathustra
in the fourth part it is necessary to say precisely why a chosen

people has first to be createdthey are the lucky cases of nature

as opposed to the unlucky exemplified by the visitors only to them

the lucky casesis zarathustra able to express himself concerning

ultimate problems them alonepg 281 is he able to inspire with activity on

behalf of this theory they are strong healthy hard and above all

noble enough for him to give them the hammer with which to remould the

whole world
79
the unity in power of the creator the lover and the knight of

knowledge
80
love alone shall judgethe creative love which forgets itself in its

work
81
zarathustra can only dispense happiness once the order of rank is

established therefore this doctrine must be taught first
the order of rank develops into a system of earthly dominion the lords

of the earth come last a new ruling caste here and there there arises

from them a perfectly epicurean god a superman a transfigurer of

existence
the superhumans notion of the world dionysus returning from these

most strange of all pursuits zarathustra comes back with love to the

narrowest and smallest thingshe blesses all his experiences and dies

with a blessing on his lips
82
from people who merely pray we must become people who bless
