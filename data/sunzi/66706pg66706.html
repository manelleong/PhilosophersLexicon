</div>
<p>The seventh volume of <span lang="fr">“Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences,
les arts, les mœurs, les usages, &amp;c., des Chinois”</span><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote1" id="FNanchor1">[1]</a> is devoted to the
Art of War, and contains, amongst other treatises, <span lang="fr">“Les Treize Articles
de Sun-tse,”</span> translated from the Chinese by a Jesuit Father, Joseph
Amiot. Père Amiot appears to have enjoyed no small reputation as a
sinologue in his day, and the field of his labours was certainly
extensive. But his so-called translation of Sun Tzŭ, if placed side
by side with the original, is seen at once to be little better than an
imposture. It contains a great deal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and
very little indeed of what he did. Here is a fair specimen, taken from
the opening sentences of chapter 5:—</p>
<p class="smaller" lang="fr"><i>De l’habileté dans le gouvernement des Troupes.</i> Sun-tse dit:
Ayez les noms de tous les Officiers tant généraux que subalternes;
inscrivez-les dans un catalogue à part, avec la note des talents &amp;
de la capacité de chacun d’eux, afin de pouvoir les employer avec
avantage lorsque l’occasion en sera venue. Faites en sorte que
tous ceux que vous devez commander soient persuadés que votre
principale attention est de les préserver de tout dommage. Les
troupes que vous ferez avancer contre l’ennemi doivent être comme
des pierres que vous lanceriez contre des œufs. De vous à l’ennemi
il ne doit y avoir d’autre différence que celle du fort au foible,
du vuide au plein. Attaquez à découvert, mais soyez vainqueur en
secret. Voilà en peu de mots en quoi consiste l’habileté &amp; toute
la perfection même du gouvernement des troupes.</p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth century, which saw a wonderful development
in the study of Chinese literature, no translator ventured to tackle
Sun Tzŭ, although his work was known to be highly valued in China as
by far the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_VIII">{VIII}</span> oldest and best compendium of military science. It
was not until the year 1905 that the first English translation by
Capt. E. F. Calthrop, R.F.A., appeared at Tokyo under the title
“Sonshi” (the Japanese form of Sun Tzŭ)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote2" id="FNanchor2">[2]</a>. Unfortunately, it was evident
that the translator’s knowledge of Chinese was far too scanty to fit
him to grapple with the manifold difficulties of Sun Tzŭ. He himself
plainly acknowledges that without the aid of two Japanese gentlemen
“the accompanying translation would have been impossible.” We can only
wonder, then, that with their help it should have been so excessively
bad. It is not merely a question of downright blunders, from which
none can hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard
passages were wilfully distorted or slurred over. Such offences are
less pardonable. They would not be tolerated in any edition of a Greek
or Latin classic, and a similar standard of honesty ought to be
insisted upon in translations from Chinese.</p>
<p>From blemishes of this nature, at least, I believe that the present
translation is free. It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate
of my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a
better fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I
could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors. Towards
the end of 1908, a new and revised edition of Capt. Calthrop’s
translation was published in London, this time, however, without any
allusion to his Japanese collaborators. My first three chapters were
then already in the printer’s hands, so that the criticisms of Capt.
Calthrop therein contained must be understood as referring to
his earlier edition. In the subsequent chapters I have of course
transferred my attention to the second edition. This is on the whole an
improvement on the other, though there still remains much that cannot
pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_IX">{IX}</span> muster. Some of the grosser blunders have been rectified and
lacunae filled up, but on the other hand a certain number of new
mistakes appear. The very first sentence of the introduction is
startlingly inaccurate; and later on, while mention is made of “an army
of Japanese commentators” on Sun Tzŭ (who are these, by the way?), not
a word is vouchsafed about the Chinese commentators, who nevertheless,
I venture to assert, form a much more numerous and infinitely more
important “army.”</p>
<p>A few special features of the present volume may now be noticed. In
the first place, the text has been cut up into numbered paragraphs,
both in order to facilitate cross-reference and for the convenience of
students generally. The division follows broadly that of Sun
Hsing-yen’s edition; but I have sometimes found it desirable to join
two or more of his paragraphs into one. In quoting from other works,
Chinese writers seldom give more than the bare title by way of
reference, and the task of research is apt to be seriously hampered in
consequence. With a view to obviating this difficulty so far as Sun
Tzŭ is concerned, I have also appended a complete concordance of
Chinese characters, following in this the admirable example of Legge,
though an alphabetical arrangement has been preferred to the
distribution under radicals which he adopted. Another feature borrowed
from “The Chinese Classics” is the printing of text, translation and
notes on the same page; the notes, however, are inserted, according to
the Chinese method, immediately after the passages to which they
refer. From the mass of native commentary my aim has been to extract
the cream only, adding the Chinese text here and there when it seemed
to present points of literary interest. Though constituting in itself
an important branch of Chinese literature, very little commentary of
this kind has hitherto been made directly accessible by translation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote3" id="FNanchor3">[3]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_X">X</p>
<p>I may say in conclusion that, owing to the printing off of my
sheets as they were completed, the work has not had the benefit of a
final revision. On a review of the whole, without modifying the
substance of my criticisms, I might have been inclined in a few
instances to temper their asperity. Having chosen to wield a bludgeon,
however, I shall not cry out if in return I am visited with more than
a rap over the knuckles. Indeed, I have been at some pains to put a
sword into the hands of future opponents by scrupulously giving either
text or reference for every passage translated. A scathing review,
even from the pen of the Shanghai critic who despises “mere
translations,” would not, I must confess, be altogether unwelcome.
For, after all, the worst fate I shall have to dread is that which
befell the ingenious paradoxes of George in <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="smcap" id="SunWuAndHisBook">Sun Wu and his Book</h3>
<p>Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzŭ:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote4" id="FNanchor4">[4]</a>—</p>
<div class="smaller">
<p><span lang="zh">孫子武</span> Sun Tzŭ Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State. His <cite>Art of War</cite>
brought him to the notice of <span lang="zh">闔廬</span> Ho Lu,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote5" id="FNanchor5">[5]</a> King of <span lang="zh">吳</span> Wu. Ho Lu said
to him: I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I submit your
theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ replied: You may.</p>
<p>Ho Lu asked: May the test be applied to women?</p>
<p>The answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made
to bring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzŭ divided them into
two companies, and placed one of the King’s favourite concubines
at the head of each. He then bade them all take spears in their
hands, and addressed them thus: I presume you know the difference
between front and back, right hand and left hand?</p>
<p>The girls replied: Yes.</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ went on: When I say “Eyes front,” you must look straight
ahead. When I say “Left turn,” you must face towards your left
hand. When I say “Right turn,” you must face towards your right
hand. When I say “About turn,” you must face right round towards
the back.</p>
<p>Again the girls assented. The words of command having been thus
explained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to
begin the drill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order
“Right turn.” But the girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tzŭ said:
If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not
thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame.</p>
<p>So he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order
“Left turn,” whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of
laughter. Sun Tzŭ said: If words of command are not clear and
distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is
to blame. But if his orders <em>are</em> clear, and the soldiers
nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.</p>
<p>So saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be
beheaded. Now the King of Wu was watching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XII">{XII}</span> scene from the top
of a raised pavilion; and when he saw that his favourite
concubines were about to be executed, he was greatly alarmed and
hurriedly sent down the following message: We are now quite
satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle troops. If We are
bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will lose their
savour. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ replied: Having once received His Majesty’s commission to
be general of his forces, there are certain commands of His
Majesty which, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway
installed the pair next in order as leaders in their place. When
this had been done, the drum was sounded for the drill once more;
and the girls went through all the evolutions, turning to the
right or to the left, marching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or
standing, with perfect accuracy and precision, not venturing to
utter a sound. Then Sun Tzŭ sent a messenger to the King saying:
Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and
ready for Your Majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use
that their sovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and
water, and they will not disobey.</p>
<p>But the King replied: Let our general cease drilling and return to
camp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the
troops.</p>
<p>Thereupon Sun Tzŭ said: The King is only fond of words, and cannot
translate them into deeds.</p>
<p>After that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzŭ was one who knew how to handle
an army, and finally appointed him general. In the West, he
defeated the Ch‘u State and forced his way into Ying, the capital;
to the north, he put fear into the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and
spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tzŭ
shared in the might of the King.</p>
</div>
<p>About Sun Tzŭ himself this is all that Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in
this chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant,
<span lang="zh">孫臏</span> Sun Pin, born about a hundred years after his famous ancestor’s
death, and also the outstanding military genius of his time. The
historian speaks of him too as Sun Tzŭ, and in his preface we read:
<span lang="zh">孫子臏脚而論兵法</span> “Sun Tzŭ had his feet cut off and yet continued to
discuss the art of war.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote6" id="FNanchor6">[6]</a> It seems likely, then, that “Pin” was a
nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation, unless indeed the story
was invented in order to account for the name. The crowning incident
of his career, the crushing defeat of his treacherous rival P‘ang
Chüan, will be found briefly related on p. <a href="#Page_40" class="pginternal">40</a>.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_XIII">{XIII}</p>
<p>To return to the elder Sun Tzŭ. He is mentioned in two other passages
of the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>:—</p>
<p class="smaller">In the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, King of Wu, took
the field with <span lang="zh">子胥</span> Tzŭ-hsü [i.e. <span lang="zh">伍員</span> Wu Yüan] and <span lang="zh">伯嚭</span> Po P‘ei,
and attacked Ch‘u. He captured the town of <span lang="zh">舒</span> Shu and slew the two
prince’s sons who had formerly been generals of Wu. He was then
meditating a descent on <span lang="zh">郢</span> Ying [the capital]; but the general Sun
Wu said: “The army is exhausted.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote7" id="FNanchor7">[7]</a> It is not yet possible. We
must wait”....<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote8" id="FNanchor8">[8]</a> [After further successful fighting,] in the
ninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu of Wu addressed Wu Tzŭ-hsü and
Sun Wu, saying: “Formerly, you declared that it was not yet
possible for us to enter Ying. Is the time ripe now?” The two men
replied: “Ch‘u’s general, <span lang="zh">子常</span> Tzŭ-ch‘ang,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote9" id="FNanchor9">[9]</a> is grasping and
covetous, and the princes of <span lang="zh">唐</span> T‘ang and <span lang="zh">蔡</span> Ts‘ai both have a
grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand
attack, you must win over T‘ang and Ts‘ai, and then you may
succeed.” Ho Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch‘u in five pitched
battles and marched into Ying].<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote10" id="FNanchor10">[10]</a></p>
<p>This is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He
does not appear to have survived his patron, who died from the effects
of a wound in 496.</p>
<p>In the chapter entitled <span lang="zh">律書</span> (the earlier portion of which M. Chavannes
believes to be a fragment of a treatise on Military Weapons), there
occurs this passage:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote11" id="FNanchor11">[11]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">From this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after
the other: <span lang="zh">咎犯</span> Kao-fan,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote12" id="FNanchor12">[12]</a> who was employed by the Chin State;
Wang-tzŭ,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote13" id="FNanchor13">[13]</a> in the service of Ch‘i; and Sun Wu, in the service of
Wu. These men developed and threw light upon the principles of war
(<span lang="zh">申明軍約</span>).</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_XIV">{XIV}</p>
<p>It is obvious that Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the
reality of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and with one exception,
to be noticed presently, he is by far the most important authority on
the period in question. It will not be necessary, therefore, to say
much of such a work as the <span lang="zh">吳越春秋</span> <i>Wu Yüeh Ch‘un Ch‘iu</i>, which is
supposed to have been written by <span lang="zh">趙曄</span> Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D.
The attribution is somewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise,
his account would be of little value, based as it is on the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>
and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun Tzŭ will be
found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it
worth noting are: 1) Sun Tzŭ was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu
Tzŭ-hsü. 2) He is called a native of Wu.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote14" id="FNanchor14">[14]</a> 3) He had previously
lived a retired life, and his contemporaries were unaware of his
ability.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote15" id="FNanchor15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The following passage occurs in <span lang="zh">淮南子</span> Huai-nan Tzŭ: “When sovereign and
ministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzŭ
to encounter the foe.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote16" id="FNanchor16">[16]</a> Assuming that this work is genuine (and
hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we have here the earliest
direct reference to Sun Tzŭ, for Huai-nan Tzŭ died in 122 B.C., many
years before the <cite>Shih Chi</cite> was given to the world.</p>
<p><span lang="zh">劉向</span> Liu Hsiang (B.C. 80–9) in his <span lang="zh">新序</span> says: “The reason why Sun Wu at
the head of 30,000 men beat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XV">{XV}</span> Ch‘u with 200,000 is that the latter were
undisciplined.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote17" id="FNanchor17">[17]</a></p>
<p><span lang="zh">鄧名世</span> Têng Ming-shih in his <span lang="zh">姓氏辨證書</span> (completed in 1134) informs us
that the surname <span lang="zh">孫</span> was bestowed on Sun Wu’s grandfather by <span lang="zh">景公</span> Duke
Ching of Ch‘i [547–490 B.C.]. Sun Wu’s father Sun <span lang="zh">馮</span> P‘ing, rose to be
a Minister of State in Ch‘i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was <span lang="zh">長卿</span>
Ch‘ang-ch‘ing, fled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being
fomented by the kindred of <span lang="zh">田鮑</span> T‘ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom
the second, named <span lang="zh">明</span> Ming, was the father of Sun Pin. According to this
account, then, Pin was the grandson of Wu,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote18" id="FNanchor18">[18]</a> which, considering that
Sun Pin’s victory over <span lang="zh">魏</span> Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed
as chronologically impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Têng
Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance whatever can be
placed in them.</p>
<p>An interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han
period is the short preface written by the great <span lang="zh">曹操</span> Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or
<span lang="zh">魏武帝</span> Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun Tzŭ. I shall give it in full:—</p>
<div class="smaller">
<p>I have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their
advantage.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote19" id="FNanchor19">[19]</a> The <cite>Lun Yü</cite> says: “There must be a sufficiency of
military strength.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote20" id="FNanchor20">[20]</a> The <cite>Shu Ching</cite> mentions “the army” among
the “eight objects of government.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote21" id="FNanchor21">[21]</a> The <cite>I Ching</cite> says: “<span lang="zh">師</span>
‘army’ indicates firmness and justice; the experienced leader will
have good fortune.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote22" id="FNanchor22">[22]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_XVI">{XVI}</span> The <cite>Shih Ching</cite> says: “The King rose
majestic in his wrath, and he marshalled his troops.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote23" id="FNanchor23">[23]</a> The
Yellow Emperor, T‘ang the Completer and Wu Wang all used spears
and battle-axes in order to succour their generation. The <cite>Ssŭ-ma
Fa</cite> says: “If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself may
rightfully be slain.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote24" id="FNanchor24">[24]</a> He who relies solely on warlike measures
shall be exterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures
shall perish. Instances of this are Fu Ch‘ai<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote25" id="FNanchor25">[25]</a> on the one hand
and Yen Wang on the other.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote26" id="FNanchor26">[26]</a> In military matters, the Sage’s
rule is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only
when occasion requires. He will not use armed force unless driven
to it by necessity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote27" id="FNanchor27">[27]</a></p>
<p>Many books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the
work composed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all. [Sun Tzŭ
was a native of the Ch‘i state, his personal name was Wu. He wrote
the <cite>Art of War</cite> in 13 chapters for Ho Lü, King of Wu. Its
principles were tested on women, and he was subsequently made a
general. He led an army westwards, crushed the Ch‘u State and
entered Ying the capital. In the north, he kept Ch‘i and Chin in
awe. A hundred years and more after his time, Sun Pin lived. He
was a descendant of Wu].<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote28" id="FNanchor28">[28]</a> In his treatment of deliberation and
planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote29" id="FNanchor29">[29]</a>
clearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XVII">{XVII}</span> Tzŭ stands
beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however,
have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and
while putting into practice the smaller details in which his work
abounds, they have overlooked its essential purport. That is the
motive which has led me to outline a rough explanation of the
whole.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote30" id="FNanchor30">[30]</a></p>
</div>
<p>One thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that
the 13 chapters were specially composed for King Ho Lu. This is
supported by the internal evidence of I. § 15, in which it seems clear
that some ruler is addressed.</p>
<p>In the bibliographical section of the <cite>Han Shu</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote31" id="FNanchor31">[31]</a> there is an
entry which has given rise to much discussion: <span lang="zh">吳孫子八十二篇圖九卷</span> “The
works of Sun Tzŭ of Wu in 82 <i>p‘ien</i> (or chapters), with diagrams in 9
<i>chüan</i>.” It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters
known to Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien, or those we possess to-day. Chang Shou-chieh
in his <span lang="zh">史記正義</span> refers to an edition of Sun Tzŭ’s <span lang="zh">兵法</span> of which the “13
chapters” formed the first <i>chüan</i>, adding that there were two other
<i>chüan</i> besides.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote32" id="FNanchor32">[32]</a> This has brought forth a theory, that the bulk
of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzŭ—we should
call them apocryphal—similar to the <span lang="zh">問答</span> <cite>Wên Ta</cite>, of which a specimen
dealing with the Nine Situations<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote33" id="FNanchor33">[33]</a> is preserved in the <span lang="zh">通典</span> <cite>T‘ung
Tien</cite>, and another in Ho Shih’s commentary. It is suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XVIII">{XVIII}</span> that
before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzŭ had only written the 13
chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of
question and answer between himself and the King. <span lang="zh">畢以珣</span> Pi I-hsün,
author of the <span lang="zh">孫子敘錄</span> <i>Sun Tzŭ Hsü Lu</i>, backs this up with a quotation
from the <cite>Wu Yüeh Ch‘un Ch‘iu</cite>: “The King of Wu summoned Sun Tzŭ, and
asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he set forth a
chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise
him.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote34" id="FNanchor34">[34]</a> As he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the
same scale as in the above-mentioned fragments, the total number of
chapters could not fail to be considerable.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote35" id="FNanchor35">[35]</a> Then the numerous
other treatises attributed to Sun Tzŭ<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote36" id="FNanchor36">[36]</a> might also be included. The
fact that the <cite>Han Chih</cite> mentions no work of Sun Tzŭ except the 82
<i>p‘ien</i>, whereas the Sui and T‘ang bibliographies give the titles of
others in addition to the “13 chapters,” is good proof, Pi I-hsün
thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 <i>p‘ien</i>. Without
pinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the <cite>Wu Yüeh
Ch‘un Ch‘iu</cite>, or admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises
cited by Pi I-hsün, we may see in this theory a probable solution of
the mystery. Between Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of time
for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the magic
name of Sun Tzŭ, and the 82 <i>p‘ien</i> may very well represent a
collected edition of these lumped together with the original work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XIX">{XIX}</span> It
is also possible, though less likely, that some of them existed in the
time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote37" id="FNanchor37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Tu Mu, after Ts‘ao Kung the most important commentator on Sun Tzŭ,
composed the preface to his edition<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote38" id="FNanchor38">[38]</a> about the middle of the ninth
century. After a somewhat lengthy defence of the military art,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote39" id="FNanchor39">[39]</a> he
comes at last to Sun Tzŭ himself, and makes one or two very startling
assertions:—“The writings of Sun Wu,” he says, “originally comprised
several hundred thousand words, but Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, the Emperor Wu Wei,
pruned away all redundancies and wrote out the essence of the whole,
so as to form a single book in 13 chapters.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote40" id="FNanchor40">[40]</a> He goes on to remark
that Ts‘ao Ts‘ao’s commentary on Sun Tzŭ leaves a certain proportion
of difficulties unexplained. This, in Tu Mu’s opinion, does not
necessarily imply that he was unable to furnish a complete
commentary.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote41" id="FNanchor41">[41]</a> According to the <cite>Wei Chih</cite>, Ts‘ao himself wrote a
book on war in something over 100,000 words, known as the 新書. It
appears to have been of such exceptional merit that he suspects Ts‘ao
to have used for it the surplus material which he had found in Sun
Tzŭ. He concludes, however, by saying: “The <cite>Hsin Shu</cite> is now lost, so
that the truth cannot be known for certain.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote42" id="FNanchor42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Tu Mu’s conjecture seems to be based on a passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XX">{XX}</span> in the 漢官解詁 “Wei
Wu Ti strung together Sun Wu’s Art of War,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote43" id="FNanchor43">[43]</a> which in turn may have
resulted from a misunderstanding of the final words of Ts‘ao Kung’s
preface: <span lang="zh">故撰爲略解焉</span>. This, as Sun Hsing-yen points out,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote44" id="FNanchor44">[44]</a> is only a
modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote45" id="FNanchor45">[45]</a> or in
other words, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, the theory has
met with very little acceptance. Thus, the <span lang="zh">四庫全書</span> says:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote46" id="FNanchor46">[46]</a> “The
mention of the 13 chapters in the <cite>Shih Chi</cite> shows that they were in
existence before the <cite>Han Chih</cite>, and that later accretions are not to
be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu’s assertion can
certainly not be taken as proof.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote47" id="FNanchor47">[47]</a></p>
<p>There is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed
in the time of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now. That the
work was then well known he tells us in so many words: “Sun Tzŭ’s 13
Chapters and Wu Ch‘i’s Art of War are the two books that people
commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of then are
widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote48" id="FNanchor48">[48]</a> But as we go
further back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact
which has to be faced is that the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, the great contemporary
record, makes no mention whatever of Sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXI">{XXI}</span> Wu, either as a general or as
a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance, that
many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as
given in the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, but even show themselves frankly sceptical as
to the existence of the man at all. The most powerful presentment of
this side of the case is to be found in the following disquisition by
<span lang="zh">葉水心</span> Yeh Shui-hsin:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote49" id="FNanchor49">[49]</a>—</p>
<p class="smaller">It is stated in Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native
of the Ch‘i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho
Lü he crushed Ch‘u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in
Tso’s Commentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s
Commentary need not contain absolutely everything that other
histories contain. But Tso has not omitted to mention vulgar
plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K‘ao-shu,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote50" id="FNanchor50">[50]</a> Ts‘ao
Kuei,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote51" id="FNanchor51">[51]</a> Chu Chih-wu<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote52" id="FNanchor52">[52]</a> and Chuan Shê-chu.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote53" id="FNanchor53">[53]</a> In the case of
Sun Wu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the
omission is much more glaring. Again, details are given, in their
due order, about his contemporaries Wu Yüan and the Minister
P‘ei.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote54" id="FNanchor54">[54]</a> Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been passed
over?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote55" id="FNanchor55">[55]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">In point of literary style, Sun Tzŭ’s work belongs to the same
school as <cite>Kuan Tzŭ</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote56" id="FNanchor56">[56]</a> the <cite>Liu T‘ao</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote57" id="FNanchor57">[57]</a> and the <cite>Yüeh Yü</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote58" id="FNanchor58">[58]</a>
and may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXII">{XXII}</span> been the production of some private scholar living
towards the end of the “Spring and Autumn” or the beginning of the
“Warring States” period.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote59" id="FNanchor59">[59]</a> The story that his precepts were
actually applied by the Wu State, is merely the outcome of big
talk on the part of his followers.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote60" id="FNanchor60">[60]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">From the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote61" id="FNanchor61">[61]</a> down to the
time of the “Spring and Autumn,” all military commanders were
statesmen as well, and the class of professional generals, for
conducting external campaigns, did not then exist. It was not
until the period of the “Six States”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote62" id="FNanchor62">[62]</a> that this custom changed.
Now although Wu was an uncivilised State, is it conceivable that
Tso should have left unrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great
general and yet held no civil office? What we are told, therefore,
about Jang-chü<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote63" id="FNanchor63">[63]</a> and Sun Wu, is not authentic matter, but the
reckless fabrication of theorising pundits. The story of Ho Lü’s
experiment on the women, in particular, is utterly preposterous
and incredible.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote64" id="FNanchor64">[64]</a></p>
<p>Yeh Shui-hsin represents Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien as having said that Sun Wu
crushed Ch‘u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the
impression left on the reader’s mind is that he at least shared in
these exploits; but the actual subject of the verbs <span lang="zh">破</span>, <span lang="zh">入</span>, <span lang="zh">威</span> and <span lang="zh">顯</span>
is certainly <span lang="zh">闔廬</span>, as is shown by the next words: <span lang="zh">孫子與有力焉</span>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote65" id="FNanchor65">[65]</a>
The fact may or may not be significant; but it is nowhere explicitly
stated in the <cite>Shih Chi</cite> either that Sun Tzŭ was general on the
occasion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXIII">{XXIII}</span> the taking of Ying, or that he even went there at all.
Moreover, as we know that Wu Yüan and Po P‘ei both took part in the
expedition, and also that its success was largely due to the dash and
enterprise of <span lang="zh">夫槩</span> Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother, it is not easy to
see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part in
the same campaign.</p>
<p><span lang="zh">陳振孫</span> Ch‘ên Chên-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote66" id="FNanchor66">[66]</a>—</p>
<p class="smaller">Military writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But
the fact that he does not appear in the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, although he
is said to have served under Ho Lü King of Wu, makes it uncertain
what period he really belonged to.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote67" id="FNanchor67">[67]</a></p>
<p class="noindent">He also says:—</p>
<p class="smaller">The works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch‘i may be of genuine antiquity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote68" id="FNanchor68">[68]</a></p>
<p>It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch‘ên Chên-sun, while
rejecting the personality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien’s
history, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to
the work which passes under his name. The author of the <cite>Hsü Lu</cite> fails
to appreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack
on Ch‘ên Chên-sun really misses its mark. He makes one or two points,
however, which certainly tell in favour of the high antiquity of
our “13 chapters.” “Sun Tzŭ,” he says, “must have lived in the age
of Ching Wang [519–476], because he is frequently plagiarised in
subsequent works of the Chou, Ch‘in and Han dynasties.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote69" id="FNanchor69">[69]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXIV">{XXIV}</span> The two
most shameless offenders in this respect are Wu Ch‘i and Huai-nan Tzŭ,
both of them important historical personages in their day. The former
lived only a century after the alleged date of Sun Tzŭ, and his death
is known to have taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to
Liu Hsiang, that <span lang="zh">曾申</span> Tsêng Shên delivered the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, which had
been entrusted to him by its author.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote70" id="FNanchor70">[70]</a> Now the fact that quotations
from the <cite>Art of War</cite>, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found
in so many authors of different epochs, establishes a very strong
probability that there was some common source anterior to them all,—in
other words, that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was already in existence towards
the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> century B.C. Further proof of Sun Tzŭ’s antiquity
is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to
a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps
be extended, is given in the <cite>Hsü Lu</cite>; and though some of the
interpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected
thereby.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote71" id="FNanchor71">[71]</a> Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui-hsin, a
scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the
style of the 13 chapters to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXV">{XXV}</span> belong to the early part of the fifth
century. Seeing that he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove
the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be sure that he would not
have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly
believed the contrary. And it is precisely on such a point that
the judgment of an educated Chinaman will carry most weight. Other
internal evidence is not far to seek. Thus, in XIII. § 1, there is an
unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which had
already passed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it
revived in a modified form.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote72" id="FNanchor72">[72]</a> The only warfare Sun Tzŭ knows is that
carried on between the various feudal princes (<span lang="zh">諸侯</span>), in which armoured
chariots play a large part. Their use seems to have entirely died out
before the end of the Chou dynasty. He speaks as a man of Wu, a state
which ceased to exist as early as 473 B.C. On this I shall touch
presently.</p>
<p>But once refer the work to the 5<sup>th</sup> century or earlier, and the
chances of its being other than a <i>bonâ fide</i> production are sensibly
diminished. The great age of forgeries did not come until long after.
That it should have been forged in the period immediately following
473 is particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to
identify himself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory,
that the author was a literary recluse,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote73" id="FNanchor73">[73]</a> that seems to me quite
untenable. If one thing is more apparent than another after reading
the maxims of Sun Tzŭ, it is that their essence has been distilled
from a large store of personal observation and experience. They
reflect the mind not only of a born strategist, gifted with a rare
faculty of generalisation, but also of a practical soldier closely
acquainted with the military conditions of his time. To say nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXVI">{XXVI}</span>
of the fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all
the greatest captains of Chinese history, they offer a combination
of freshness and sincerity, acuteness and common sense, which quite
excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in the study.
If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine production of
a military man living towards the end of the “Ch‘un Ch‘iu” period, are
we not bound, in spite of the silence of the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, to accept
Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien’s account in its entirety? In view of his high repute as
a sober historian, must we not hesitate to assume that the records he
drew upon for Sun Wu’s biography were false and untrustworthy? The
answer, I fear, must be in the negative. There is still one grave, if
not fatal, objection to the chronology involved in the story as told
in the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, which, so far as I am aware, nobody has yet
pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzŭ in which he alludes
to contemporary affairs. The first is in VI. § 21:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our
own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of
victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.</p>
<p class="noindent">The other is in XI. § 30:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Asked if an army can be made to imitate the <i>shuai-jan</i>, I should
answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are enemies;
yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught
by a storm, they will come to each other’s assistance just as the
left hand helps the right.</p>
<p>These two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of
composition. They assign the work to the period of the struggle
between Wu and Yüeh. So much has been observed by Pi I-hsün. But what
has hitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the
credibility of Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien’s narrative. As we have seen above, the
first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is
then spoken of as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu,
so that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken
place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXVII">{XXVII}</span> and of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier
still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the
capture of Ying in 506, <span lang="zh">楚</span> Ch‘u, and not Yüeh, was the great hereditary
enemy of Wu. The two states, Ch‘u and Wu, had been constantly at war
for over half a century,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote74" id="FNanchor74">[74]</a> whereas the first war between Wu and Yüeh
was waged only in 510,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote75" id="FNanchor75">[75]</a> and even then was no more than a short
interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch‘u.
Now Ch‘u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural
inference is that they were written at a time when Yüeh had become the
prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch‘u had suffered the great
humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found useful.</p>

<p>The sentence quoted above from VI. § 21 hardly strikes me as one that
could have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather
to imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against
Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may
conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which
date Yüeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against
Wu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it
must have been during the period 505–496, when there was a lull in
the hostilities, Wu having presumably been exhausted by its supreme
effort against Ch‘u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the
tradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well
have seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period
482–473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote76" id="FNanchor76">[76]</a>
We may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been,
was not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point
the negative testimony of the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite> far outweighs any shred of
authority still attaching to the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, if once its other facts
are discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to
explain the omission of his name from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXIX">{XXIX}</span> the great commentary. It was Wu
Tzŭ-hsü, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s exploits, because
the latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the
State.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote77" id="FNanchor77">[77]</a></p>
<p>How then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing
celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown
to its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so
well versed in the science of war should have solid achievements
to his credit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the
greatest feat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting
impression on all the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the
short-lived zenith of her power. Hence, what more natural, as time
went on, than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should
be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in
the sense that his brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it
was actually carried out by him in conjunction with Wu Yüan,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote78" id="FNanchor78">[78]</a> Po
P‘ei and Fu Kai?</p>
<p>It is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun
Tzŭ’s life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this
necessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service
of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered experience,
though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the
intense military activity which marked the first half of that prince’s
reign.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote79" id="FNanchor79">[79]</a> If he rose to be a general at all, he certainly was never
on an equal footing with the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXX">{XXX}</span> above mentioned. He was doubtless
present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s
sudden collapse in the following year. Yüeh’s attack at this critical
juncture, when her rival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have
convinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against
whom every effort would henceforth have to be directed. Sun Wu was
thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous
book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the
end, rather than the beginning, of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the
women may possibly have grown out of some real incident occurring
about the same time. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any
source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to have
taken part in the death-struggle with Yüeh, which began with the
disaster at Tsui-li.</p>
<p>If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain
irony in the fate which decreed that China’s most illustrious man
of peace should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war.</p>
<h3 class="smcap" id="TheTextOfSunTzu">The Text of Sun Tzŭ.</h3>
<p>I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzŭ’s
text. The quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the
“13 chapters” of which Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien speaks were essentially the same
as those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely
circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from
discussing them on that account.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote80" id="FNanchor80">[80]</a> Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:—</p>
<p class="smaller">During the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzŭ’s <cite>Art of War</cite> was in
general use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have
treated it as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to
expound it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXI">{XXXI}</span> the benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that
Wei Wu was the first to write a commentary on it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote81" id="FNanchor81">[81]</a></p>
<p>As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that
Ts‘ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so
obscure, and the number of editions which appeared from that time
onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and Sung dynasties, that
it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to
creep in. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the
chief commentaries on Sun Tzŭ were in existence, a certain <span lang="zh">吉天保</span> Chi
T‘ien-pao published a work in 15 <i>chüan</i> entitled <span lang="zh">十家孫子會注</span> “Sun Tzŭ
with the collected commentaries of ten writers.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote82" id="FNanchor82">[82]</a> There was another
text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of <span lang="zh">大興</span> Ta-hsing,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote83" id="FNanchor83">[83]</a>
which also had supporters among the scholars of that period; but in
the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-yen tells us, these readings were for
some reason or other no longer put into circulation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote84" id="FNanchor84">[84]</a> Thus, until
the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the text in sole possession of the field
was one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy
of that important work was known to have survived. That, therefore,
is the text of Sun Tzŭ which appears in the War section of the great
Imperial encyclopaedia printed in 1726, the <span lang="zh">古今圖書集成</span> <cite>Ku Chin T‘u
Shu Chi Ch‘êng</cite>. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically
the same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the
<span lang="zh">周秦十一子</span> “Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch‘in dynasties”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXII">{XXXII}</span>
[1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s first edition
is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese
channels. So things remained until <span lang="zh">孫星衍</span> Sun Hsing-yen [1752–1818], a
distinguished antiquarian and classical scholar,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote85" id="FNanchor85">[85]</a> who claimed to be
an actual descendant of Sun Wu,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote86" id="FNanchor86">[86]</a> accidentally discovered a copy of
Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the
<span lang="zh">華陰</span> Hua-yin temple.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote87" id="FNanchor87">[87]</a> Appended to it was the <span lang="zh">遺說</span> <cite>I Shuo</cite> of <span lang="zh">鄭友賢</span>
Chêng Yu-hsien, mentioned in the <cite>T‘ung Chih</cite>, and also believed to
have perished.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote88" id="FNanchor88">[88]</a> This is what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the <span lang="zh">古本</span>
or <span lang="zh">原本</span> “original edition (or text)”—a rather misleading name, for it
cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzŭ in
its pristine purity. Chi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote89" id="FNanchor89">[89]</a> and
appears to have been content to reproduce the somewhat debased version
current in his day, without troubling to collate it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXIII">{XXXIII}</span> with the earliest
editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzŭ, even
older than the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried
in the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>, Tu Yu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the
other similarly enshrined in the <cite>T‘ai P‘ing Yü Lan</cite> encyclopaedia. In
both the complete text is to be found, though split up into fragments,
intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of
different sections. Considering that the <cite>Y‘ü Lan</cite> takes us back to
the year 983, and the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> about 200 years further still, to
the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the value of these early transcripts
of Sun Tzŭ can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of utilising them
does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting
under Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the
text. This is his own account:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Because of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzŭ which his
editors had handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient
edition [of Chi T‘ien-pao] should be used, and that the text
should be revised and corrected throughout. It happened that Wu
Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua, and Hsi, a graduate of the second
degree, had all devoted themselves to this study, probably
surpassing me therein. Accordingly, I have had the whole work cut
on blocks as a text-book for military men.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote90" id="FNanchor90">[90]</a></p>
<p>The three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on
the text of Sun Tzŭ prior to Sun Hsing-yen’s commission, but we are
left in doubt as to the work they really accomplished. At any rate,
the new edition, when ultimately produced, appeared in the names of
Sun Hsing-yen and only one co-editor, <span lang="zh">吳人驥</span> Wu Jên-chi. They took the
“original text” as their basis, and by careful comparison with the
older versions, as well as the extant commentaries and other sources
of information such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXIV">{XXXIV}</span> the <cite>I Shuo</cite>, succeeded in restoring a very
large number of doubtful passages, and turned out, on the whole, what
must be accepted as the closest approximation we are ever likely to
get to Sun Tzŭ’s original work. This is what will hereafter be
denominated the “standard text.”</p>
<p>The copy which I have used belongs to a re-issue dated 1877. It is in
6 <i>pên</i>, forming part of a well-printed set of 23 early philosophical
works in 83 <i>pên</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote91" id="FNanchor91">[91]</a> It opens with a preface by Sun Hsing-yen
(largely quoted in this introduction), vindicating the traditional
view of Sun Tzŭ’s life and performances, and summing up in remarkably
concise fashion the evidence in its favour. This is followed by Ts‘ao
Kung’s preface to his edition, and the biography of Sun Tzŭ from
the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, both translated above. Then come, firstly, Chêng
Yu-hsien’s <cite>I Shuo</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote92" id="FNanchor92">[92]</a> with author’s preface, and next, a short
miscellany of historical and bibliographical information entitled
<span lang="zh">孫子敘錄</span> <cite>Sun Tzŭ Hsü Lu</cite>, compiled by <span lang="zh">畢以珣</span> Pi I-hsün. As regards the
body of the work, each separate sentence is followed by a note on the
text, if required, and then by the various commentaries appertaining
to it, arranged in chronological order. These we shall now proceed to
discuss briefly, one by one.</p>
<h3 class="smcap" id="TheCommentators">The Commentators.</h3>
<p>Sun Tzŭ can boast an exceptionally long and distinguished roll of
commentators, which would do honour to any classic. <span lang="zh">歐陽修</span> Ou-yang Hsiu
remarks on this fact, though he wrote before the tale was complete,
and rather ingeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of
war, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXV">{XXXV}</span> inexhaustible, must therefore be susceptible of treatment
in a great variety of ways.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote93" id="FNanchor93">[93]</a></p>
<p>1. <span lang="zh">曹操</span> Ts‘ao Ts‘ao or <span lang="zh">曹公</span> Ts‘ao Kung, afterwards known as <span lang="zh">魏武帝</span> Wei
Wu Ti [A.D. 155–220]. There is hardly any room for doubt that the
earliest commentary on Sun Tzŭ actually came from the pen of this
extraordinary man, whose biography in the <cite>San Kuo Chih</cite><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote94" id="FNanchor94">[94]</a> reads
like a romance. One of the greatest military geniuses that the world
has seen, and Napoleonic in the scale of his operations, he was
especially famed for the marvellous rapidity of his marches, which has
found expression in the line <span lang="zh">說曹操曹操就到</span> “Talk of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, and
Ts‘ao Ts‘ao will appear.” Ou-yang Hsiu says of him that he was a great
captain who “measured his strength against Tung Cho, Lü Pu and the two
Yüan, father and son, and vanquished them all; whereupon he divided
the Empire of Han with Wu and Shu, and made himself king. It is
recorded that whenever a council of war was held by Wei on the eve
of a far-reaching campaign, he had all his calculations ready; those
generals who made use of them did not lose one battle in ten;
those who ran counter to them in any particular saw their armies
incontinently beaten and put to flight.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote95" id="FNanchor95">[95]</a> Ts‘ao Kung’s notes on Sun
Tzŭ, models of austere brevity, are so thoroughly characteristic
of the stern commander known to history, that it is hard indeed to
conceive of them as the work of a mere <i>littérateur</i>. Sometimes,
indeed, owing to extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXVI">{XXXVI}</span> compression, they are scarcely intelligible
and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text itself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote96" id="FNanchor96">[96]</a> As
we have seen, Ts‘ao Kung is the reputed author of the <span lang="zh">新書</span>, a book on
war in 100,000 odd words, now lost, but mentioned in the <span lang="zh">魏志</span>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote97" id="FNanchor97">[97]</a></p>
<p>2. <span lang="zh">孟氏</span> Mêng Shih. The commentary which has come down to us under this
name is comparatively meagre, and nothing about the author is known.
Even his personal name has not been recorded. Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition
places him after Chia Lin, and <span lang="zh">鼂公武</span> Ch‘ao Kung-wu also assigns him to
the T‘ang dynasty,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote98" id="FNanchor98">[98]</a> but this is obviously a mistake, as his work is
mentioned in the <span lang="zh">隋書經籍志</span>. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he appears as
Mêng Shih of the Liang dynasty [502–557]. Others would identify him
with <span lang="zh">孟康</span> Mêng K‘ang of the 3<sup>rd</sup> century. In the <span lang="zh">宋史藝文志</span>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote99" id="FNanchor99">[99]</a> he is
named last of the <span lang="zh">五家</span> “Five Commentators,” the others being Wei Wu Ti,
Tu Mu, Ch‘ên Hao and Chia Lin.</p>
<p>3. <span lang="zh">李筌</span> Li Ch‘üan of the 8<sup>th</sup> century was a well-known writer on
military tactics. His <span lang="zh">太白陰經</span> has been in constant use down to the
present day. The <span lang="zh">通志</span> mentions <span lang="zh">閫外春秋</span> (lives of famous generals from
the Chou to the T‘ang dynasty) as written by him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote100" id="FNanchor100">[100]</a> He is also
generally supposed to be the real author of the popular Taoist
tract, the <span lang="zh">陰符經</span>. According to Ch‘ao Kung-wu and the <cite>T‘ien-i-ko</cite>
catalogue,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote101" id="FNanchor101">[101]</a> he followed the <span lang="zh">太乙遁甲</span> text of Sun Tzŭ, which differs
considerably from those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXVII">{XXXVII}</span> now extant. His notes are mostly short and to
the point, and he frequently illustrates his remarks by anecdotes from
Chinese history.</p>
<p>4. <span lang="zh">杜佑</span> Tu Yu (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun
Tzŭ, his notes being taken from the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>, the encyclopaedic
treatise on the Constitution which was his life-work. They are largely
repetitions of Ts‘ao Kung and Mêng Shih, besides which it is believed
that he drew on the ancient commentaries of <span lang="zh">王凌</span> Wang Ling and others.
Owing to the peculiar arrangement of the <i>T‘ung Tien</i>, he has to explain
each passage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes his
own explanation does not agree with that of Ts‘ao Kung, whom he always
quotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the “Ten
Commentators,” he was added to their number by Chi T‘ien-pao, being
wrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu.</p>
<p>5. <span lang="zh">杜牧</span> Tu Mu (803–852) is perhaps best known as a poet—a bright star
even in the glorious galaxy of the T‘ang period. We learn from Ch‘ao
Kung-wu that although he had no practical experience of war, he was
extremely fond of discussing the subject, and was moreover well read
in the military history of the <i>Ch‘un Ch‘iu</i> and <i>Chan Kuo</i> eras.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote102" id="FNanchor102">[102]</a>
His notes, therefore, are well worth attention. They are very copious,
and replete with historical parallels. The gist of Sun Tzŭ’s work is
thus summarised by him: “Practise benevolence and justice, but on the
other hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote103" id="FNanchor103">[103]</a>
He further declared that all the military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXVIII">{XXXVIII}</span> triumphs and disasters of
the thousand years which had elapsed since Sun Wu’s death would, upon
examination, be found to uphold and corroborate, in every particular,
the maxims contained in his book.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote104" id="FNanchor104">[104]</a> Tu Mu’s somewhat spiteful
charge against Ts‘ao Kung has already been considered elsewhere.</p>
<p>6. <span lang="zh">陳皥</span> Ch‘ên Hao appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch‘ao
Kung-wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzŭ
because Ts‘ao Kung’s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and
that of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and diffuse.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote105" id="FNanchor105">[105]</a> Ou-yang
Hsiu, writing in the middle of the 11<sup>th</sup> century, calls Ts‘ao Kung, Tu
Mu and Ch‘ên Hao the three chief commentators on Sun Tzŭ (<span lang="zh">三家</span>), and
observes that Ch‘ên Hao is continually attacking Tu Mu’s shortcomings.
His commentary, though not lacking in merit, must rank below those of
his predecessors.</p>
<p>7. <span lang="zh">賈林</span> Chia Lin is known to have lived under the T‘ang dynasty, for
his commentary on Sun Tzŭ is mentioned in the <span lang="zh">唐書</span> and was afterwards
republished by <span lang="zh">紀燮</span> Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with those
of Mêng Shih and Tu Yu.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote106" id="FNanchor106">[106]</a> It is of somewhat scanty texture, and in
point of quality, too, perhaps the least valuable of the eleven.</p>
<p>8. <span lang="zh">梅堯臣</span> Mei Yao-ch‘ên (1002–1060), commonly known by his “style”
as Mei <span lang="zh">聖兪</span> Shêng-yü, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His
commentary was published with a laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang
Hsiu, from which we may cull the following:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Later scholars have misread Sun Tzŭ, distorting his words and
trying to make them square with their own one-sided views. Thus,
though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XXXIX">{XXXIX}</span> commentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved
equal to the task. My friend Shêng-yü has not fallen into this
mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary for Sun
Tzŭ’s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings
were intended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the
author is not concerned with the military conditions prevailing
under the sovereigns of the three ancient dynasties,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote107" id="FNanchor107">[107]</a> nor with
the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of War.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote108" id="FNanchor108">[108]</a>
Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always
deep. Whether the subject be marching an army, or handling
soldiers, or estimating the enemy, or controlling the forces of
victory, it is always systematically treated; the sayings are
bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been
obscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their
meaning. In his own commentary, Mei Shêng-yü has brushed aside all
the obstinate prejudices of these critics, and has tried to bring
out the true meaning of Sun Tzŭ himself. In this way, the clouds
of confusion have been dispersed and the sayings made clear. I am
convinced that the present work deserves to be handed down side by
side with the three great commentaries; and for a great deal that
they find in the sayings, coming generations will have constant
reason to thank my friend Shêng-yü.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote109" id="FNanchor109">[109]</a></p>
<p>Making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined
to endorse this favourable judgment, and would certainly place him
above Ch‘ên Hao in order of merit.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_XL">{XL}</p>
<p>9. <span lang="zh">王晳</span> Wang Hsi, also of the Sung dynasty, is decidedly original
in some of his interpretations, but much less judicious than Mei
Yao-ch‘ên, and on the whole not a very trustworthy guide. He is fond
of comparing his own commentary with that of Ts‘ao Kung, but the
comparison is not often flattering to him. We learn from Ch‘ao Kung-wu
that Wang Hsi revised the ancient text of Sun Tzŭ, filling up lacunae
and correcting mistakes.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote110" id="FNanchor110">[110]</a></p>
<p>10. <span lang="zh">何延錫</span> Ho Yen-hsi of the Sung dynasty. The personal name of this
commentator is given as above by <span lang="zh">鄭樵</span> Chêng Ch‘iao in the <cite>T‘ung Chih</cite>,
written about the middle of the twelfth century, but he appears simply
as <span lang="zh">何氏</span> Ho Shih in the <cite>Yü Hai</cite>, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes Ch‘ao Kung-wu
as saying that his personal name is unknown. There seems to be no
reason to doubt Chêng Ch‘iao’s statement, otherwise I should have
been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one <span lang="zh">何去非</span>
Ho Ch‘ü-fei, the author of a short treatise on war entitled <span lang="zh">備論</span>,
who lived in the latter part of the 11<sup>th</sup> century.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote111" id="FNanchor111">[111]</a> Ho Shih’s
commentary, in the words of the <cite>T‘ien-i-ko</cite> catalogue, <span lang="zh">有所裨益</span>
“contains helpful additions” here and there, but is chiefly remarkable
for the copious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the dynastic
histories and other sources.</p>
<p>11. <span lang="zh">張預</span> Chang Yü. The list closes with a commentator of no great
originality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of lucid
exposition. His commentary is based on that of Ts‘ao Kung, whose terse
sentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion.
Without Chang Yü, it is safe to say that much of Ts‘ao Kung’s
commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and
therefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history,
the <cite>T‘ung K‘ao</cite>, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLI">{XLI}</span> the <cite>Yü Hai</cite>, but it finds a niche in the <cite>T‘ung
Chih</cite>, which also names him as the author of the <span lang="zh">百將傳</span> “Lives of
Famous Generals.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote112" id="FNanchor112">[112]</a></p>
<p>It is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have
flourished within so short a space of time. Ch‘ao Kung-wu accounts for
it by saying: “During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire
enjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practise the art
of war. But when [Chao] Yüan-hao’s rebellion came [1038–42] and the
frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made
strenuous enquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became
the vogue amongst all the high officials. Hence it is that the
commentators of Sun Tzŭ in our dynasty belong mainly to that
period.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote113" id="FNanchor113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Besides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work
has not come down to us. The <cite>Sui Shu</cite> mentions four, namely <span lang="zh">王凌</span> Wang
Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu as <span lang="zh">王子</span>); <span lang="zh">張子尙</span> Chang Tzŭ-shang; <span lang="zh">賈詡</span> Chia
Hsü of <span lang="zh">魏</span> Wei;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote114" id="FNanchor114">[114]</a> and <span lang="zh">沈友</span> Shên Yu of 吳 Wu. The <cite>T‘ang Shu</cite> adds
<span lang="zh">孫鎬</span> Sun Hao, and the <cite>T‘ung Chih</cite> <span lang="zh">蕭吉</span> Hsiao Chi, while the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>
mentions a Ming commentator, <span lang="zh">黃潤玉</span> Huang Jun-yü. It is possible that
some of these may have been merely collectors and editors of other
commentaries, like Chi T‘ien-pao and Chi Hsieh, mentioned above.
Certainly in the case of the latter, the entry <span lang="zh">紀夑注孫子</span> in the <cite>T‘ung
K‘ao</cite>, without the following note, would give one to understand that
he had written an independent commentary of his own.</p>
<p>There are two works, described in the <cite>Ssu K‘u Ch‘üan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLII">{XLII}</span> Shu</cite><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote115" id="FNanchor115">[115]</a> and no
doubt extremely rare, which I should much like to have seen. One is
entitled <span lang="zh">孫子參同</span>, in 5 <i>chüan</i>. It gives selections from four new
commentators, probably of the Ming dynasty, as well as from the eleven
known to us. The names of the four are <span lang="zh">解元</span> Hsieh Yüan; <span lang="zh">張鏊</span> Chang Ao;
<span lang="zh">李村</span> Li Ts‘ai; and <span lang="zh">黃治徵</span> Huang Chih-chêng. The other work is <span lang="zh">孫子彚徵</span>
in 4 <i>chüan</i>, compiled by <span lang="zh">鄭端</span> Chêng Tuan of the present dynasty. It is
a compendium of information on ancient warfare, with special reference
to Sun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters.</p>
<h3 class="smcap" id="AppreciationsOfSunTzu">Appreciations of Sun Tzŭ.</h3>
<p>Sun Tzŭ has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of
China’s greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have
studied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned <span lang="zh">韓信</span> Han Hsin (<i>d</i>.
B.C. 196),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote116" id="FNanchor116">[116]</a> <span lang="zh">馮異</span> Fêng I (d. A.D. 34),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote117" id="FNanchor117">[117]</a> <span lang="zh">呂蒙</span> Lü Mêng (<i>d</i>.
219),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote118" id="FNanchor118">[118]</a> and <span lang="zh">岳飛</span> Yo Fei (1103–1141).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote119" id="FNanchor119">[119]</a> The opinion of Ts‘ao Kung,
who disputes with Han Hsin the highest place in Chinese military
annals, has already been recorded.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote120" id="FNanchor120">[120]</a> Still more remarkable, in one
way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as <span lang="zh">蘇洵</span> Su Hsün (the
father of Su Tung-p‘o), who wrote several essays on military topics,
all of which owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzŭ. The following
short passage by him is preserved in the <cite>Yü Hai:</cite><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote121" id="FNanchor121">[121]</a>—</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_XLIII">{XLIII}</p>
<p class="smaller">Sun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of
conquering,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote122" id="FNanchor122">[122]</a> is very different indeed from what other books
tell us.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote123" id="FNanchor123">[123]</a> Wu Ch‘i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they
both wrote books on war, and they are linked together in popular
speech as “Sun and Wu.” But Wu Ch‘i’s remarks on war are less
weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely stated, and there
is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzŭ’s work, where the
style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote124" id="FNanchor124">[124]</a></p>
<p>The <span lang="zh">性理彚要</span>, ch. 17, contains the following extract from the <span lang="zh">藝圃折衷</span>
“Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature” by <span lang="zh">鄭厚</span> Chêng Hou:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Sun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all
military men’s training, but also compel the most careful
attention of scholars and men of letters. His sayings are terse
yet elegant, simple yet profound, perspicuous and eminently
practical. Such works as the <cite>Lun Yü</cite>, the <cite>I Ching</cite> and the great
Commentary,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote125" id="FNanchor125">[125]</a> as well as the writings of Mencius, Hsün K‘uang
and Yang Chu, all fall below the level of Sun Tzŭ.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote126" id="FNanchor126">[126]</a></p>
<p>Chu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the
criticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with
the venerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says,
“encourages a ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless
militarism.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote127" id="FNanchor127">[127]</a></p>
<h3 class="smcap" id="ApologiesForWar">Apologies for War.</h3>
<p>Accustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving
nation on earth, we are in some danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLIV">{XLIV}</span> forgetting that her
experience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern
State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back to a point
at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great
Wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier
centuries before the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube.
What with the perpetual collisions of the ancient feudal States,
the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the
centralisation of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied
the overthrow of so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions
and minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one
by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never
ceased to resound in one portion or another of the Empire.</p>
<p>No less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom
China can point with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are
found emerging at the most fateful crises of her history. Thus, Po
Ch‘i stands out conspicuous in the period when Ch‘in was entering upon
her final struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy
years which followed the break-up of the Ch‘in dynasty are illumined
by the transcendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn
is tottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao
dominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T‘ang dynasty,
one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of
Li Shih-min (afterwards the Emperor T‘ai Tsung) was seconded by the
brilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear
comparison with the greatest names in the military history of Europe.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao
Tzŭ downwards, and especially as reflected in the standard literature
of Confucianism, has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed
to militarism in any form. It is such an uncommon thing to find any of
the literati<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLV">{XLV}</span> defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it
worth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the
unorthodox view is upheld. The following, by Ssŭ-ma Ch‘ien, shows that
for all his ardent admiration of Confucius, he was yet no advocate of
peace at any price:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Military weapons are the means used by the Sage to punish
violence and cruelty, to give peace to troublous times, to remove
difficulties and dangers, and to succour those who are in peril.
Every animal with blood in its veins and horns on its head will
fight when it is attacked. How much more so will man, who carries
in his breast the faculties of love and hatred, joy and anger!
When he is pleased, a feeling of affection springs up within him;
when angry, his poisoned sting is brought into play. That is the
natural law which governs his being.... What then shall be said of
those scholars of our time, blind to all great issues, and without
any appreciation of relative values, who can only bark out their
stale formulas about “virtue” and “civilisation,” condemning the
use of military weapons? They will surely bring our country to
impotence and dishonour and the loss of her rightful heritage; or,
at the very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion,
sacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they
obstinately refuse to modify the position they have taken up. The
truth is that, just as in the family the teacher must not spare
the rod, and punishments cannot be dispensed with in the State, so
military chastisement can never be allowed to fall into abeyance
in the Empire. All one can say is that this power will be
exercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and that among
those who bear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote128" id="FNanchor128">[128]</a></p>
<p>The next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on
Sun Tzŭ:—</p>
<p class="smaller">War may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of
government. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch‘iu, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLVI">{XLVI}</span>
disciples of Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and
hearing of litigation, the imprisonment of offenders and their
execution by flogging in the market-place, are all done by
officials. But the wielding of huge armies, the throwing down of
fortified cities, the haling of women and children into captivity,
and the beheading of traitors—this is also work which is done by
officials. The objects of the rack<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote129" id="FNanchor129">[129]</a> and of military weapons
are essentially the same. There is no intrinsic difference between
the punishment of flogging and cutting off heads in war. For the
lesser infractions of law, which are easily dealt with, only a
small amount of force need be employed: hence the institution of
torture and flogging. For more serious outbreaks of lawlessness,
which are hard to suppress, a greater amount of force is
necessary: hence the use of military weapons and wholesale
decapitation. In both cases, however, the end in view is to get
rid of wicked people, and to give comfort and relief to the
good....<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote130" id="FNanchor130">[130]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">Chi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: “Have you, Sir, acquired your
military aptitude by study, or is it innate?” Jan Yu replied: “It
has been acquired by study.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote131" id="FNanchor131">[131]</a> “How can that be so,” said
Chi-sun, “seeing that you are a disciple of Confucius?” “It is a
fact,” replied Jan Yu; “I was taught by Confucius. It is fitting
that the great Sage should exercise both civil and military
functions, though to be sure my instruction in the art of fighting
has not yet gone very far.”</p>
<p class="smaller">Now, who the author was of this rigid distinction between the
“civil” and the “military,” and the limitation of each to a
separate sphere of action, or in what year of which dynasty it
was first introduced, is more than I can say. But, at any rate,
it has come about that the members of the governing class are
quite afraid of enlarging on military topics, or do so only in a
shamefaced manner. If any are bold enough to discuss the subject,
they are at once set down as eccentric individuals of coarse and
brutal propensities. This is an extraordinary instance of the way
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLVII">{XLVII}</span> which, through sheer lack of reasoning, men unhappily lose
sight of fundamental principles.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote132" id="FNanchor132">[132]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">When the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch‘êng Wang, he
regulated ceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of
scholarship and learning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai
revolted,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote133" id="FNanchor133">[133]</a> he sallied forth and chastised them. When Confucius
held office under the Duke of Lu, and a meeting was convened at
Chia-ku,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote134" id="FNanchor134">[134]</a> he said: “If pacific negotiations are in progress,
warlike preparations should have been made beforehand.” He rebuked
and shamed the Marquis of Ch‘i, who cowered under him and dared
not proceed to violence. How can it be said that these two great
Sages had no knowledge of military matters?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote135" id="FNanchor135">[135]</a></p>
<p>We have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzŭ in high esteem. He
also appeals to the authority of the Classics:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Our Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: “I have
never studied matters connected with armies and battalions.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote136" id="FNanchor136">[136]</a>
Replying to K‘ung Wên-tzŭ, he said: “I have not been instructed
about buff-coats and weapons.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote137" id="FNanchor137">[137]</a> But if we turn to the meeting
at Chia-ku,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote138" id="FNanchor138">[138]</a> we find that he used armed force against the men
of Lai,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote139" id="FNanchor139">[139]</a> so that the marquis of Ch‘i was overawed. Again, when
the inhabitants of Pi revolted, he ordered his officers to attack
them, whereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote140" id="FNanchor140">[140]</a>
He once uttered the words: “If I fight, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLVIII">{XLVIII}</span> conquer.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote141" id="FNanchor141">[141]</a> And
Jan Yu also said: “The Sage exercises both civil and military
functions.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote142" id="FNanchor142">[142]</a> Can it be a fact that Confucius never studied or
received instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he
did not specially choose matters connected with armies and
fighting to be the subject of his teaching.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote143" id="FNanchor143">[143]</a></p>
<p>Sun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzŭ, writes in similar strain:—</p>
<p class="smaller">Confucius said: “I am unversed in military matters.” He also
said: “If I fight, I conquer.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote144" id="FNanchor144">[144]</a> Confucius ordered ceremonies
and regulated music. Now war constitutes one of the five
classes of State ceremonial,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote145" id="FNanchor145">[145]</a> and must not be treated as an
independent branch of study. Hence, the words “I am unversed in”
must be taken to mean that there are things which even an inspired
Teacher does not know. Those who have to lead an army and devise
stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if one can command the
services of a good general like Sun Tzŭ, who was employed by Wu
Tzŭ-hsü, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the remark
added by Confucius: “If I fight, I conquer.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote146" id="FNanchor146">[146]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">The men of the present day, however, wilfully interpret these
words of Confucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant
that books on the art of war were not worth reading. With blind
persistency, they adduce the example of Chao Kua, who pored over
his father’s books to no purpose,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote147" id="FNanchor147">[147]</a> as a proof that all
military theory is useless. Again, seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_XLIX">{XLIX}</span> that books on war have
to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans, and
the conversion of spies, they hold that the art is immoral and
unworthy of a sage. These people ignore the fact that the studies
of our scholars and the civil administration of our officials
also require steady application and practice before efficiency is
reached. The ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere
novices to botch their work.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote148" id="FNanchor148">[148]</a> Weapons are baneful<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote149" id="FNanchor149">[149]</a> and
fighting perilous; and unless a general is in constant practice,
he ought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote150" id="FNanchor150">[150]</a> Hence it
is essential that Sun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters should be studied.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote151" id="FNanchor151">[151]</a></p>
<p class="smaller">Hsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote152" id="FNanchor152">[152]</a> in the art of
war. Chi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings,
but would not pursue his studies to their proper outcome, the
consequence being that he was finally defeated and overthrown. He
did not realise that the tricks and artifices of war are beyond
verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote153" id="FNanchor153">[153]</a> and King Yen of
Hsü<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote154" id="FNanchor154">[154]</a> were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity.
The treacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use
of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on
record of Confucius himself having violated an extorted oath,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote155" id="FNanchor155">[155]</a>
and also of his having left the Sung State in disguise.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote156" id="FNanchor156">[156]</a> Can
we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzŭ for disregarding truth and
honesty?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote157" id="FNanchor157">[157]</a></p>

<p>The following are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tzŭ.
The notes on each have been drawn principally from the <span lang="zh">四庫全書簡明目錄</span>
<i>Ssŭ k‘u ch‘üan shu chien ming mu lu</i>, ch. 9, fol. 22 <i>sqq</i>.</p>
<p>1. <span lang="zh">吳子</span> <b>Wu Tzŭ</b>, in 1 <i>chüan</i> or 6 <span lang="zh">篇</span> chapters. By <span lang="zh">吳起</span> Wu Ch‘i (<i>d</i>.
B.C. 381). A genuine work. See <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, ch. 65.</p>
<p>2. <span lang="zh">司馬法</span> <b>Ssŭ-ma Fa</b>, in 1 <i>chüan</i> or 5 chapters. Wrongly attributed to
<span lang="zh">司馬穰苴</span> Ssŭ-ma Jang-chü of the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C. Its date, however, must
be early, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly
to be met with in its pages.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote158" id="FNanchor158">[158]</a> See <cite>Shih chi</cite>, ch. 64.</p>
<p>The <cite>Ssŭ K‘u Ch‘üan Shu</cite> (ch. 99, f. 1) remarks that the oldest three
treatises on war, <cite>Sun Tzŭ</cite>, <cite>Wu Tzŭ</cite> and the <cite>Ssŭ-ma Fa</cite>, are,
generally speaking, only concerned with things strictly military—the
art of producing, collecting, training and drilling troops, and the
correct theory with regard to measures of expediency, laying plans,
transport of goods and the handling of soldiers<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote159" id="FNanchor159">[159]</a>—in strong contrast
to later works, in which the science of war is usually blended with
metaphysics, divination and magical arts in general.</p>
<p>3. <span lang="zh">六韜</span> <b>Liu T‘ao</b>, in 6 <i>chüan</i> or 60 chapters. Attributed to <span lang="zh">呂望</span> Lü
Wang (or Lü <span lang="zh">尙</span> Shang, also known as <span lang="zh">太公</span> T‘ai Kung) of the 12<sup>th</sup> century
B.C.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote160" id="FNanchor160">[160]</a> But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_LI">{LI}</span> its style does not belong to the era of the Three
Dynasties.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote161" id="FNanchor161">[161]</a> <span lang="zh">陸德明</span> Lu Tê-ming (550–625 A.D.) mentions the work, and
enumerates the headings of the six sections, <span lang="zh">文</span>, <span lang="zh">武</span>, <span lang="zh">虎</span>, <span lang="zh">豹</span>, <span lang="zh">龍</span> and <span lang="zh">犬</span>,
so that the forgery cannot have been later than the Sui dynasty.</p>
<p>4. <span lang="zh">尉繚子</span> <b>Wei Liao Tzŭ</b>, in 5 <i>chüan</i>. Attributed to Wei Liao (4<sup>th</sup> cent.
B.C.), who studied under the famous <span lang="zh">鬼谷子</span> Kuei-ku Tzŭ. The <span lang="zh">漢志</span>, under
<span lang="zh">兵家</span>, mentions a book of Wei Liao in 31 chapters, whereas the text we
possess contains only 24. Its matter is sound enough in the main,
though the strategical devices differ considerably from those of the
Warring States period.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote162" id="FNanchor162">[162]</a> It has been furnished with a commentary by
the well-known Sung philosopher <span lang="zh">張載</span> Chang Tsai.</p>
<p>5. <span lang="zh">三略</span> <b>San Lüeh</b>, in 3 <i>chüan</i>. Attributed to <span lang="zh">黃石公</span> Huang-shih Kung, a
legendary personage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang Liang
(<i>d</i>. B.C. 187) in an interview on a bridge.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote163" id="FNanchor163">[163]</a> But here again, the
style is not that of works dating from the Ch‘in or Han period. The
Han Emperor Kuang Wu [A.D. 25–57] apparently quotes from it in one of
his proclamations; but the passage in question may have been inserted
later on, in order to prove the genuineness of the work. We shall not
be far out if we refer it to the Northern Sung period [420–478 A.D.],
or somewhat earlier.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote164" id="FNanchor164">[164]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_LII">{LII}</p>
<p>6. <span lang="zh">李衞公問對</span> <b>Li Wei Kung Wên Tui</b>, in 3 sections. Written in the form
of a dialogue between T‘ai Tsung and his great general <span lang="zh">李靖</span> Li Ching,
it is usually ascribed to the latter. Competent authorities consider
it a forgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art
of war.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote165" id="FNanchor165">[165]</a></p>
<p>7. <span lang="zh">李靖兵法</span> <b>Li Ching Ping Fa</b> (not to be confounded with the foregoing)
is a short treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>, but
not published separately. This fact explains its omission from the
<cite>Ssŭ K‘u Ch‘üan Shu</cite>.</p>
<p>8. <span lang="zh">握奇經</span> <b>Wu Ch‘i Ching</b>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote166" id="FNanchor166">[166]</a> in 1 <i>chüan</i>. Attributed to the legendary
minister <span lang="zh">風后</span> Fêng Hou, with exegetical notes by <span lang="zh">公孫宏</span> Kung-sun Hung
of the Han dynasty (<i>d</i>. B.C. 121), and said to have been eulogised by
the celebrated general <span lang="zh">馬隆</span> Ma Lung (<i>d</i>. A.D. 300). Yet the earliest
mention of it is in the <span lang="zh">宋志</span>. Although a forgery, the work is well put
together.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote167" id="FNanchor167">[167]</a></p>
<p>Considering the high popular estimation in which <span lang="zh">諸葛亮</span> Chu-ko Liang
has always been held, it is not surprising to find more than one work
on war ascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the <span lang="zh">十六策</span> <b>Shih Liu Ts‘ê</b> (1
<i>chüan</i>), preserved in the <span lang="zh">永樂大典</span> <cite>Yung Lo Ta Tien</cite>; (2) <span lang="zh">將苑</span> <b>Chiang
Yüan</b> (1 <i>ch</i>.); and (3) <span lang="zh">心書</span> <b>Hsin Shu</b> (1 <i>ch</i>.), which steals wholesale
from Sun Tzŭ. None of these has the slightest claim to be considered
genuine.</p>

LAYING PLANS.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">This is the only possible meaning of <span lang="zh">計</span>, which M. Amiot and Capt.
Calthrop wrongly translate “Fondements de l’art militaire” and
“First principles” respectively. Ts‘ao Kung says it refers to the
deliberations in the temple selected by the general for his
temporary use, or as we should say, in his tent. See § 26.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰兵者國之大事</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 死生之地存亡之道不可不察也</p>
<p>It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 故經之以五校之以計而索其情</p>
<p>The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be
taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine
the conditions obtaining in the field.</p>
<p class="annot">The old text of the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has <span lang="zh">故經之以五校之計</span>, etc. Later
editors have inserted <span lang="zh">事</span> after <span lang="zh">五</span>, and <span lang="zh">以</span> before <span lang="zh">計</span>. The former
correction is perhaps superfluous, but the latter seems necessary
in order to make sense, and is supported by the accepted reading
in § 12, where the same words recur. I am inclined to think,
however, that the whole sentence from <span lang="zh">校</span> to <span lang="zh">情</span> is an interpolation
and has no business here at all. If it be retained, Wang Hsi must
be right in saying that <span lang="zh">計</span> denotes the “seven considerations” in §
13. <span lang="zh">情</span> are the circumstances or conditions likely to bring about
victory or defeat. The antecedent of the first <span lang="zh">之</span> is <span lang="zh">兵者</span>; of the
second, <span lang="zh">五</span>. <span lang="zh">校</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">{2}</span> contains the idea of “comparison with the enemy,”
which cannot well be brought out here, but will appear in § 12.
Altogether, difficult though it is, the passage is not so
hopelessly corrupt as to justify Capt. Calthrop in burking it
entirely.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 一曰道二曰天三曰地四曰將五曰法</p>
<p>These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The
Commander; (5) Method and discipline.</p>
<p class="annot">It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by <span lang="zh">道</span> a principle
of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral aspect. One
might be tempted to render it by “morale,” were it not considered
as an attribute of the <em>ruler</em> in § 13.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 道者令民與上同意也</p>
<p class="ctext2" lang="zh">6. 故可與之死可與之生而民不畏危</p>
<p><em>The Moral Law</em> causes the people to be in complete accord with their
ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,
undismayed by any danger.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text omits <span lang="zh">令民</span>, inserts an <span lang="zh">以</span> after each <span lang="zh">可</span>, and
omits <span lang="zh">民</span> after <span lang="zh">而</span>. Capt. Calthrop translates: “If the ruling
authority be upright, the people are united”—a very pretty
sentiment, but wholly out of place in what purports to be a
translation of Sun Tzŭ.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 天者陰陽寒暑時制也</p>
<p><em>Heaven</em> signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.</p>
<p class="annot">The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of <span lang="zh">陰陽</span>.
Thus Mêng Shih defines the words as <span lang="zh">剛柔盈縮</span> “the hard and the
soft, waxing and waning,” which does not help us much. Wang Hsi,
however, may be right in saying that what is meant is <span lang="zh">總天道</span> “the
general economy of Heaven,” including the five elements, the four
seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 地者遠近險易廣狹死生也</p>
<p><em>Earth</em> comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;
open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">死生</span> (omitted by Capt. Calthrop) may have been included here
because the safety of an army depends largely on its quickness to
turn these geographical features to account.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_3">{3}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 將者智信仁勇嚴也</p>
<p><em>The Commander</em> stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,
benevolence, courage and strictness.</p>
<p class="annot">The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) <span lang="zh">仁</span> humanity or
benevolence; (2) <span lang="zh">義</span> uprightness of mind; (3) <span lang="zh">禮</span> self-respect,
self-control, or “proper feeling;” (4) <span lang="zh">智</span> wisdom; (5) <span lang="zh">信</span> sincerity
or good faith. Here <span lang="zh">智</span> and <span lang="zh">信</span> are put before <span lang="zh">仁</span>, and the two
military virtues of “courage” and “strictness” substituted for <span lang="zh">義</span>
and <span lang="zh">禮</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 法者曲制官道主用也</p>
<p>By <em>Method and discipline</em> are to be understood the marshalling of the
army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the
officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the
army, and the control of military expenditure.</p>
<p class="annot">The Chinese of this sentence is so concise as to be practically
unintelligible without commentary. I have followed the
interpretation of Ts‘ao Kung, who joins <span lang="zh">曲制</span> and again <span lang="zh">主用</span>. Others
take each of the six predicates separately. <span lang="zh">曲</span> has the somewhat
uncommon sense of “cohort” or division of an army. Capt. Calthrop
translates: “Partition and ordering of troops,” which only covers
<span lang="zh">曲制</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 凡此五者將莫不聞知之者勝不知者不勝</p>
<p>These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows
them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 故校之以計而索其情</p>
<p>Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the
military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in
this wise:—</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> has an interpolated <span lang="zh">五</span> before <span lang="zh">計</span>. It is obvious,
however, that the <span lang="zh">五者</span> just enumerated cannot be described as <span lang="zh">計</span>.
Capt. Calthrop, forced to give some rendering of the words which
he had omitted in § 3, shows himself decidedly hazy: “Further,
with regard to these and the following seven matters, the
condition of the enemy must be compared with our own.” He does not
appear to see that the seven queries or considerations which
follow arise directly out of the Five heads, instead of being
supplementary to them.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_4">{4}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 曰主孰有道將孰有能天地孰得法令孰行兵衆孰强士卒孰練賞罰孰明</p>
<p>(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?</p>
<p class="annot">I.e., “is in harmony with his subjects.” Cf. § 5.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?</p>
<p class="annot">See §§ 7, 8.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao (A.D.
155–220), who was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in
accordance with his own severe regulations against injury to
standing crops, he condemned himself to death for having allowed
his horse to shy into a field of corn! However, in lieu of losing
his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by
cutting off his hair. Ts‘ao Ts‘ao’s own comment on the present
passage is characteristically curt: <span lang="zh">設而不犯犯而必誅</span> “when you lay
down a law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed, the
offender must be put to death.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(5) Which army is the stronger?</p>
<p class="annot">Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch‘ên puts it, <span lang="zh">內和外附</span>,
which might be freely rendered “esprit de corps and ‘big
battalions.’”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Yu quotes <span lang="zh">王子</span> as saying: “Without constant practice, the
officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;
without constant practice, the general will be wavering and
irresolute when the crisis is at hand.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and
punishment?</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">明</span>, literally “clear;” that is, on which side is there the most
absolute certainty that merit will be properly rewarded and
misdeeds summarily punished?</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 吾以此知勝負矣</p>
<p>By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_5">{5}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 將聽吾計用之必勝留之將不聽吾計用之必敗去之</p>
<p>The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will
conquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that
hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:—let
such a one be dismissed!</p>
<p class="annot">The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was
composed expressly for the benefit of his patron <span lang="zh">闔閭</span> Ho Lü, king of
the Wu State. It is not necessary, however, to understand <span lang="zh">我</span> before
<span lang="zh">留之</span> (as some commentators do), or to take <span lang="zh">將</span> as “generals under my
command.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 計利以聽乃爲之勢以佐其外</p>
<p>While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any
helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop blunders amazingly over this sentence: “Wherefore, with
regard to the foregoing, considering that with us lies the advantage,
and the generals agreeing, we create a situation which promises
victory.” Mere logic should have kept him from penning such frothy
balderdash.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 勢者因利而制權也</p>
<p>According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s
plans.</p>
<p class="annot">Sun Tzŭ, as a practical soldier, will have none of the “bookish
theoric.” He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract
principles; “for,” as Chang Yü puts it, “while the main laws of
strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and
sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting
to secure a favourable position in actual warfare.” On the eve of the
battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the
Duke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations
were for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find
himself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a
critical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: “Who will
attack the first to-morrow—I or Bonaparte?” “Bonaparte,” replied Lord
Uxbridge. “Well,” continued the Duke, “Bonaparte has not given me any
idea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can
you expect me to tell you what mine are?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote168" id="FNanchor168">[168]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_6">{6}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 兵者詭道也</p>
<p>All warfare is based on deception.</p>
<p class="annot">The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by
every soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in
so many military qualities, was especially distinguished by “the
extraordinary skill with which he concealed his movements and
deceived both friend and foe.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 故能而示之不能用而示之不用近而示之遠遠而示之近</p>
<p>Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our
forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the
enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe
we are near.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 利而誘之亂而取之</p>
<p>Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">取</span>, as often in Sun Tzŭ, is used in the sense of <span lang="zh">擊</span>. It is rather
remarkable that all the commentators, with the exception of Chang
Yü, refer <span lang="zh">亂</span> to the enemy: “when he is in disorder, crush him.” It
is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzŭ is still illustrating the
uses of deception in war.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">21. 實而備之强而避之</p>
<p>If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in
superior strength, evade him.</p>
<p class="annot">The meaning of <span lang="zh">實</span> is made clear from chap. VI, where it is opposed
to <span lang="zh">虛</span> “weak or vulnerable spots.” <span lang="zh">强</span>, according to Tu Yu and other
commentators, has reference to the keenness of the men as well as
to numerical superiority. Capt. Calthrop evolves an
extraordinarily far-fetched translation: “If there are defects,
give an appearance of perfection, and awe the enemy. Pretend to be
strong, and so cause the enemy to avoid you”!</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">22. 怒而撓之卑而驕之</p>
<p>If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend
to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.</p>
<p class="annot">I follow Chang Yü in my interpretation of <span lang="zh">怒</span>. <span lang="zh">卑</span> is expanded by Mei
Yao-ch‘ên into <span lang="zh">示以卑弱</span>. Wang Tzŭ, quoted by Tu Yu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">{7}</span> says that the
good tactician plays with his adversary as a cat plays with a
mouse, first feigning weakness and immobility, and then suddenly
pouncing upon him.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">23. 佚而勞之親而離之</p>
<p>If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.</p>
<p class="annot">This is probably the meaning, though Mei Yao-ch‘ên has the note:
<span lang="zh">以我之佚待彼之勞</span> “while we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy
to tire himself out.” The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> has <span lang="zh">引而勞之</span> “Lure him on and
tire him out.” This would seem also to have been Ts‘ao Kung’s
text, judging by his comment <span lang="zh">以利勞之</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">If his forces are united, separate them.</p>
<p class="annot">Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the
commentators: “If sovereign and subject are in accord, put
division between them.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">24. 攻其無備出其不意</p>
<p>Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">25. 此兵家之勝不可先傳也</p>
<p>These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged
beforehand.</p>
<p class="annot">This seems to be the way in which Ts‘ao Kung understood the
passage, and is perhaps the best sense to be got out of the text
as it stands. Most of the commentators give the following
explanation: “It is impossible to lay down rules for warfare
before you come into touch with the enemy.” This would be very
plausible if it did not ignore <span lang="zh">此</span>, which unmistakably refers to the
maxims which Sun Tzŭ has been laying down. It is possible, of
course, that <span lang="zh">此</span> may be a later interpolation, in which case the
sentence would practically mean: “Success in warfare cannot be
taught.” As an alternative, however, I would venture to suggest
that a second <span lang="zh">不</span> may have fallen out after <span lang="zh">可</span>, so that we get:
“These maxims for succeeding in war are the first that ought to be
imparted.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">26. 夫未戰而廟算勝者得算多也未戰而廟算不勝者得算少也多算勝少算不勝而況於無算
乎吾以此觀之勝負見矣</p>
<p>Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his
temple ere the battle is fought.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_8">{8}</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a
temple to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to
take the field, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of
campaign. Capt. Calthrop misunderstands it as “the shrine of the
ancestors,” and gives a loose and inaccurate rendering of the
whole passage.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.
Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to
defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to
this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.</p>

WAGING WAR.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung has the note: <span lang="zh">欲戰必先算其費務</span> “He who wishes to fight
must first count the cost,” which prepares us for the discovery
that the subject of the chapter is not what we might expect from
the title, but is primarily a consideration of ways and means.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰凡用兵之法馳車千駟革車千乘帶甲十萬千里饋糧則內外之費賓客之用膠漆之材
車甲之奉日費千金然後十萬之師舉矣</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a
thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred
thousand mail-clad soldiers,</p>
<p class="annot">The <span lang="zh">馳車</span> were lightly built and, according to Chang Yü, used for
the attack; the <span lang="zh">革車</span> were heavier, and designed for purposes of
defence. Li Ch‘üan, it is true, says that the latter were light,
but this seems hardly probable. Capt. Calthrop translates
“chariots” and “supply wagons” respectively, but is not supported
by any commentator. It is interesting to note the analogies
between early Chinese warfare and that of the Homeric Greeks. In
each case, the war-chariot was the important factor, forming as it
did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of
foot-soldiers. With regard to the numbers given here, we are
informed that each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen,
and each heavy chariot by 25 footmen, so that the whole army would
be divided up into a thousand battalions, each consisting of two
chariots and a hundred men.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">with provisions enough to carry them a thousand <i>li</i>,</p>
<p class="annot">2.78 modern <i>li</i> go to a mile. The length may have varied slightly
since Sun Tzŭ’s time.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of
guests, small items such as glue and paint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">{10}</span> and sums spent on chariots
and armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">則</span>, which follows <span lang="zh">糧</span> in the <i>textus receptus</i>, is important as
indicating the apodosis. In the text adopted by Capt. Calthrop it
is omitted, so that he is led to give this meaningless translation
of the opening sentence: “Now the requirements of War are such
that we need 1,000 chariots,” etc. The second <span lang="zh">費</span>, which is
redundant, is omitted in the <cite>Yü Lan</cite>. <span lang="zh">千金</span>, like <span lang="zh">千里</span> above, is
meant to suggest a large but indefinite number. As the Chinese
have never possessed gold coins, it is incorrect to translate it
“1000 pieces of gold.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop adds: “You have the instruments of victory,” which
he seems to get from the first five characters of the next sentence.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 其用戰也勝久則鈍兵挫銳攻城則力屈</p>
<p>When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, the
men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> omits <span lang="zh">勝</span>; but though <span lang="zh">勝久</span> is certainly a bold phrase,
it is more likely to be right than not. Both in this place and in
§ 4, the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> read <span lang="zh">頓</span> (in the sense of “to
injure”) instead of <span lang="zh">鈍</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.</p>
<p class="annot">As synonyms to 屈 are given 盡, 殫, 窮 and 困.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 久暴師則國用不足</p>
<p>Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will
not be equal to the strain.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">久暴師</span> means literally, “If there is long exposure of the army.”
Of <span lang="zh">暴</span> in this sense K‘ang Hsi cites an instance from the biography
of <span lang="zh">竇融</span> Tou Jung in the <cite>Hou Han Shu</cite> where the commentary defines
it by <span lang="zh">露</span>. Cf. also the following from the <span lang="zh">戰國策</span>: <span lang="zh">將軍久暴露於外</span>
“General, you have long been exposed to all weathers.”</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_11">{11}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 夫鈍兵挫銳屈力殫貨則諸侯乘其幣而起雖有智者不能善其後矣</p>
<p>Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength
exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to
take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be
able to avert the consequences that must ensue.</p>
<p class="annot">Following Tu Yu, I understand <span lang="zh">善</span> in the sense of “to make good,”
i.e. to mend. But Tu Mu and Ho Shih explain it as “to make good
plans”—for the future.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 故兵聞拙速未睹巧之久也</p>
<p>Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has
never been seen associated with long delays.</p>
<p class="annot">This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any
of the commentators. Ts‘ao Kung, Li Ch‘üan, Mêng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu
Mu and Mei Yao-ch‘ên have notes to the effect that a general,
though naturally stupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer
force of rapidity. Ho Shih says: “Haste may be stupid, but at any
rate it saves expenditure of energy and treasure; protracted
operations may be very clever, but they bring calamity in their
train.” Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by remarking: “Lengthy
operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expended, an
empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness
insures against the occurrence of such calamities.” Chang Yü says:
“So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to
clever dilatoriness.” Now Sun Tzŭ says nothing whatever, except
possibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better
than ingenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is
something much more guarded, namely that, while speed may
sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be anything but
foolish—if only because it means impoverishment to the nation.
Capt. Calthrop indulges his imagination with the following:
“Therefore it is acknowledged that war cannot be too short in
duration. But though conducted with the utmost art, if long
continuing, misfortunes do always appear.” It is hardly worth
while to note the total disappearance of <span lang="zh">拙速</span> in this precious
concoction. In considering the point raised here by Sun Tzŭ, the
classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the
mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome
against that of Hannibal’s isolated army, because it seemed to him
that the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in
a strange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his
tactics would have proved successful in the long run. Their
reversal, it is true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a
negative presumption in their favour.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_12">{12}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 夫兵久而國利者未之有也</p>
<p>There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged
warfare.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> has <span lang="zh">圖</span> instead of <span lang="zh">國</span>—evidently the mistake of a scribe.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 故不盡知用兵之害者則不能盡知用兵之利也</p>
<p>It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that
can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.</p>
<p class="annot">That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects
of a long war can realise the supreme importance of rapidity in
bringing it to a close. Only two commentators seem to favour this
interpretation, but it fits well into the logic of the context,
whereas the rendering, “He who does not know the evils of war
cannot appreciate its benefits,” is distinctly pointless.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 善用兵者役不再籍糧不三載</p>
<p>The skilful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his
supply-waggons loaded more than twice.</p>
<p class="annot">Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting
for reinforcements, nor will he turn his army back for fresh
supplies, but crosses the enemy’s frontier without delay. This may
seem an audacious policy to recommend, but with all great
strategists, from Julius Caesar to Napoleon Buonaparte, the value
of time—that is, being a little ahead of your opponent—has counted
for more than either numerical superiority or the nicest
calculations with regard to commissariat. <span lang="zh">籍</span> is used in the sense
of <span lang="zh">賦</span>. The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> have the inferior reading <span lang="zh">藉</span>.
The commentators explain <span lang="zh">不三載</span> by saying that the waggons are
loaded once before passing the frontier, and that the army is met
by a further consignment of supplies on the homeward march. The
<cite>Yü Lan</cite>, however, reads <span lang="zh">再</span> here as well.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 取用於國因糧於敵故軍食可足也</p>
<p>Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus
the army will have food enough for its needs.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">用</span>, “things to be used,” in the widest sense. It includes all the
impedimenta of an army, apart from provisions.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_13">{13}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 國之貧於師者遠輸遠輸則百姓貧</p>
<p>Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by
contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a
distance causes the people to be impoverished.</p>
<p class="annot">The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the
next, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement,
moreover, is so awkward that I cannot help suspecting some
corruption in the text. It never seems to occur to Chinese
commentators that an emendation may be necessary for the sense,
and we get no help from them here. Sun Tzŭ says that the cause of
the people’s impoverishment is <span lang="zh">遠輸</span>; it is clear, therefore, that
the words have reference to some system by which the husbandmen
sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why
should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except
because the State or Government is too poor to do so? Assuming
then that <span lang="zh">貧</span> ought to stand first in the sentence in order to
balance <span lang="zh">近</span> (the fact that the two words rhyme is significant), and
thus getting rid of <span lang="zh">國之</span>, we are still left with <span lang="zh">於師</span>, which latter
word seems to me an obvious mistake for <span lang="zh">國</span>. “Poverty in the army”
is an unlikely expression, especially as the general has just been
warned not to encumber his army with a large quantity of supplies.
If we suppose that <span lang="zh">師</span> somehow got written here instead of <span lang="zh">國</span> (a
very simple supposition, as we have <span lang="zh">近於師</span> in the next sentence),
and that later on somebody, scenting a mistake, prefixed the gloss
<span lang="zh">國之</span> to <span lang="zh">貧</span>, without however erasing <span lang="zh">於師</span>, the whole muddle may be
explained. My emended text then would be <span lang="zh">貧於國者</span>, etc.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 近於師者貴賣貴賣則百姓財竭</p>
<p>On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up;
and high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">近</span>, that is, as Wang Hsi says, before the army has left its own
territory. Ts‘ao Kung understands it of an army that has already
crossed the frontier. Capt. Calthrop drops the <span lang="zh">於</span>, reading <span lang="zh">近師者</span>,
but even so it is impossible to justify his translation “Repeated
wars cause high prices.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 財竭則急於丘役</p>
<p>When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted
by heavy exactions.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_14">{14}</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. Mencius VII. 2. xiv. 2, where <span lang="zh">丘民</span> has the same meaning as
<span lang="zh">丘役</span>. <span lang="zh">丘</span> was an ancient measure of land. The full table, as given
by <span lang="zh">司馬法</span>, may not be out of place here: 6 <span lang="zh">尺</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">步</span>; 100 <span lang="zh">步</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">畝</span>;
100 <span lang="zh">畝</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">夫</span>; 3 <span lang="zh">夫</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">屋</span>; 3 <span lang="zh">屋</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">井</span>; 4 <span lang="zh">井</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">邑</span>; 4 <span lang="zh">邑</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">丘</span>; 4
<span lang="zh">丘</span> = 1 <span lang="zh">甸</span>. According to the <cite>Chou Li</cite>, there were nine husbandmen
to a <span lang="zh">井</span>, which would assign to each man the goodly allowance of
100 <span lang="zh">畝</span> (of which 6.6 now go to an acre). What the values of these
measures were in Sun Tzŭ’s time is not known with any certainty.
The lineal <span lang="zh">尺</span>, however, is supposed to have been about 20 cm. <span lang="zh">急</span>
may include levies of men, as well as other exactions.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 力屈財殫中原內虛於家百姓之費十去其七</p>

<p>With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of
the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their incomes
will be dissipated;</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> omits <span lang="zh">財殫</span>. I would propose the emended reading
<span lang="zh">力屈則中</span>, etc. In view of the fact that we have <span lang="zh">財竭</span> in the two
preceding paragraphs, it seems probable that <span lang="zh">財</span> is a scribe’s
mistake for <span lang="zh">則</span>, <span lang="zh">殫</span> having been added afterwards to make sense.
<span lang="zh">中原內虛於家</span>, literally: “Within the middle plains there is
emptiness in the homes.” For <span lang="zh">中原</span> cf. <cite>Shih Ching</cite> II. 3. vi. 3 and
II. 5. ii. 3. With regard to <span lang="zh">十去其七</span>, Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">家業十耗其七也</span>,
and Wang Hsi: <span lang="zh">民費大半矣</span>; that is, the people are mulcted not of
3⁄10, but of 7⁄10, of their income. But this is hardly to be
extracted from our text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag:
<span lang="zh">國以民爲本民以食爲天居人上者宜乎重惜</span> “The <em>people</em> being regarded as
the essential part of the State, and <em>food</em> as the people’s
heaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and
be careful of both?”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">while Government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,
breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,
protective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to
four-tenths of its total revenue.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_15">{15}</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> has several various readings here, the more important
of which are <span lang="zh">疲</span> for the less common <span lang="zh">罷</span> (read p‘i<sup>2</sup>), <span lang="zh">干</span> for <span lang="zh">蔽</span>,
and <span lang="zh">兵牛</span> for <span lang="zh">丘牛</span>, which latter, if right, must mean “oxen from the
country districts” (cf. <i>supra</i>, § 12). For the meaning of <span lang="zh">櫓</span>, see
note on III, § 4. Capt. Calthrop omits to translate <span lang="zh">丘牛大車</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 故智將務食於敵食敵一鍾當吾二十鍾𦮼秆一石當吾二十石</p>
<p>Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One
cartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s
own, and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to
twenty from one’s own store.</p>
<p class="annot">Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of
transporting one cartload to the front. According to Ts‘ao Kung, a
<span lang="zh">鍾</span> = 6 <span lang="zh">斛</span> 4 <span lang="zh">㪷</span>, or 64 <span lang="zh">㪷</span>, but according to Mêng Shih, 10 <span lang="zh">斛</span> make a
<span lang="zh">鍾</span>. The <span lang="zh">石</span> picul consisted of 70 <span lang="zh">斤</span> catties (Tu Mu and others say
120). <span lang="zh">𦮼秆</span>, literally, “beanstalks and straw.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 故殺敵者怒也取敵之利者貨也</p>
<p>Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that
there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their
rewards.</p>
<p class="annot">These are two difficult sentences, which I have translated in
accordance with Mei Yao-ch‘ên’s paraphrase. We may incontinently
reject Capt. Calthrop’s extraordinary translation of the first:
“Wantonly to kill and destroy the enemy must be forbidden.” Ts‘ao
Kung quotes a jingle current in his day: <span lang="zh">軍無財士不來軍無賞士不往</span>. Tu
Mu says: “Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see
the advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils
from the enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men
may have a keen desire to fight, each on his own account.” Chang Yü
takes <span lang="zh">利</span> as the direct object of <span lang="zh">取</span>, which is not so good.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 故車戰得車十乘已上賞其先得者而更其旌旗車雜而乘之卒善而養之</p>
<p>Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been
taken, those should be rewarded who took the first.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_16">{16}</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop’s rendering is: “They who are the first to lay
their hands on more than ten of the enemy’s chariots, should be
encouraged.” We should have expected the gallant captain to see
that such Samson-like prowess deserved something more substantial
than mere encouragement. T. omits <span lang="zh">故</span>, and has <span lang="zh">以上</span> in place of the
more archaic <span lang="zh">已上</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the
chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured
soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.</p>

chapter is intended to enforce.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 故知兵之將民之司命國家安危之主也</p>

ATTACK BY STRATAGEM.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1.
孫子曰凡用兵之法全國爲上破國次之全軍爲上破軍次之全旅爲上破旅次之全卒爲上破卒次之
全伍爲上破伍次之</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to
take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it
is not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than
to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire
than to destroy them.</p>
<p class="annot">A <span lang="zh">軍</span> “army corps,” according to Ssŭ-ma Fa, consisted nominally of
12500 men; according to Ts‘ao Kung, a <span lang="zh">旅</span> contained 500 men, a <span lang="zh">卒</span>
any number between 100 and 500, and a <span lang="zh">伍</span> any number between 5 and
100. For the last two, however, Chang Yü gives the exact figures
of 100 and 5 respectively.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 是故百戰百勝非善之善者也不戰而屈人之兵善之善者也</p>
<p>Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme
excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s
resistance without fighting.</p>
<p class="annot">Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the
old Chinese general. Moltke’s greatest triumph, the capitulation
of the huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without
bloodshed.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 故上兵伐謀其次伐交其次伐兵下政攻城</p>
<p>Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy’s plans;</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_18">{18}</p>
<p class="annot">I.e., as Li Ch‘üan says (<span lang="zh">伐其始謀也</span>), in their very inception.
Perhaps the word “baulk” falls short of expressing the full force
of <span lang="zh">伐</span>, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one might
be content to foil the enemy’s stratagems one after another, but
an active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly
in his note: “When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us,
we must anticipate him by delivering our own attack first.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces;</p>
<p class="annot">Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzŭ, in
speaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or
principalities into which the China of his day was split up.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field;</p>
<p class="annot">When he is already in full strength.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.</p>
<p class="annot">The use of the word <span lang="zh">政</span> is somewhat unusual, which may account for
the reading of the modern text: <span lang="zh">其下攻城</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 攻城之法爲不得已修櫓轒轀具器械三月而後成距闉又三月而後已</p>
<p>The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.</p>
<p class="annot">Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon
it in 1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before
Kimberley, Mafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable
that they would have been masters of the situation before the
British were ready seriously to oppose them.</p>
<p>The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements
of war, will take up three whole months;</p>
<p class="annot">It is not quite clear what <span lang="zh">櫓</span> were. Ts‘ao Kung simply defines them
as <span lang="zh">大楯</span> “large shields,” but we get a better idea of them from Li
Ch‘üan, who says they were to protect the heads of those who were
assaulting the city walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest
a sort of Roman <i>testudo</i>, ready made. Tu Mu says they were “what
are now termed <span lang="zh">彭排</span>” (wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks,
according to K‘ang Hsi), but this is denied by Ch‘ên Hao. See
<i>supra</i>, II. 14. The name is also applied to turrets on city
walls. Of <span lang="zh">轒轀</span> (<i>fên yün</i>) we get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">{19}</span> a fairly clear description from
several commentators. They were wooden missile-proof structures on
four wheels, propelled from within, covered over with raw hides,
and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls,
for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth. Tu
Mu adds that they are now called <span lang="zh">木驢</span> “wooden donkeys.” Capt.
Calthrop wrongly translates the term, “battering-rams.” I follow
Ts‘ao Kung in taking <span lang="zh">具</span> as a verb, co-ordinate and synonymous with
<span lang="zh">修</span>. Those commentators who regard <span lang="zh">修</span> as an adjective equivalent to
<span lang="zh">長</span> “long,” make <span lang="zh">具</span> presumably into a noun.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will
take three months more.</p>
<p class="annot">The <span lang="zh">距闉</span> (or <span lang="zh">堙</span>, in the modern text) were great mounds or ramparts
of earth heaped up to the level of the enemy’s walls in order to
discover the weak points in the defence, and also to destroy the
<span lang="zh">樓櫓</span> fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note. Tu Yu
quotes the Tso Chuan: <span lang="zh">楚司馬子反乘堙而窺宋城也</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 將不勝其忿而蟻附之殺士三分之一而城不拔者此攻之災</p>
<p>The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to
the assault like swarming ants,</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop unaccountably omits this vivid simile, which, as
Ts‘ao Kung says, is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants
climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing patience
at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the place
before his engines of war are ready.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while
the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous
effects of a siege.</p>
<p class="annot">We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port
Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record. The
<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> reads <span lang="zh">不勝心之忿</span> ... <span lang="zh">則殺士卒</span> ... <span lang="zh">攻城之災</span>. For <span lang="zh">其忿</span> the
<cite>Yü Lan</cite> has <span lang="zh">心怒</span>. Capt. Calthrop does not translate <span lang="zh">而城不拔者</span>, and
mistranslates <span lang="zh">此攻之災</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 故善用兵者屈人之兵而非戰也拔人之城而非攻也毀人之國而非久也</p>
<p>Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">{20}</span> any
fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he
overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.</p>
<p class="annot">Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the <span lang="zh">國</span>, that is, the
Government, but does no harm to individuals. The classical
instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an end to the Yin
dynasty was acclaimed “Father and mother of the people.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 必以全爭於天下故兵不頓而利可全此謀攻之法也</p>
<p>With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire,
and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.</p>
<p class="annot">Owing to the double meanings of <span lang="zh">兵</span>, <span lang="zh">頓</span> [= <span lang="zh">鈍</span>] and <span lang="zh">利</span>, the latter
part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning:
“And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness
remains perfect.” Chang Yü says that <span lang="zh">利</span> is “the advantage of a
prosperous kingdom and a strong army.”</p>
<p>This is the method of attacking by stratagem.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 故用兵之法十則圍之五則攻之倍則分之</p>
<p>It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to
surround him; if five to one, to attack him;</p>
<p class="annot">Straightaway, without waiting for any further advantage.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.</p>
<p class="annot">Note that <span lang="zh">之</span> does not refer to the enemy, as in the two preceding
clauses. This sudden change of object is quite common in Chinese.
Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed,
it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts‘ao Kung,
however, gives a clue to Sun Tzŭ’s meaning: <span lang="zh">以二敵一則一術爲正一術爲奇</span>
“Being two to the enemy’s one, we may use one part of our army in
the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.” [For
explanation of <span lang="zh">正</span> and <span lang="zh">奇</span>, see V. 3, note.] Chang Yü thus further
elucidates the point: “If our force is twice as numerous as that
of the enemy, it should be split up into two divisions, one to
meet the enemy in front, and one to fall upon his rear; if he
replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed from behind; if
to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front. This is what
is meant by saying that “one part may be used in the regular
way, and the other for some special diversion.” Tu Mu does not
understand that dividing one’s army is simply an irregular, just
as concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is
too hasty in calling this a mistake.”</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_21">{21}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 敵則能戰之少則能逃之不若則能避之</p>
<p>If equally matched, we can offer battle;</p>
<p class="annot">Li Ch‘üan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase:
<span lang="zh">主客力敵惟善者戰</span> “If attackers and attacked are equally matched in
strength, only the able general will fight.” He thus takes <span lang="zh">能</span> as
though it were <span lang="zh">能者</span>, which is awkward.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> has <span lang="zh">守</span> instead of <span lang="zh">逃</span>, which is hardly distinguishable
in sense from <span lang="zh">避</span> in the next clause. The meaning, “we can watch the
enemy,” is certainly a great improvement on the above; but
unfortunately there appears to be no very good authority for the
variant. Chang Yü reminds us that the saying only applies if the
other factors are equal; a small difference in numbers is often
more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 故小敵之堅大敵之擒也</p>
<p>Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the
end it must be captured by the larger force.</p>
<p class="annot">In other words: <span lang="fr">“C’est magnifique; mais ce n’est pas la guerre.”</span></p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 夫將者國之輔也輔周則國必强輔𨻶則國必弱</p>
<p>Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is
complete at all points, the State will be strong; if the bulwark is
defective, the State will be weak.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">𨻶</span> cannot be restricted to anything so particular as in Capt.
Calthrop’s translation, “divided in his allegiance.” It is simply
keeping up the metaphor suggested by <span lang="zh">周</span>. As Li Ch‘üan tersely puts
it: <span lang="zh">𨻶缺也將才不備兵必弱</span> “<i>Ch‘i</i>, gap, indicates deficiency; if the
general’s ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly
versed in his profession), his army will lack strength.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 故君之所以患於軍者三</p>
<p>There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his
army:—</p>

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 不知軍之不可以進而謂之進不知軍之不可以退而謂之退是謂縻軍</p>
<p>(1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of
the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung weakly defines <span lang="zh">縻</span> as <span lang="zh">御</span> “control,” “direct.” Cf. § 17
<i>ad fin</i>. But in reality it is one of those graphic metaphors
which from time to time illuminate Sun Tzŭ’s work, and is rightly
explained by Li Ch‘üan as = <span lang="zh">絆</span>. He adds the comment:
<span lang="zh">如絆驥足無馳驟也</span>. “It is like tying together the legs of a
thoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.” One would naturally
think of “the ruler” in this passage as being at home, and trying
to direct the movements of his army from a distance. But the
commentators understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of
T‘ai Kung: <span lang="zh">國不可以從外治軍不可以從中御</span> “A kingdom should not be
governed from without, an army should not be directed from
within.” Of course it is true that, during an engagement, or when
in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the
thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise,
he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give
wrong orders.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 不知三軍之事而同三軍之政者則軍士惑矣</p>
<p>(2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers
a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.
This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung’s note is: <span lang="zh">軍容不入國國容不入軍禮不可以治兵也</span>, which may be
freely translated: “The military sphere and the civil sphere are
wholly distinct; you can’t handle an army in kid gloves.” And
Chang Yü says: “Humanity and justice (<span lang="zh">仁義</span>) are the principles on
which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and
flexibility (<span lang="zh">權變</span>), on the other hand, are military rather than
civic virtues.” <span lang="zh">同三軍之政</span>, “to assimilate the governing of an
army”—to that of a State, understood. The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has <span lang="zh">欲</span>
inserted before <span lang="zh">同</span>, here and in § 15.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_23">{23}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 不知三軍之權而同三軍之任則軍士疑矣</p>
<p>(3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,</p>
<p class="annot">That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to
circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.</p>
<p class="annot">I follow Mei Yao-ch‘ên here. The other commentators make <span lang="zh">不知</span> etc.
refer, not to the ruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he
employs. Thus Tu Yu says: <span lang="zh">將若不知權變不可付以勢位</span> “If a general is
ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he must not be
entrusted with a position of authority.” Tu Mu quotes <span lang="zh">黃石公</span>: “The
skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man,
the covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in
establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in
action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the
stupid man has no fear of death.” The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> reads <span lang="zh">軍覆疑</span>,
which Tu Yu explains as <span lang="zh">覆敗</span> “is utterly defeated.” Capt. Calthrop
gives a very inaccurate rendering: “Ignorant of the situation of
the army, to interfere in its dispositions.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 三軍既惑且疑則諸侯之難至矣是謂亂軍引勝</p>
<p>But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come
from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into
the army, and flinging victory away.</p>
<p class="annot">Most of the commentators take <span lang="zh">引</span> in the sense of <span lang="zh">奪</span>, which it seems
to bear also in the <cite>Li Chi</cite>, <span lang="zh">玉藻</span>, I. 18. [<span lang="zh">卻</span> is there given as
its equivalent, but Legge tries notwithstanding to retain the more
usual sense, translating “draw ... back,” which is hardly
defensible.] Tu Mu and Wang Hsi, however, think <span lang="zh">引勝</span> means “leading
up to the <em>enemy’s</em> victory.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 故知勝有五知可以戰與不可以戰者勝識衆寡之用者勝上下同欲者勝以虞待不虞者勝
將能而君不御者勝此五者知勝之道也</p>
<p>Thus we may know that there are five essentials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">{24}</span> for victory: (1) He
will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü says: “If he can fight, he advances and takes the
offensive; if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the
defensive. He will invariably conquer who knows whether it is
right to take the offensive or the defensive.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior
forces.</p>
<p class="annot">This is not merely the general’s ability to estimate numbers
correctly, as Li Ch‘üan and others make out. Chang Yü expounds the
saying more satisfactorily: “By applying the art of war, it is
possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. The secret lies in an eye for locality, and in not letting
the right moment slip. Thus Wu Tzŭ says: ‘With a superior force,
make for easy ground; with an inferior one, make for difficult
ground.’”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout
all its ranks.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung refers <span lang="zh">上下</span> less well to sovereign and subjects.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy
unprepared.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with
by the sovereign.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Yu quotes <span lang="zh">王子</span> as saying: <span lang="zh">指授在君決戰在將也</span> “It is the
sovereign’s function to give broad instructions, but to decide on
battle is the function of the general.” It is needless to dilate
on the military disasters which have been caused by undue
interference with operations in the field on the part of the home
government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary
success to the fact that he was not hampered by any central
authority,—that he was, in fact, <span lang="zh">將</span> and <span lang="zh">君</span> in one.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Victory lies in the knowledge of these five points.</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “These five things are knowledge of the principle of
victory.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 故曰知彼知己百戰不殆不知彼而知己一勝一負不知彼不知己每戰必殆</p>
<p>Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need
not fear the result of a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">{25}</span> battles. If you know yourself but not
the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.</p>
<p class="annot">Li Ch‘üan cites the case of <span lang="zh">苻堅</span> Fu Chien, prince of <span lang="zh">秦</span> Ch‘in, who
in 383 A.D. marched with a vast army against the <span lang="zh">晉</span> Chin Emperor.
When warned not to despise an enemy who could command the services
of such men as <span lang="zh">謝安</span> Hsieh An and <span lang="zh">桓沖</span> Huan Ch‘ung, he boastfully
replied: “I have the population of eight provinces at my back,
infantry and horsemen to the number of one million; why, they
could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely throwing their
whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?” Nevertheless,
his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the <span lang="zh">淝</span> Fei River,
and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every
battle.</p>
<p class="annot">The modern text, represented by the <span lang="zh">北堂書鈔</span> and <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, has
<span lang="zh">必敗</span>, which I should be inclined to adopt in preference to <span lang="zh">殆</span> here,
though the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> both have the latter. Chang
Yü offers the best commentary on <span lang="zh">知彼知己</span>. He says that these words
“have reference to attack and defence: knowing the enemy enables
you to take the offensive, knowing yourself enables you to stand
on the defensive.” He adds: <span lang="zh">攻是守之機守是攻之策</span> “Attack is the
secret of defence; defence is the planning of an attack.” It would
be hard to find a better epitome of the root-principle of war.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV. <span lang="zh">形篇</span><br><br>

TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">形 is a very comprehensive and somewhat vague term. Literally,
“form,” “body,” it comes to mean “appearance,” “attitude” or
“disposition;” and here it is best taken as something between, or
perhaps combining, “tactics” and “disposition of troops.” Ts‘ao
Kung explains it as <span lang="zh">軍之形也、我動彼應兩敵相察情也</span> “marching and
counter-marching on the part of the two armies with a view to
discovering each other’s condition.” Tu Mu says: “It is through
the <span lang="zh">形</span> dispositions of an army that its condition may be
discovered. Conceal your dispositions (<span lang="zh">無形</span>), and your condition
will remain secret, which leads to victory; show your
dispositions, and your condition will become patent, which leads
to defeat.” Wang Hsi remarks that the good general can
<span lang="zh">變化其形因敵以制勝</span> “secure success by modifying his tactics to meet
those of the enemy.” In the modern text, the title of the chapter
appears as <span lang="zh">軍形</span>, which Capt. Calthrop incorrectly translates “the
order of battle.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰昔之善戰者先爲不可勝以待敵之可勝</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the
possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating
the enemy.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 不可勝在己可勝在敵</p>
<p>To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the
opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.</p>
<p class="annot">That is, of course, by a mistake on his part. Capt. Calthrop has:
“The causes of defeat come from within; victory is born in the
enemy’s camp,” which, though certainly an improvement on his
previous attempt, is still incorrect.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_27">{27}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 故善戰者能爲不可勝不能使敵必可勝</p>
<p>Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,</p>
<p class="annot">“By concealing the disposition of his troops, covering up his
tracks, and taking unremitting precautions” (Chang Yü).</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text reads <span lang="zh">使敵之可勝</span>, which the modern text has
further modified into <span lang="zh">使敵之必可勝</span>. Capt. Calthrop makes out the
impossible meaning, “and further render the enemy incapable of
victory.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 故曰勝可知而不可爲</p>
<p>Hence the saying: One may <em>know</em> how to conquer without being able to
<em>do</em> it.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop translates: “The conditions necessary for victory
may be present, but they cannot always be obtained,” which is more
or less unintelligible.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 不可勝者守也可勝者攻也</p>
<p>Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat
the enemy means taking the offensive.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">不可勝</span> I retain the sense which it undoubtedly bears in §§ 1–3,
in spite of the fact that the commentators are all against me. The
meaning they give, “He who cannot conquer takes the defensive,” is
plausible enough, but it is highly improbable that <span lang="zh">勝</span> should
suddenly become active in this way. An incorrect variant in the
<cite>Yü Lan</cite> is <span lang="zh">不可勝則守可勝則攻</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 守則不足攻則有餘</p>
<p>Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking,
a superabundance of strength.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 善守者藏於九地之下善攻者動於九天之上故能自保而全勝也</p>
<p>The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret
recesses of the earth;</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “hides under the ninth earth,” which is a metaphor
indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy
may not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">{28}</span> his whereabouts. The <span lang="zh">九地</span> of this passage have of
course no connection with the <span lang="zh">九地</span> “Nine situations” of chap. XI.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of
heaven.</p>
<p class="annot">Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a
thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is
the opinion of most of the commentators, though Ts‘ao Kung,
followed by Tu Yu, explains <span lang="zh">地</span> as the hills, rivers, and other
natural features which will afford shelter or protection to the
attacked, and <span lang="zh">天</span> as the phases of weather which may be turned to
account by the attacking party. Capt. Calthrop’s “The skilful in
attack push to the topmost heaven” conveys no meaning at all.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the
other, a victory that is complete.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop draws on a fertile imagination for the following:
“If these precepts be observed, victory is certain.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 見勝不過衆人之所知非善之善者也</p>
<p>To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is
not the acme of excellence.</p>
<p class="annot">As Ts‘ao Kung remarks, <span lang="zh">當見未萌</span> “the thing is to see the plant
before it has germinated,” to foresee the event before the action
has begun. Li Ch‘üan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when
about to attack the vastly superior army of <span lang="zh">趙</span> Chao, which was
strongly entrenched in the city of <span lang="zh">成安</span> Ch‘êng-an, said to his
officers: “Gentlemen, we are going to annihilate the enemy, and
shall meet again at dinner.” The officers hardly took his words
seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But Han Hsin had
already worked out in his mind the details of a clever stratagem,
whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and
inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary. For the full story,
see <span lang="zh">前漢書</span>, chap. 34, <span lang="zh">韓信傳</span>. Capt. Calthrop again blunders badly
with: “A victory, even if popularly proclaimed as such by the
common folk, may not be a true success.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 戰勝而天下曰善非善之善者也</p>
<p>Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the
whole Empire says, “Well done!”</p>
<p class="annot">True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">陰謀潛運攻心伐謀勝敵之日曾不血刃</span>

<p class="trans_noindent">to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of

<p class="annot">Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick
hearing: <span lang="zh">烏𫉬</span> Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone;
<span lang="zh">離朱</span> Li Chu, who at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects
no bigger than a mustard seed; and <span lang="zh">師曠</span> Shih K‘uang, a blind
musician who could hear the footsteps of a mosquito.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 古之所謂善戰者勝勝易勝者也</p>
<p>What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,
but excels in winning with ease.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text, followed by the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, has <span lang="zh">勝於易勝者也</span>. But
this is an alteration evidently intended to smooth the awkwardness
of <span lang="zh">勝勝易勝者也</span>, which means literally: “one who, conquering, excels
in easy conquering.” Mei Yao-ch‘ên says: “He who only sees the
obvious, wins his battles with difficulty; he who looks below the
surface of things, wins with ease.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 故善戰者之勝也無智名無勇功</p>
<p>Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit
for courage.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu explains this very well: “Inasmuch as his victories are
gained over circumstances that have not come to light, the world
at large knows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for
wisdom; inasmuch as the hostile state submits before there has
been any bloodshed, he receives no credit for courage.”</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_30">{30}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 故其戰勝不忒不忒者其所措必勝勝已敗者也</p>
<p>He wins his battles by making no mistakes.</p>
<p class="annot">Ch‘ên Hao says: “He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no
futile attacks.” The connection of ideas is thus explained by
Chang Yü: “One who seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever
though he may be at winning pitched battles, is also liable on
occasion to be vanquished; whereas he who can look into the future
and discern conditions that are not yet manifest, will never make
a blunder and therefore invariably win.” Li Ch‘üan thinks that the
character <span lang="zh">忒</span> should be <span lang="zh">貳</span> “to have doubts.” But it is better not to
tamper with the text, especially when no improvement in sense is
the result.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for
it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.</p>
<p class="annot">The T‘u Shu omits <span lang="zh">必</span>. <span lang="zh">措</span> is here = <span lang="zh">置</span>. Chia Lin says it is put for
<span lang="zh">錯</span> in the sense of <span lang="zh">雜</span>; but this is far-fetched. Capt. Calthrop
altogether ignores the important word <span lang="zh">忒</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 故善戰者立於不敗之地而不失敵之敗也</p>
<p>Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes
defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">A <span lang="zh">不可爲之計</span> “counsel of perfection,” as Tu Mu truly observes. <span lang="zh">地</span>
need not be confined strictly to the actual ground occupied by the
troops. It includes all the arrangements and preparations which a
wise general will make to increase the safety of his army.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 是故勝兵先勝而後求戰敗兵先戰而後求勝</p>
<p>Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle
after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat
first fights and afterwards looks for victory.</p>
<p class="annot">Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: “In warfare, first lay plans
which will ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if
you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength
alone, victory will no longer be assured.”</p>

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 善用兵者修道而保法故能爲勝敗之政</p>

<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">道</span> and <span lang="zh">法</span>, see <i>supra</i>, I. 4 sqq. I think that Chang Yü is
wrong in altering their signification here, and taking them as
<span lang="zh">爲戰之道</span> and <span lang="zh">制敵之法</span> respectively.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">thus it is in his power to control success.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 兵法一曰度二曰量三曰數四曰稱五曰勝</p>
<p>In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;
secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,
Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 地生度度生量量生數數生稱稱生勝</p>
<p>Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to
Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of
chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.</p>
<p class="annot">It is not easy to distinguish the four terms <span lang="zh">度量數稱</span> very clearly.
The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,
which enable us to <span lang="zh">量</span> form an estimate of the enemy’s strength, and
to <span lang="zh">數</span> make calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are
thus led to <span lang="zh">稱</span> a general weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy’s
chances with our own; if the latter turn the scale, then <span lang="zh">勝</span> victory
ensues. The chief difficulty lies in <span lang="zh">數</span>, which some commentators
take as a calculation of <em>numbers</em>, thereby making it nearly
synonymous with <span lang="zh">量</span>. Perhaps <span lang="zh">量</span> is rather a consideration of the
enemy’s general position or condition (<span lang="zh">情</span> or <span lang="zh">形勢</span>), while <span lang="zh">數</span> is
the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other hand, Tu Mu
defines <span lang="zh">數</span> as <span lang="zh">機數</span>, and adds: <span lang="zh">强弱已定然後能用機變數也</span> “the question
of relative strength having been settled, we can bring the
varied resources of cunning into play.” Ho Shih seconds this
interpretation, which is weakened, however, by the fact that <span lang="zh">稱</span> is
given as logically consequent on <span lang="zh">數</span>; this certainly points to the
latter being a calculation of numbers. Of Capt. Calthrop’s version
the less said the better.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_32">{32}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 故勝兵若以鎰稱銖敗兵若以銖稱鎰</p>
<p>A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight
placed in the scale against a single grain.</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “a victorious army is like an <span lang="zh">鎰</span> <i>i</i> (20 oz.) weighed
against a <span lang="zh">銖</span> <i>shu</i> (1⁄24 oz.); a routed army as a <i>shu</i> weighed
against an <i>i</i>.” The point is simply the enormous advantage which
a disciplined force, flushed with victory, has over one
demoralised by defeat. Legge, in his note on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2,
makes the <span lang="zh">鎰</span> to be 24 Chinese ounces, and corrects Chu Hsi’s
statement that it equalled 20 oz. only. But Li Ch‘üan of the T‘ang
dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 勝者之戰民也若決積水於千仞之谿者形也</p>

<p class="annot">The construction here is slightly awkward and elliptical, but the

ENERGY.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">埶</span> here is said to be an older form of <span lang="zh">勢</span>; Sun Tzŭ, however, would
seem to have used the former in the sense of “power,” and the latter
only in the sense of “circumstances.” The fuller title <span lang="zh">兵勢</span> is found
in the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> and the modern text. Wang Hsi expands it into <span lang="zh">積勢之變</span>
“the application, in various ways, of accumulated power;” and Chang Yü
says: <span lang="zh">兵勢以成然後任勢以取勝</span> “When the soldiers’ energy has reached its
height, it may be used to secure victory.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰凡治衆如治寡分數是也</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same in principle as
the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their
numbers.</p>
<p class="annot">That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with
subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han
Hsin’s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to
him: “How large an army do you think I could lead?” “Not more than
100,000 men, your Majesty.” “And you?” asked the Emperor. “Oh!” he
answered, “the more the better” (<span lang="zh">多多益辦耳</span>). Chang Yü gives the
following curious table of the subdivisions of an army:—5 men make
a <span lang="zh">列</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">列</span> make a <span lang="zh">火</span>; 5 <span lang="zh">火</span> make a <span lang="zh">隊</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">隊</span> make a <span lang="zh">官</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">官</span> make a
<span lang="zh">曲</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">曲</span> make a <span lang="zh">部</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">部</span> make a <span lang="zh">校</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">校</span> make a <span lang="zh">裨</span>; 2 <span lang="zh">裨</span> make a <span lang="zh">軍</span>.
A <span lang="zh">軍</span> or army corps thus works out at 3200 men. But cf. III. § 1,
note. For <span lang="zh">曲</span>, see I. § 10. It is possible that <span lang="zh">官</span> in that paragraph
may also be used in the above technical sense.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 鬥衆如鬥寡形名是也</p>
<p>Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from
fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting
signs and signals.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_34">{34}</p>
<p class="annot">One must be careful to avoid translating <span lang="zh">鬥衆</span> “fighting <em>against</em> a
large number,” no reference to the enemy being intended. <span lang="zh">形</span> is
explained by Ts‘ao Kung as denoting flags and banners, by means of
which every soldier may recognise his own particular regiment or
company, and thus confusion may be prevented. <span lang="zh">名</span> he explains as
drums and gongs, which from the earliest times were used to sound
the advance and the retreat respectively. Tu Mu defines <span lang="zh">形</span> as <span lang="zh">陳形</span>
“marshalling the troops in order,” and takes <span lang="zh">名</span> as the flags and
banners. Wang Hsi also dissents from Ts‘ao Kung, referring <span lang="zh">形</span> to
the ordering of the troops by means of banners, drums and gongs,
and <span lang="zh">名</span> to the various names by which the regiments might be
distinguished. There is much to be said for this view.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 三軍之衆可使必受敵而無敗者奇正是也</p>
<p>To ensure that your whole host may withstand the
brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this
is effected by manœuvres direct and indirect.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">必</span>, there is another reading <span lang="zh">畢</span>, “all together,” adopted by
Wang Hsi and Chang Yü. We now come to one of the most interesting
parts of Sun Tzŭ’s treatise, the discussion of the <span lang="zh">正</span> and the <span lang="zh">奇</span>.
As it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these
two terms, or to render them at all consistently by good English
equivalents, it may be as well to tabulate some of the
commentator’s remarks on the subject before proceeding further. Li
Ch‘üan: <span lang="zh">當敵爲正傍出爲奇</span> “Facing the enemy is <i>chêng</i>, making
lateral diversions is <i>ch‘i</i>.” Chia Lin: <span lang="zh">當敵以正陳取勝以奇兵</span> “In
presence of the enemy, your troops should be arrayed in normal
fashion, but in order to secure victory abnormal manœuvres must be
employed.” Mei Yao-ch‘ên: <span lang="zh">動爲奇靜爲正靜以待之動以勝之</span> “<i>Ch‘i</i> is
active, <i>chêng</i> is passive; passivity means waiting for an
opportunity, activity brings the victory itself.” Ho Shih:
<span lang="zh">我之正使敵視之爲奇我之奇使敵視之爲正正亦爲奇奇亦爲正</span> “We must cause the
enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly
designed, and <i>vice versâ</i>; thus <i>chêng</i> may also be <i>ch‘i</i>, and
<i>ch‘i</i> may also be <i>chêng</i>.” He instances the famous exploit of
Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against <span lang="zh">臨晉</span> Lin-chin (now
<span lang="zh">朝邑</span> Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across the
Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent.
[<i>Ch‘ien Han Shu</i>, ch. 34.] Here, we are told, the march on
Lin-chin was <span lang="zh">正</span>, and the surprise manœuvre was <span lang="zh">奇</span>. Chang Yü gives
the following summary of opinions on the words: “Military writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">{35}</span>
do not all agree with regard to the meaning of <i>ch‘i</i> and <i>chêng</i>.
<span lang="zh">尉繚子</span> Wei Liao Tzŭ [4<sup>th</sup> cent. B.C.] says: <span lang="zh">正兵貴先奇兵貴後</span> ‘Direct
warfare favours frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the
rear.’ Ts‘ao Kung says: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a
direct operation; appearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect
manœuvre.’ <span lang="zh">李衛公</span> Li Wei-kung [6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> cent. A.D.] says: ‘In
war, to march straight ahead is <i>chêng</i>; turning movements, on the
other hand, are <i>ch‘i</i>.’ These writers simply regard <i>chêng</i> as
<i>chêng</i>, and <i>ch‘i</i> as <i>ch‘i</i>; they do not note that the two are
mutually interchangeable and run into each other like the two
sides of a circle [see <i>infra</i>, § 11]. A comment of the T‘ang
Emperor T‘ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: ‘A <i>ch‘i</i>
manœuvre may be <i>chêng</i>, if we make the enemy look upon it as
<i>chêng</i>; then our real attack will be <i>ch‘i</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot
fathom our real intent.’” To put it perhaps a little more clearly:
any attack or other operation is <span lang="zh">正</span>, on which the enemy has had his
attention fixed; whereas that is <span lang="zh">奇</span>, which takes him by surprise or
comes from an unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a
movement which is meant to be <span lang="zh">奇</span>, it immediately becomes <span lang="zh">正</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 兵之所加如以碬投卵者虛實是也</p>
<p>That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against
an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">虛實</span>, literally “the hollow and the solid,” is the title of chap.
VI. <span lang="zh">碫</span> <i>tuan</i> is the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> reading, <span lang="zh">碬</span> <i>hsia</i> that of the
standard text. It appears from K‘ang Hsi that there has been much
confusion between the two characters, and indeed, it is probable
that one of them has really crept into the language as a mistake
for the other.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 凡戰者以正合以奇勝</p>
<p>In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle, but
indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü says: <span lang="zh">徐發奇兵或擣其旁或擊其後</span> “Steadily develop indirect
tactics, either by pounding the enemy’s flanks or falling on his
rear.” A brilliant example of “indirect tactics” which decided the
fortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts’ night march round the
Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote169" id="FNanchor169">[169]</a></p>

indeed, we suppose with <span lang="zh">鄭友賢</span> Chêng Yu-hsien that a clause
relating to it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has
already been pointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven
in all military operations, that they cannot really be considered
apart. Here we simply have an expression, in figurative language,
of the almost infinite resource of a great leader.</p>

<p>In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 奇正相生如循環之無端孰能窮之</p>
<p>The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like

<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> adds <span lang="zh">哉</span>. The final <span lang="zh">之</span> may refer either to the circle

wrong with: “They are a mystery that none can penetrate.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 激水之疾至於漂石者埶也</p>
<p>The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 鷙鳥之疾至於毀折者節也</p>
<p>The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which
enables it to strike and destroy its victim.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">疾</span> the <cite>Yü Lan</cite> reads <span lang="zh">擊</span>, which is also supported by a
quotation in the <span lang="zh">呂氏春秋</span> [3<sup>rd</sup> cent. B.C.]. <span lang="zh">節</span> in this context is a
word which really defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu
Mu says that it is equivalent to <span lang="zh">節量遠近</span> “the measurement or
estimation of distance.” But this meaning does not quite fit the
illustrative simile in § 15. As applied to the falcon, it seems to
me to denote that instinct of <em>self-restraint</em> which keeps the
bird from swooping on its quarry until the right moment, together
with the power of judging when the right moment has arrived. The
analogous quality in soldiers is the highly important one of being
able to reserve their fire until the very instant at which it
will be most effective. When the “Victory” went into action at
Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for several
minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying with
a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close
range, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc
on the enemy’s nearest ships. That was a case of 節.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_38">{38}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 是故善戰者其埶險其節短</p>
<p>Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt
in his decision.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Yu defines <span lang="zh">節</span> here by the word <span lang="zh">斷</span>, which is very like “decision”
in English. <span lang="zh">短</span> is certainly used in a very unusual sense, even if,
as the commentators say, it = <span lang="zh">近</span>. This would have reference to the
measurement of distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get
near before striking. But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzŭ
meant to use the word in a figurative sense comparable to our
own idiom “short and sharp.” Cf. Wang Hsi’s note, which after
describing the falcon’s mode of attack, proceeds: <span lang="zh">兵之乘機當如是耳</span>
“This is just how the ‘psychological moment’ should be seized in
war.” I do not care for Capt. Calthrop’s rendering: “The spirit of
the good fighter is terrifying, his occasions sudden.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 埶如彍弩節如發機</p>
<p>Energy may be likened to the bending of a cross-bow; decision, to the
releasing of the trigger.</p>
<p class="annot">“Energy” seems to be the best equivalent here for <span lang="zh">埶</span>, because the
comparison implies that the force is potential, being stored up in
the bent cross-bow until released by the finger on the trigger.
None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 紛紛紜紜鬥亂而不可亂也渾渾沌沌形圓而不可敗也</p>
<p>Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder
and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array
may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">形圓</span>, literally “formation circular”, is explained by Li Ch‘üan as
<span lang="zh">無向背也</span> “without back or front.” Mei Yao-ch‘ên says: “The
subdivisions of the army having been previously fixed, and the
various signals agreed upon, the separating and joining, the
dispersing and collecting which will take place in the course of a
battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real disorder
is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your
dispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite
out of the question.” It is a little difficult to decide whether
<span lang="zh">鬥亂</span> and <span lang="zh">形圓</span> should not be taken as imperatives: “fight in
disorder (for the purpose of deceiving the enemy), and you will be
secure against real disorder.” Cf. I. § 20: <span lang="zh">亂而取之</span>.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_39">{39}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 亂生於治怯生於勇弱生於彊</p>
<p>Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear
postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.</p>
<p class="annot">In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to
tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts‘ao Kung
throws out a hint of the meaning in his brief note: <span lang="zh">皆毁形匿情也</span>
“These things all serve to destroy formation and conceal one’s
condition.” But Tu Mu is the first to put it quite plainly: “If
you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on, you
must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to display
timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme
courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the
enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 治亂數也勇怯埶也彊弱形也</p>
<p>Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of
subdivision;</p>
<p class="annot">See <i>supra</i>, § 1.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of
latent energy;</p>
<p class="annot">It is passing strange that the commentators should understand <span lang="zh">埶</span>
here as “circumstances”—a totally different sense from that which
it has previously borne in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:
<span lang="zh">見有利之勢而不動敵人以我爲實怯也</span> “seeing that we are favourably
circumstanced and yet make no move, the enemy will believe that we
are really afraid.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical
dispositions.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han
Emperor: “Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to
report on their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned,
carefully concealed all their able-bodied men and well-fed horses,
and only allowed infirm soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen.
The result was that the spies one and all recommended the Emperor
to deliver his attack.” <span lang="zh">婁敬</span> Lou Ching alone opposed them, saying:
“When two countries go to war, they are naturally inclined to make
an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our spies have seen
nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some <i>ruse</i> on
the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to attack.”
The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the trap
and found himself surrounded at <span lang="zh">白登</span> Po-têng.”</p>

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 故善動敵者形之敵必從之予之敵必取之</p>
<p>Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains
deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung’s note is <span lang="zh">見羸形也</span> “Make a display of weakness and
want,” but Tu Mu rightly points out that <span lang="zh">形</span> does not refer only to
weakness: “If our force happens to be superior to the enemy’s,
weakness may be simulated in order to lure him on; but if
inferior, he must be led to believe that we are strong, in order
that he may keep off. In fact, all the enemy’s movements should be
determined by the signs that we choose to give him.” The following
anecdote of <span lang="zh">孫臏</span> Sun Pin, a descendant of Sun Wu, is related at
length in the <span lang="zh">史記</span>, chap. 65: In 341 B.C., the <span lang="zh">齊</span> Ch‘i State being
at war with <span lang="zh">魏</span> Wei, sent <span lang="zh">田忌</span> T‘ien Chi and Sun Pin against the
general <span lang="zh">龐涓</span> P‘ang Chüan, who happened to be a deadly personal
enemy of the latter. Sun Pin said: “The Ch‘i State has a
reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary despises us.
Let us turn this circumstance to account.” Accordingly, when the
army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders to
show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the
night after only 20,000. P‘ang Chüan pursued them hotly, saying to
himself: “I knew these men of Ch‘i were cowards: their numbers
have already fallen away by more than half.” In his retreat, Sun
Pin came to a narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers
would reach after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark,
and inscribed upon it the words: “Under this tree shall P‘ang
Chüan die.” Then, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body
of archers in ambush near by, with orders to shoot directly they
saw a light. Later on, P‘ang Chüan arrived at the spot, and
noticing the tree, struck a light in order to read what was
written on it. His body was immediately riddled by a volley of
arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The above is Tu
Mu’s version of the story; the <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, less dramatically but
probably with more historical truth, makes P‘ang Chüan cut his own
throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.]</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">予</span> here = <span lang="zh">與</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 以利動之以卒待之</p>
<p>By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of
picked men he lies in wait for him.</p>
<p class="annot">This would appear to be the meaning if we retain <span lang="zh">卒</span>, which Mei
Yao-ch‘ên explains as <span lang="zh">精卒</span> “men of spirit.” The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> reads <span lang="zh">本</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">{41}</span>
an emendation suggested by <span lang="zh">李靖</span> Li Ching. The meaning then would
be, “He lies in wait with the main body of his troops.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">21. 故善戰者求之於埶不責於人故能擇人而任埶</p>
<p>The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does
not require too much from individuals.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says: “He first of all considers the power of his army in
the bulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and
uses each man according to his capabilities. He does not demand
perfection from the untalented.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilise combined
energy.</p>
<p class="annot">Another reading has <span lang="zh">之</span> instead of <span lang="zh">埶</span>. It would be interesting if
Capt. Calthrop could tell us where the following occurs in the
Chinese: “yet, when an opening or advantage shows, he pushes it to
its limits.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">22. 任埶者其戰人也如轉木石木石之性安則靜危則動方則止圓則行</p>
<p>When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it were
like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or
stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a
slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,
to go rolling down.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung calls this <span lang="zh">任自然勢</span> “the use of natural or inherent
power.” Capt. Calthrop ignores the last part of the sentence
entirely. In its stead he has: “So await the opportunity, and so
act when the opportunity arrives”—another absolutely gratuitous
interpolation. The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> omits <span lang="zh">任</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">23. 故善戰人之埶如轉圓石於千仞之山者埶也</p>
<p>Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a
round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So
much on the subject of energy.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> omits <span lang="zh">善</span>. The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu
Mu’s opinion, is the paramount importance in war of rapid
evolutions and sudden rushes. “Great results,” he adds, “can thus
be achieved with small forces.”</p>

WEAK POINTS AND STRONG.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:
“Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive
and the defensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and
indirect methods. The good general acquaints himself first with
the theory of attack and defence, and then turns his attention to
direct and indirect methods. He studies the art of varying and
combining these two methods before proceeding to the subject of
weak and strong points. For the use of direct or indirect methods
arises out of attack and defence, and the perception of weak and
strong points depends again on the above methods. Hence the
present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on Energy.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰凡先處戰地而待敵者佚後處戰地而趨戰者勞</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of
the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field
and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.</p>
<p class="annot">Instead of <span lang="zh">處</span>, the <cite>Yü Lan</cite> has in both clauses the stronger word
<span lang="zh">據</span>. For the antithesis between <span lang="zh">佚</span> and <span lang="zh">勞</span>, cf. I. § 23, where
however <span lang="zh">勞</span> is used as a verb.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 故善戰者致人而不致於人</p>
<p>Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does
not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.</p>
<p class="annot">The next paragraph makes it clear that <span lang="zh">致</span> does not merely mean, as
Tu Mu says, <span lang="zh">令敵來就我</span> “to make the enemy approach me,” but rather
to make him go in any direction I please. It is thus practically
synonymous with <span lang="zh">制</span>. Cf. Tu Mu’s own note on V. § 19. One mark of a
great soldier is that he fights on his own terms or fights not at
all.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote170" id="FNanchor170">[170]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_43">{43}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 能使敵人自至者利之也能使敵人不得至者害之也</p>
<p>By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach
of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible
for the enemy to draw near.</p>
<p class="annot">In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second,
he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have
to defend.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 故敵佚能勞之飽能飢之安能動之</p>
<p>If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;</p>
<p class="annot">This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao-Ch‘ên’s
interpretation of I. § 23.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">if well supplied with food, he can starve him out;</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">飢</span> is probably an older form than <span lang="zh">饑</span>, the reading of the original
text. Both are given in the <span lang="zh">說文</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.</p>
<p class="annot">The subject to <span lang="zh">能</span> is still <span lang="zh">善戰者</span>; but these clauses would read
better as direct admonitions, and in the next sentence we find Sun
Tzŭ dropping insensibly into the imperative.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 出其所必趨趨其所不意</p>
<p>Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly
to places where you are not expected.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text, adopted by the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, has <span lang="zh">出其所不趨</span>; it has
been altered to suit the context and the commentaries of Ts‘ao
Kung and Ho Shih, who evidently read <span lang="zh">必趨</span>. The other reading would
mean: “Appear at points to which the enemy cannot hasten;” but in
this case there is something awkward in the use of <span lang="zh">趨</span>. Capt.
Calthrop is wrong of course with “appearing where the enemy is not.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 行千里而不勞者行於無人之地也</p>
<p>An army may march great distances without distress,
if it marches through country where the enemy is not.</p>
<p class="annot">We must beware of understanding <span lang="zh">無人之地</span> as “uninhabited country.”
Sun Tzŭ habitually uses <span lang="zh">人</span> in the sense of <span lang="zh">敵</span>, e.g. <i>supra</i>, § 2.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">{44}</span>
Ts‘ao Kung sums up very well: <span lang="zh">出空擊虛避其所守擊其不意</span> “Emerge from
the void [<i>q.d.</i> like “a bolt from the blue”], strike at
vulnerable points, shun places that are defended, attack in
unexpected quarters.” The difference of meaning between <span lang="zh">空</span> and <span lang="zh">虛</span>
is worth noting.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 攻而必取者攻其所不守也守而必固者守其所不攻也</p>
<p>You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack
places which are undefended.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">所不守</span> is of course hyperbolical; Wang Hsi rightly explains it as “weak
points; that is to say, where the general is lacking in capacity, or
the soldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the
precautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late, or
provisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst
themselves.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">You can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions
that cannot be attacked.</p>
<p class="annot"><i>I.e.</i>, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There
is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this latter
clause. Tu Mu, Ch‘ên Hao, and Mei Yao-ch‘ên assume the meaning to be:
“In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend even those
places that are not likely to be attacked;” and Tu Mu adds: “How much
more, then, those that will be attacked.” Taken thus, however, the
clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in
the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang
Yü, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: “He who is
skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven
[see IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against
him. This being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those
that the enemy cannot defend ... He who is skilled in defence hides in
the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the
enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I
shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 故善攻者敵不知其所守善守者敵不知其所攻</p>
<p>Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know
what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not
know what to attack.</p>
<p class="annot">An aphorism which puts the whole art of war into a nutshell.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_45">{45}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 微乎微乎至於無形神乎神乎至於無聲故能爲敵之司命</p>
<p>O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be
invisible, through you inaudible;</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “without form or sound,” but it is said of course with
reference to the enemy. Chang Yü, whom I follow, draws no sharp
distinction between <span lang="zh">微</span> and <span lang="zh">神</span>, but Tu Mu and others think that <span lang="zh">微</span>
indicates the secrecy to be observed on the defensive, and <span lang="zh">神</span> the
rapidity to be displayed in attack. The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> text differs
considerably from ours, reading: <span lang="zh">微乎微乎故能隱於常形神乎神乎故能爲敵司命</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has <span lang="zh">故能爲變化司命</span>. Capt. Calthrop’s version of
this paragraph is so remarkable that I cannot refrain from quoting
it in full: “Now the secrets of the art of offence are not to be
easily apprehended, as a certain shape or noise can be understood,
of the senses; but when these secrets are once learnt, the enemy
is mastered.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 進而不可禦者衝其虛也退而不可追者速而不可及也</p>
<p>You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the
enemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your
movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">The second member of the sentence is weak, because <span lang="zh">不可及</span> is nearly
tautologous with <span lang="zh">不可追</span>. The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> reads <span lang="zh">遠</span> for <span lang="zh">速</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 故我欲戰敵雖高壘深溝不得不與我戰者攻其所必救也</p>
<p>If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even
though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we
need do is to attack some other place that he will be obliged to
relieve.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says: “If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his
line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have
to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack
against the sovereign himself.” It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike
certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal
attacks.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_46">{46}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 我不欲戰畫地而守之敵不得與我戰者乖其所之也</p>
<p>If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us
even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the
ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in
his way.</p>
<p class="annot">In order to preserve the parallelism with § 11, I should prefer to
follow the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> text, which inserts <span lang="zh">雖</span> before <span lang="zh">畫地</span>. This
extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia
Lin: <span lang="zh">雖未修壘壍</span> “even though we have constructed neither wall nor
ditch.” The real crux of the passage lies in <span lang="zh">乖其所之也</span>. <span lang="zh">之</span> of
course = <span lang="zh">至</span>. Ts‘ao Kung defines <span lang="zh">乖</span> by the word <span lang="zh">戾</span>, which is perhaps
a case of <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>. Li Ch‘üan, however, says:
<span lang="zh">設奇異而疑之</span> “we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;”
and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative
anecdotes—one of <span lang="zh">諸葛亮</span> Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying <span lang="zh">陽平</span>
Yang-p‘ing and about to be attacked by <span lang="zh">司馬懿</span> Ssŭ-ma I, suddenly
struck his colours, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung
open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping
and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the
intended effect; for Ssŭ-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew
off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here,
therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of
“bluff.” Capt. Calthrop translates: “and prevent the enemy from
attacking by keeping him in suspense,” which shows that he has not
fully grasped the meaning of <span lang="zh">乖</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 故形人而我無形則我專而敵分</p>
<p>By discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible
ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must
be divided.</p>
<p class="annot">The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yü (after
Mei Yao-ch‘ên) rightly explains it thus: “If the enemy’s
dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body;
whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be
obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from
every quarter.” <span lang="zh">形</span> is here used as an active verb: “to make to
appear.” See IV, note on heading. Capt. Calthrop’s “making feints”
is quite wrong.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_47">{47}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 我專爲一敵分爲十是以十共其一也則我衆而敵寡</p>
<p>We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into
fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts
of a whole,</p>
<p class="annot">The original text has <span lang="zh">以敵攻其一也</span>, which in accordance with the
<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> has been altered as above. I adopt the
more plausible reading of the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>: <span lang="zh">是以十攻其一也</span>, in spite of
having to refer <span lang="zh">十</span> to ourselves and not to the enemy. Thus Tu Yu
and Mei Yao-ch‘ên both regard <span lang="zh">十</span> as the undivided force, consisting
of so many parts, and <span lang="zh">一</span> as each of the isolated fractions of the
enemy. The alteration of <span lang="zh">攻</span> into <span lang="zh">共</span> can hardly be right, though the
true text might conceivably have been <span lang="zh">是以十共攻其一也</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 能以衆擊寡者則吾之所與戰者約矣</p>
<p>And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior
one, our opponents will be in dire straits.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">擊</span>, the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> have <span lang="zh">敵</span>. Tu Yu, followed by
the other commentators, arbitrarily defines <span lang="zh">約</span> as <span lang="zh">少而易勝</span> “few and
easy to conquer,” but only succeeds thereby in making the sentence
absolutely pointless. As for Capt. Calthrop’s translation: “In
superiority of numbers there is economy of strength,” its meaning
is probably known to himself alone. In justification of my own
rendering of <span lang="zh">約</span>, I would refer to <cite>Lun Yü</cite> IV. 2 and VII. 25 (3).</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 吾所與戰之地不可知不可知則敵所備者多敵所備者多則吾所與戰者寡矣</p>
<p>The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the
enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several
different points;</p>
<p class="annot">Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by
saying that “while his opponents were kept fully employed
wondering what he was going to do, <em>he</em> was thinking most of what
he was going to do himself.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers
we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_48">{48}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 故備前則後寡備後則前寡備左則右寡備右則左寡無所不備則無所不寡</p>
<p>For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;
should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he
strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen
his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements
everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.</p>
<p class="annot">In Frederick the Great’s <cite>Instructions to his Generals</cite> we read:
“A defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment.
Those generals who have had but little experience attempt to
protect every point, while those who are better acquainted with
their profession, having only the capital object in view, guard
against a decisive blow, and acquiesce in smaller misfortunes to
avoid greater.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 寡者備人者也衆者使人備己者也</p>
<p>Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible
attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make
these preparations against us.</p>
<p class="annot">The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson’s words, is “to compel
the enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior
force against each fraction in turn.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 故知戰之地知戰之日則可千里而會戰</p>
<p>Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may
concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.</p>
<p class="annot">There is nothing about “defeating” anybody in this sentence, as
Capt. Calthrop translates. What Sun Tzŭ evidently has in mind is
that nice calculation of distances and that masterly employment of
strategy which enable a general to divide his army for the purpose
of a long and rapid march, and afterwards to effect a junction at
precisely the right spot and the right hour in order to confront
the enemy in overwhelming strength. Among many such successful
junctions which military history records, one of the most dramatic
and decisive was the appearance of Blücher just at the critical
moment on the field of Waterloo.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_49">{49}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 不知戰地不知戰日則左不能救右右不能救左前不能救後後不能救前而況遠者數十里近者數里乎</p>
<p>But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be
impotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour
the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support
the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are
anything under a hundred <i>li</i> apart, and even the nearest are
separated by several <i>li</i>!</p>
<p class="annot">The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in
precision, but the mental picture we are required to draw is
probably that of an army advancing towards a given rendezvous in
separate columns, each of which has orders to be there on a fixed
date. If the general allows the various detachments to proceed at
haphazard, without precise instructions as to the time and place
of meeting, the enemy will be able to annihilate the army in
detail. Chang Yü’s note may be worth quoting here: “If we do not
know the place where our opponents mean to concentrate or the
day on which they will join battle, our unity will be forfeited
through our preparations for defence, and the positions we hold
will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we
shall be brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no
mutual support will be possible between wings, vanguard or rear,
especially if there is any great distance between the foremost
and hindmost divisions of the army.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">21. 以吾度之越人之兵雖多亦奚益於勝敗哉故曰勝可爲也</p>
<p>Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own in
number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop omits <span lang="zh">以吾度之</span>, and his translation of the remainder
is flabby and inaccurate. As Sun Tzŭ was in the service of the <span lang="zh">吳</span>
Wu State, it has been proposed to read <span lang="zh">吳</span> instead of <span lang="zh">吾</span>—a wholly
unnecessary tampering with the text. Yüeh coincided roughly with
the present province of Chehkiang. Li Ch‘üan very strangely takes
<span lang="zh">越</span> not as the proper name, but in the sense of <span lang="zh">過</span> “to surpass.” No
other commentator follows him. <span lang="zh">勝敗</span> belongs to the class of
expressions like <span lang="zh">遠近</span> “distance,” <span lang="zh">大小</span> “magnitude,” etc., to which
the Chinese have to resort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">{50}</span> in order to express abstract ideas of
degree. The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, however, omits <span lang="zh">敗</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">I say then that victory can be achieved.</p>
<p class="annot">Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states
ended in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by <span lang="zh">勾踐</span> Kou Chien and
its incorporation in Yüeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzŭ’s
death. With his present assertion compare IV. § 4: <span lang="zh">勝可知而不可爲</span>
(which is the obviously mistaken reading of the <cite>Yü Lan</cite> here).
Chang Yü is the only one to point out the seeming discrepancy,
which he thus goes on to explain: “In the chapter on Tactical
Dispositions it is said, ‘One may <em>know</em> how to conquer without
being able to <em>do</em> it,’ whereas here we have the statement that
‘victory can be achieved.’ The explanation is, that in the former
chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under discussion,
it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot make
certain of beating him. But the present passage refers
particularly to the soldiers of Yüeh who, according to Sun Tzŭ’s
calculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of
the impending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can
be achieved.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">22. 敵雖衆可使無鬥故策之而知得失之計</p>
<p>Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from
fighting.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop quite unwarrantably translates: “<em>If</em> the enemy be
many in number, prevent him,” etc.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of
their success.</p>
<p class="annot">This is the first of four similarly constructed sentences, all of
which present decided difficulties. Chang Yü explains <span lang="zh">知得失之計</span> as
<span lang="zh">知其計之得失</span>. This is perhaps the best way of taking the words,
though Chia Lin, referring <span lang="zh">計</span> to ourselves and not the enemy,
offers the alternative of <span lang="zh">我得彼失之計皆先知也</span> “Know beforehand all
plans conducive to our success and to the enemy’s failure.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">23. 作之而知動靜之理形之而知死生之地</p>
<p>Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.</p>
<p class="annot">Instead of <span lang="zh">作</span>, the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>, <cite>Yü Lan</cite>, and also Li Ch‘üan’s
text have <span lang="zh">候</span>, which the latter explains as “the observation of
omens,” and Chia Lin simply as “watching and waiting.” <span lang="zh">作</span> is
defined by Tu Mu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">{51}</span> as <span lang="zh">激作</span>, and Chang Yü tells us that by noting the
joy or anger shown by the enemy on being thus disturbed, we shall
be able to conclude whether his policy is to lie low or the
reverse. He instances the action of Chu-ko Liang, who sent the
scornful present of a woman’s head-dress to Ssŭ-ma I, in order to
goad him out of his Fabian tactics.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.</p>
<p class="annot">Two commentators, Li Ch‘üan and Chang Yü, take <span lang="zh">形之</span> in the sense
of <span lang="zh">示之</span> “put on specious appearances.” The former says: “You may
either deceive the enemy by a show of weakness—striking your
colours and silencing your drums; or by a show of strength—making
a hollow display of camp-fires and regimental banners.” And the
latter quotes V. 19, where <span lang="zh">形之</span> certainly seems to bear this sense.
On the other hand, I would point to § 13 of this chapter, where <span lang="zh">形</span>
must with equal certainty be active. It is hard to choose between
the two interpretations, but the context here agrees better, I
think, with the one that I have adopted. Another difficulty arises
over <span lang="zh">死生之地</span>, which most of the commentators, thinking no doubt of
the <span lang="zh">死地</span> in XI. § 1, refer to the actual <em>ground</em> on which the
enemy is encamped. The notes of Chia Lin and Mei Yao-ch‘ên,
however, seem to favour my view. The same phrase has a somewhat
different meaning in I. § 2.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">24. 角之而知有餘不足之處</p>
<p>Carefully compare the opposing army with your own,</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Yu is right, I think, in attributing this force to <span lang="zh">角</span>; Ts‘ao
Kung defines it simply as <span lang="zh">量</span>. Capt. Calthrop surpasses himself with
the staggering translation “Flap the wings”! Can the Latin <i>cornu</i>
(in its figurative sense) have been at the back of his mind?</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is
deficient.</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. IV. § 6.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">25. 故形兵之極至於無形無形則深閒不能窺知者不能謀</p>
<p>In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is
to conceal them;</p>
<p class="annot">The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. <span lang="zh">無形</span> is
perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see <i>supra</i>, § 9) as
“showing no sign” of what you mean to do, of the plans that are
formed in your brain.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_52">{52}</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the
subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">深閒</span> is expanded by Tu Mu into <span lang="zh">雖有閒者深來窺我</span>. [For <span lang="zh">閒</span>, see XIII,
note on heading.] He explains <span lang="zh">知者</span> in like fashion:
<span lang="zh">雖有智能之士亦不能謀我也</span> “though the enemy may have clever and
capable officers, they will not be able to lay any plans against
us.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">26. 因形而錯勝於衆衆不能知</p>
<p>How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy’s own
tactics—that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="annot">All the commentators except Li Ch‘üan make <span lang="zh">形</span> refer to the enemy.
So Ts‘ao Kung: <span lang="zh">因敵形而立勝</span>. <span lang="zh">錯</span> is defined as <span lang="zh">置</span>. The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> has
<span lang="zh">措</span>, with the same meaning. See IV. § 13. The <cite>Yü Lan</cite> reads <span lang="zh">作</span>,
evidently a gloss.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">27. 人皆知我所以勝之形而莫知吾所以制勝之形</p>
<p>All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see
is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.</p>
<p class="annot"><i>I.e.</i>, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what
they cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which
has preceded the battle. It seems justifiable, then, to render the
first <span lang="zh">形</span> by “tactics” and the second by “strategy.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">28. 故其戰勝不復而應形於無窮</p>
<p>Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let
your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.</p>
<p class="annot">As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: “There is but one root-principle (<span lang="zh">理</span>)
underlying victory, but the tactics (<span lang="zh">形</span>) which lead up to it are
infinite in number.” With this compare Col. Henderson; “The rules
of strategy are few and simple. They may be learned in a week.
They may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams.
But such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an army like
Napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to write like
Gibbon.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII. <span lang="zh">軍爭篇</span><br><br>

MANŒUVRING.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">The commentators, as well as the subsequent text, make it clear
that this is the real meaning of <span lang="zh">軍爭</span>. Thus, Li Ch‘üan says that <span lang="zh">爭</span>
means <span lang="zh">趨利</span> “marching rapidly to seize an advantage”; Wang Hsi
says: <span lang="zh">爭者爭利得利則勝</span> “‘Striving’ means striving for an advantage;
this being obtained, victory will follow;” and Chang Yü:
<span lang="zh">兩軍相對而爭利也</span> “The two armies face to face, and each striving to
obtain a tactical advantage over the other.” According to the
latter commentator, then, the situation is analogous to that of
two wrestlers manœuvring for a “hold,” before coming to actual
grips. In any case, we must beware of translating <span lang="zh">爭</span> by the word
“fighting” or “battle,” as if it were equivalent to <span lang="zh">戰</span>. Capt.
Calthrop falls into this mistake.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰凡用兵之法將受命於君</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the
sovereign.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">君</span> there is another reading <span lang="zh">天</span>, which Li Ch‘üan explains as
<span lang="zh">恭行天罰</span> “being the reverent instrument of Heaven’s chastisement.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 合軍聚衆交和而舍</p>
<p>Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend
and harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung takes <span lang="zh">和</span> as referring to the <span lang="zh">和門</span> or main gate of the
military camp. This, Tu Mu tells us, was formed with a couple of
flags hung across. [Cf. <cite>Chou Li</cite>, ch. xxvii. fol. 31 of the
Imperial edition: <span lang="zh">直旌門</span>.] <span lang="zh">交和</span> would then mean “setting up his <span lang="zh">和門</span>
opposite that of the enemy.” But Chia Lin’s explanation, which has
been adopted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">{56}</span> above, is on the whole simpler and better. Chang Yü,
while following Ts‘ao Kung, adds that the words may also be taken
to mean “the establishment of harmony and confidence between the
higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;” and he
quotes a saying of Wu Tzŭ (chap. 1 <i>ad init.</i>): “Without harmony
in the State, no military expedition can be undertaken; without
harmony in the army, no battle array can be formed.” In the
historical romance <span lang="zh">東周列國</span>, chap. 75, Sun Tzŭ himself is
represented as saying to <span lang="zh">伍員</span> Wu Yüan: <span lang="zh">大凡行兵之法先除內患然後方可外征</span>
“As a general rule, those who are waging war should get rid of all
domestic troubles before proceeding to attack the external foe.” <span lang="zh">舍</span>
is defined as <span lang="zh">止</span>. It here conveys the notion of encamping after
having taken the field.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 莫難於軍爭軍爭之難者以迂爲直以患爲利</p>
<p>After that, comes tactical manœuvring, than which there is nothing
more difficult.</p>
<p class="annot">I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of
Ts‘ao Kung, who says: <span lang="zh">從始受命至於交和軍爭難也</span> “From the time of
receiving the sovereign’s instructions until our encampment over
against the enemy, the tactics to be pursued are most difficult.”
It seems to me that the <span lang="zh">軍爭</span> tactics or manœuvres can hardly be
said to begin until the army has sallied forth and encamped,
and Ch‘ên Hao’s note gives colour to this view: “For levying,
concentrating, harmonising and intrenching an army, there are
plenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes
when we engage in tactical operations.” Tu Yu also observes that
“the great difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in
seizing favourable positions.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">The difficulty of tactical manœuvring consists in turning the devious
into the direct, and misfortune into gain.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">以迂爲直</span> is one of those highly condensed and somewhat enigmatical
expressions of which Sun Tzŭ is so fond. This is how it is
explained by Ts‘ao Kung: <span lang="zh">示以遠速其道里先敵至也</span> “Make it appear that
you are a long way off, then cover the distance rapidly and arrive
on the scene before your opponent.” Tu Mu says: “Hoodwink the
enemy, so that he may be remiss and leisurely while you are
dashing along with the utmost speed.” Ho Shih gives a slightly
different turn to the sentence: “Although you may have difficult
ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter, this is a
drawback which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">{57}</span> can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of
movement.” Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two
famous passages across the Alps—that of Hannibal, which laid Italy
at his mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which
resulted in the great victory of Marengo.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 故迂其途而誘之以利後人發先人至此知迂直之計者也</p>
<p>Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy
out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach
the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of <em>deviation</em>.</p>
<p class="annot">Chia Lin understands <span lang="zh">途</span> as the <em>enemy’s</em> line of march, thus: “If
our adversary’s course is really a short one, and we can manage to
divert him from it (<span lang="zh">迂之</span>) either by simulating weakness or by
holding out some small advantage, we shall be able to beat him in
the race for good positions.” This is quite a defensible view,
though not adopted by any other commentator. <span lang="zh">人</span> of course = <span lang="zh">敵</span>,
and <span lang="zh">後</span> and <span lang="zh">先</span> are to be taken as verbs. Tu Mu cites the famous
march of <span lang="zh">趙奢</span> Chao Shê in 270 B.C. to relieve the town of <span lang="zh">閼與</span>
O-yü, which was closely invested by a <span lang="zh">秦</span> Ch‘in army. [It should be
noted that the above is the correct pronunciation of <span lang="zh">閼與</span>, as given
in the commentary on the <cite>Ch‘ien Han Shu</cite>, ch. 34. Giles’
dictionary gives “Yü-yü,” and Chavannes, I know not on what
authority, prefers to write “Yen-yü.” The name is omitted
altogether from Playfair’s “Cities and Towns.”] The King of Chao
first consulted <span lang="zh">廉頗</span> Lien P‘o on the advisability of attempting a
relief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the
intervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then
turned to Chao Shê, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the
march, but finally said: “We shall be like two rats fighting in a
hole—and the pluckier one will win!” So he left the capital with
his army, but had only gone a distance of 30 <i>li</i> when he stopped
and began throwing up intrenchments. For 28 days he continued
strengthening his fortifications, and took care that spies should
carry the intelligence to the enemy. The Ch‘in general was
overjoyed, and attributed his adversary’s tardiness to the fact
that the beleaguered city was in the Han State, and thus not
actually part of Chao territory. But the spies had no sooner
departed than Chao Shê began a forced march lasting for two days
and one night, and arrived on the scene of action with such
astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding
position on the <span lang="zh">北山</span> “North hill” before the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">{58}</span> had got wind of
his movements. A crushing defeat followed for the Ch‘in forces,
who were obliged to raise the siege of O-yü in all haste and
retreat across the border. [See <span lang="zh">史記</span>, chap. 81.]</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 故軍爭爲利衆爭爲危</p>
<p>Manœuvring with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined
multitude, most dangerous.</p>
<p class="annot">I here adopt the reading of the T‘ung Tien, Chêng Yu-hsien and the
<cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, where <span lang="zh">衆</span> appears to supply the exact <i>nuance</i> required
in order to make sense. The standard text, on the other hand, in
which <span lang="zh">軍</span> is repeated, seems somewhat pointless. The commentators
take it to mean that manœuvres may be profitable, or they may be
dangerous: it all depends on the ability of the general. Capt.
Calthrop translates <span lang="zh">衆爭</span> “the wrangles of a multitude”!</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 舉軍而爭利則不及委軍而爭利則輜重捐</p>
<p>If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an
advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text has <span lang="zh">故</span> instead of <span lang="zh">舉</span>; but a verb is needed to
balance <span lang="zh">委</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves
the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">委軍</span> is evidently unintelligible to the Chinese commentators, who
paraphrase the sentence as though it began with <span lang="zh">棄輜</span>. Absolute
tautology in the apodosis can then only be avoided by drawing an
impossibly fine distinction between <span lang="zh">棄</span> and <span lang="zh">捐</span>. I submit my own
rendering without much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is
some deep-seated corruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear
that Sun Tzŭ does not approve of a lengthy march being undertaken
without supplies. Cf. <i>infra</i>, § 11.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 是故卷甲而趨日夜不處倍道兼行百里而爭利則擒三將軍</p>
<p>Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats,</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">卷甲</span> does not mean “to discard one’s armour,” as Capt. Calthrop
translates, but implies on the contrary that it is to be carried
with you. Chang Yü says: <span lang="zh">猶悉甲也</span> “This means, in full panoply.”</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_59">{59}</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double
the usual distance at a stretch,</p>
<p class="annot">The ordinary day’s march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 <i>li</i>; but on one
occasion, when pursuing <span lang="zh">劉備</span> Liu Pei, Ts‘ao Ts‘ao is said to have
covered the incredible distance of 300 <i>li</i> within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">doing a hundred <i>li</i> in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of
all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 勁者先罷者後其法十一而至</p>
<p>The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,
and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">罷</span>, see II. § 14. The moral is, as Ts‘ao Kung and others point
out: Don’t march a hundred <i>li</i> to gain a tactical advantage,
either with or without impedimenta. Manœuvres of this description
should be confined to short distances. Stonewall Jackson said:
“The hardships of forced marches are often more painful than the
dangers of battle.” He did not often call upon his troops for
extraordinary exertions. It was only when he intended a surprise,
or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he sacrificed
everything to speed.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote171" id="FNanchor171">[171]</a></p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 五十里而爭利則蹶上將軍其法半至</p>
<p>If you march fifty <i>li</i> in order to outmanœuvre the enemy, you will
lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will

<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">蹶</span> is explained as similar in meaning to <span lang="zh">挫</span>: literally, “the leader
of the first division will be <em>torn away</em>.” Cf. Tso Chuan, <span lang="zh">襄</span> 19<sup>th</sup>

<span lang="zh">薪鹽蔬材之屬</span> “fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.” But I think what Sun Tzŭ
meant was “stores accumulated in dépôts,” as distinguished from
<span lang="zh">輜重</span> and <span lang="zh">糧食</span>, the various impedimenta accompanying an army on its
march. Cf. <cite>Chou Li</cite>, ch. xvi. fol. 10: <span lang="zh">委人</span> ... <span lang="zh">斂薪芻凡疏材木材凡畜聚之物</span>.</p>

<p class="annot">The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only
swift but, as Mei Yao-ch‘ên points out, <span lang="zh">無形跡</span> “invisible and
leaves no tracks.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">your compactness that of the forest.</p>
<p class="annot">It is hardly possible to take <span lang="zh">徐</span> here in its ordinary sense of
“sedate,” as Tu Yu tries to do. Mêng Shih comes nearer the mark in
his note <span lang="zh">緩行須有行列</span> “When slowly marching, order and ranks must be
preserved”—so as to guard against surprise attacks. But natural
forests do not grow in rows, whereas they do generally possess the
quality of density or compactness. I think then that Mei Yao-ch‘ên
uses the right adjective in saying <span lang="zh">如林之森然</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 侵掠如火不動如山</p>
<p>In raiding and plundering be like fire,</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. <cite>Shih Ching</cite>, IV. 3. iv. 6: <span lang="zh">如火烈烈則莫我敢曷</span> “Fierce as a
blazing fire which no man can check.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">in immovability like a mountain.</p>
<p class="annot">That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to
dislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to
entice you into a trap.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_62">{62}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 難知如陰動如雷霆</p>
<p>Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move,
fall like a thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text has <span lang="zh">震</span> instead of <span lang="zh">霆</span>. Cf. IV. § 7. Tu Yu quotes a
saying of T‘ai Kung which has passed into a proverb:
<span lang="zh">疾雷不及掩耳疾電不及瞑目</span> “You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or
your eyes to the lightning—so rapid are they.” Likewise, an attack
should be made so quickly that it cannot be parried.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 掠鄉分衆廓地分利</p>
<p>When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your
men;</p>
<p class="annot">The reading of Tu Yu, Chia Lin, and apparently Ts‘ao Kung, is
<span lang="zh">指向分衆</span>, which is explained as referring to the subdivision of the
army, mentioned in V. §§ 1, 2, by means of banners and flags,
serving to point out (<span lang="zh">指</span>) to each man the way he should go (<span lang="zh">向</span>).
But this is very forced, and the ellipsis is too great, even for
Sun Tzŭ. Luckily, the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> have the variant
<span lang="zh">嚮</span>, which not only suggests the true reading <span lang="zh">鄉</span>, but affords some
clue to the way in which the corruption arose. Some early
commentator having inserted <span lang="zh">向</span> as the sound of <span lang="zh">鄉</span>, the two may
afterwards have been read as one character; and this being
interchangeable with <span lang="zh">向</span>, <span lang="zh">鄉</span> must finally have disappeared
altogether. Meanwhile, <span lang="zh">掠</span> would have been altered to <span lang="zh">指</span> in order to
make sense. As regards <span lang="zh">分衆</span>, I believe that Ho Shih alone has
grasped the real meaning, the other commentators understanding it
as “dividing the men into parties” to search for plunder. Sun Tzŭ
wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by
insisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock,
which may afterwards be fairly divided amongst all.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the
benefit of the soldiery.</p>
<p class="annot">That this is the meaning, may be gathered from Tu Mu’s note:
<span lang="zh">開土拓境則分割與有功者</span>. The <span lang="zh">三略</span> gives the same advice: 𫉬地裂之. <span lang="zh">廓</span>
means “to enlarge” or “extend”—at the expense of the enemy,
understood. Cf. <cite>Shih Ching</cite>, III. 1. vii. 1: <span lang="zh">憎其式廓</span> “hating all
the great States.” Ch‘ên Hao also says <span lang="zh">屯兵種蒔</span> “quarter your
soldiers on the land, and let them sow and plant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">{63}</span> it.” It is by
acting on this principle, and harvesting the lands they invaded,
that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out some of their most
memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that of <span lang="zh">班超</span> Pan
Ch‘ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years,
those of <span lang="zh">福康安</span> Fu-k‘ang-an and <span lang="zh">左宗棠</span> Tso Tsung-t‘ang.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">21. 懸權而動</p>
<p>Ponder and deliberate</p>
<p class="annot">Note that both these words, like the Chinese <span lang="zh">懸權</span>, are really
metaphors derived from the use of scales.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">before you make a move.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü quotes <span lang="zh">尉繚子</span> as saying that we must not break camp until
we have gauged the resisting power of the enemy and the cleverness
of the opposing general. Cf. the “seven comparisons” in I. § 13.
Capt. Calthrop omits this sentence.</p>

<p class="annot">See <i>supra</i>, §§ 3, 4.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Such is the art of manœuvring.</p>
<p class="annot">With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But
there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from
an earlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the
time when Sun Tzŭ wrote. The style of this fragment is not
noticeably different from that of Sun Tzŭ himself, but no
commentator raises a doubt as to its genuineness.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">23. 軍政曰言不相聞故爲金鼓視不相見故爲旌旗</p>
<p>The Book of Army Management says:</p>
<p class="annot">It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators
give us any information about this work. Mei Yao-ch‘ên calls it
<span lang="zh">軍之舊典</span> “an ancient military classic,” and Wang Hsi, <span lang="zh">古軍書</span> “an old
book on war.” Considering the enormous amount of fighting that had
gone on for centuries before Sun Tzŭ’s time between the various
kingdoms and principalities of China, it is not in itself
improbable that a collection of military maxims should have been
made and written down at some earlier period.</p>

<p class="annot">I have retained the words <span lang="zh">金鼓</span> of the original text, which recur in

generally used in Sun Tzŭ for the enemy.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">may be focussed on one particular point.</p>
<p class="annot">Note the use of <span lang="zh">一</span> as a verb. Chang Yü says:
<span lang="zh">視聽均齊則雖百萬之衆進退如一矣</span> “If sight and hearing converge
simultaneously on the same object, the evolutions of as many as a
million soldiers will be like those of a single man”!</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">25. 民既專一則勇者不得獨進怯者不得獨退此用衆之法也</p>
<p>The host thus forming a single united body, it is impossible either
for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü quotes a saying: <span lang="zh">令不進而進與令不退而退厥罪惟均</span> “Equally
guilty are those who advance against orders and those who retreat
against orders.” Tu Mu tells a story in this connection of <span lang="zh">吳起</span> Wu
Ch‘i, when he was fighting against the Ch‘in State. Before the
battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of matchless daring,
sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the enemy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">{65}</span>
returned to camp. Wu Ch‘i had the man instantly executed,
whereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: “This man
was a good soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.” Wu Ch‘i
replied: “I fully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him
beheaded because he acted without orders.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">This is the art of handling large masses of men.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">26. 故夜戰多火鼓晝戰多旌旗所以變民之耳目也</p>
<p>In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and
in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing
the ears and eyes of your army.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has the bad variant <span lang="zh">便</span> for <span lang="zh">變</span>. With regard to the
latter word, I believe I have hit off the right meaning, the whole
phrase being slightly elliptical for “influencing the movements of
the army through their senses of sight and hearing.” Li Ch‘üan, Tu
Mu and Chia Lin certainly seem to understand it thus. The other
commentators, however, take <span lang="zh">民</span> (or <span lang="zh">人</span>) as the enemy, and <span lang="zh">變</span> as
equivalent to <span lang="zh">變惑</span> or <span lang="zh">變亂</span> “to perplex” or “confound.” This does
not agree so well with what has gone before, though on the other
hand it renders the transition to § 27 less abrupt. The whole
question, I think, hinges on the alternative readings <span lang="zh">民</span> and <span lang="zh">人</span>.
The latter would almost certainly denote the enemy. Ch‘ên Hao
alludes to <span lang="zh">李光弼</span> Li Kuang-pi’s night ride to <span lang="zh">河陽</span> Ho-yang at the
head of 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with
torches, that though the rebel leader <span lang="zh">史思明</span> Shih Ssŭ-ming had a
large army, he did not dare to dispute their passage. [Ch‘ên Hao
gives the date as <span lang="zh">天寳末</span> A.D. 756; but according to the <span lang="zh">新唐書</span> New
T‘ang History, <span lang="zh">列傳</span> 61, it must have been later than this, probably
760.]</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">27. 故三軍可奪氣將軍可奪心</p>
<p>A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;</p>
<p class="annot">“In war,” says Chang Yü, “if a spirit of anger can be made to
pervade all ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset
will be irresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy’s soldiers will
be keenest when they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is
therefore our cue not to fight at once, but to wait until their
ardour and enthusiasm have worn off, and then strike. It is in
this way that they may be robbed of their keen spirit.” Li Ch‘üan
and others tell an anecdote (to be found in the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">{66}</span> <span lang="zh">莊公</span>
year 10, § 1) of <span lang="zh">曹劌</span> Ts‘ao Kuei, a <i>protégé</i> of Duke Chuang of Lu.
The latter State was attacked by Ch‘i, and the Duke was about to
join battle at <span lang="zh">長勺</span> Ch‘ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy’s
drums, when Ts‘ao said: “Not just yet.” Only after their drums had
beaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then
they fought, and the men of Ch‘i were utterly defeated. Questioned
afterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts‘ao Kuei
replied: “In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the
first roll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the
second it is already on the wane, and after the third it is gone
altogether. I attacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at
its height. Hence our victory.” <span lang="zh">吳子</span> (chap. 4) puts “spirit” first
among the “four important influences” in war, and continues:
<span lang="zh">三軍之衆百萬之師張設輕重在於一人是謂氣機</span> “The value of a whole army—a
mighty host of a million men—is dependent on one man alone: such
is the influence of spirit!”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop goes woefully astray with “defeat his general’s
ambition.” Chang Yü says: <span lang="zh">心者將之所主也夫治亂勇怯皆主於心</span> “Presence
of mind is the general’s most important asset. It is the quality
which enables him to discipline disorder and to inspire courage
into the panic-stricken.” The great general <span lang="zh">李靖</span> Li Ching (A.D.
571–649) has a saying: <span lang="zh">夫攻者不止攻其城擊其陳而已必有攻其心之術焉</span>
“Attacking does not merely consist in assaulting walled cities or
striking at an army in battle array; it must include the art of
assailing the enemy’s mental equilibrium.” [<span lang="zh">問對</span>, pt. 3.]</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking
an army drawn up in calm and confident array:</p>
<p class="annot">For this translation of <span lang="zh">堂堂</span>, I can appeal to the authority of Tu

follow Ts‘ao Kung, who says <span lang="zh">大</span>, probably meaning “grand and
imposing”. Li Ch‘üan, however, has <span lang="zh">部分</span> “in subdivisions,” which is
somewhat strange.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_68">{68}</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">—this is the art of studying circumstances.</p>
<p class="annot">I have not attempted a uniform rendering of the four phrases <span lang="zh">治氣</span>,
<span lang="zh">治心</span>, <span lang="zh">治力</span> and <span lang="zh">治變</span>, though <span lang="zh">治</span> really bears the same meaning in each
case. It is to be taken, I think, not in the sense of “to govern”
or “control,” but rather, as K‘ang Hsi defines it, = <span lang="zh">簡習</span> “to
examine and practise,” hence “look after,” “keep a watchful eye
upon.” We may find an example of this use in the <cite>Chou Li</cite>, XVIII.
fol. 46: <span lang="zh">治其大禮</span>. Sun Tzŭ has not told us to control or restrain
the quality which he calls <span lang="zh">氣</span>, but only to observe the time at
which it is strongest. As for <span lang="zh">心</span>, it is important to remember that
in the present context it can only mean “presence of mind.” To
speak of “controlling presence of mind” is absurd, and Capt.
Calthrop’s “to have the heart under control” is hardly less so.
The whole process recommended here is that of VI. § 2: <span lang="zh">致人而不致於人</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">33. 故用兵之法高陵勿向背邱勿逆</p>
<p>It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">35. 餌兵勿食歸師勿遏</p>
<p>Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">Li Ch‘üan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a
metaphor, take these words quite literally of food and drink that
have been poisoned by the enemy. Ch‘ên Hao and Chang Yü carefully
point out that the saying has a wider application. The <cite>T‘ung
Tien</cite> reads <span lang="zh">貪</span> “to covet” instead of <span lang="zh">食</span>. The similarity of the two
characters sufficiently accounts for the mistake.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.</p>
<p class="annot">The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by
saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight
to the death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore
too dangerous an opponent to be tackled. Chang Yü quotes the words
of Han Hsin: <span lang="zh">從思東歸之士何所不克</span> “Invincible is the soldier who
hath his desire and returneth homewards.” A marvellous tale is
told of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">{69}</span> Ts‘ao Ts‘ao’s courage and resource in ch. 1 of the <cite>San
Kuo Chih</cite>, <span lang="zh">武帝紀</span>: In 198 A.D., he was besieging <span lang="zh">張繡</span> Chang Hsiu in
<span lang="zh">穰</span> Jang, when <span lang="zh">劉表</span> Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to
cutting off Ts‘ao’s retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off
his troops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies,
who were guarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had
engaged himself. In this desperate plight Ts‘ao waited until
nightfall, when he bored a tunnel into the mountain side and laid
an ambush in it. Then he marched on with his baggage-train, and
when it grew light, Chang Hsiu, finding that the bird had flown,
pressed after him in hot pursuit. As soon as the whole army had
passed by, the hidden troops fell on its rear, while Ts‘ao himself
turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were thrown
into confusion and annihilated. Ts‘ao Ts‘ao said afterwards:
<span lang="zh">虜遏吾歸師而與吾死地戰吾是以知勝矣</span> “The brigands tried to check my
army in its retreat and brought me to battle in a desperate
position: hence I knew how to overcome them.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">36. 圍師必闕窮宼勿迫</p>
<p>When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.</p>
<p class="annot">This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The
object, as Tu Mu puts it, is <span lang="zh">示以生路令無必死之心</span> “to make him
believe that there is a road to safety, and thus prevent his
fighting with the courage of despair.” Tu Mu adds pleasantly:
<span lang="zh">因而擊之</span> “After that, you may crush him.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Do not press a desperate foe too hard.</p>
<p class="annot">For <span lang="zh">迫</span>, the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> reads <span lang="zh">追</span> “pursue.” Ch‘ên Hao quotes the
saying: <span lang="zh">鳥窮則搏獸窮則噬</span> “Birds and beasts when brought to bay will
use their claws and teeth.” Chang Yü says: <span lang="zh">敵若焚舟破釜決一戰則不可逼迫來</span>
“If your adversary has burned his boats and destroyed his
cooking-pots, and is ready to stake all on the issue of a battle,
he must not be pushed to extremities.” The phrase <span lang="zh">窮宼</span> doubtless
originated with Sun Tzŭ. The <cite>P‘ei Wên Yün Fu</cite> gives four examples
of its use, the earliest being from the <cite>Ch‘ien Han Shu</cite>, and
I have found another in chap. 34 of the same work. Ho Shih
illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of <span lang="zh">符彥卿</span> Fu
Yen-ch‘ing in ch. 251 of the <span lang="zh">宋史</span>. That general, together with his
colleague <span lang="zh">杜重威</span> Tu Chung-wei, was surrounded by a vastly superior
army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D. The country was bare and
desert-like, and the little Chinese force was soon in dire straits
for want of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">{70}</span> water. The wells they bored ran dry, and the men were
reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the moisture.
Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch‘ing
exclaimed: “We are desperate men. Far better to die for our
country than to go with fettered hands into captivity!” A strong
gale happened to be blowing from the north-east and darkening the
air with dense clouds of sandy dust. Tu Chung-wei was for waiting
until this had abated before deciding on a final attack; but
luckily another officer, <span lang="zh">李守貞</span> Li Shou-chêng by name, was quicker
to see an opportunity, and said: “They are many and we are few,
but in the midst of this sandstorm our numbers will not be
discernible; victory will go to the strenuous fighter, and the
wind will be our best ally.” Accordingly, Fu Yen-ch‘ing made a
sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his cavalry, routed
the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to safety.

VARIATION OF TACTICS.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">The heading means literally “The Nine Variations,” but as Sun Tzŭ
does not appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already
told us (V. §§ 6–11) that such deflections from the ordinary
course are practically innumerable, we have little option but to
follow Wang Hsi, who says that “Nine” stands for an indefinitely
large number. “All it means is that in warfare <span lang="zh">當極其變</span> we ought to
vary our tactics to the utmost degree ... I do not know what Ts‘ao
Kung makes these Nine Variations out to be [the latter’s note is
<span lang="zh">變其正得其所用九也</span>], but it has been suggested that they are
connected with the Nine Situations”—of chap. XI. This is the view
adopted by Chang Yü: see note on <span lang="zh">死地</span>, § 2. The only other
alternative is to suppose that something has been lost—a
supposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends
some weight.</p>

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 圮地無舍衢地合交絶地無留圍地則謀死地則戰</p>
<p>When in difficult country, do not encamp.</p>
<p class="annot">For explanation of <span lang="zh">圮地</span>, see XI. § 8.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.</p>
<p class="annot">See XI, §§ 6, 12. Capt. Calthrop omits <span lang="zh">衢地</span>.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_72">{72}</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">絶地</span> is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the beginning
of chap. XI, but occurs later on (<i>ibid</i>. § 43, <i>q.v.</i>). We may
compare it with <span lang="zh">重地</span> (XI. § 7). Chang Yü calls it a <span lang="zh">危絶之地</span>,
situated across the frontier, in hostile territory. Li Ch‘üan says
it is “country in which there are no springs or wells, flocks or
herds, vegetables or firewood;” Chia Lin, “one of gorges, chasms
and precipices, without a road by which to advance.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.</p>
<p class="annot">See XI. §§ 9, 14. Capt. Calthrop has “mountainous and wooded
country,” which is a quite inadequate translation of <span lang="zh">圍</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">In a desperate position, you must fight.</p>
<p class="annot">See XI. §§ 10, 14. Chang Yü has an important note here, which must
be given in full. “From <span lang="zh">圮地無舍</span>,” he says, “down to this point,
the Nine Variations are presented to us. The reason why only five
are given is that the subject is treated <i>en précis</i> (<span lang="zh">舉其大略也</span>).
So in chap. XI, where he discusses the variations of tactics
corresponding to the Nine Grounds, Sun Tzŭ mentions only six
variations; there again we have an abridgment. [I cannot
understand what Chang Yü means by this statement. He can only be
referring to §§ 11–14 or §§ 46–50 of chap. XI; but in both places
all the nine grounds are discussed. Perhaps he is confusing
these with the Six <span lang="zh">地形</span> of chap. X.] All kinds of ground have
corresponding military positions, and also a variation of tactics
suitable to each (<span lang="zh">凡地有勢有變</span>). In chap. XI, what we find
enumerated first [§§ 2–10] are the situations; afterwards [§§
11–14] the corresponding tactics. Now, how can we tell that the
<span lang="zh">九變</span> “Nine Variations” are simply the <span lang="zh">九地之變</span> “variations of
tactics corresponding to the Nine Grounds”? It is said further
on [§ 5] that ‘the general who does not understand the nine
variations of tactics may be well acquainted with the features
of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to
practical account.’ Again, in chap. XI [§ 41] we read: ‘The
different measures adapted to the nine varieties of ground
(<span lang="zh">九地之變</span>) and the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics
must be carefully examined.’ From a consideration of these
passages the meaning is made clear. When later on the nine grounds
are enumerated, Sun Tzŭ recurs to these nine variations. He wishes
here to speak of the Five Advantages [see <i>infra</i>, § 6], so he
begins by setting forth the Nine Variations. These are inseparably
connected in practice, and therefore they are dealt with
together.” The weak point of this argument is the suggestion that
<span lang="zh">五事</span> “five things” can stand as a <span lang="zh">大畧</span>, that is, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">{73}</span> abstract or
abridgment, of nine, when those that are omitted are not less
important than those that appear, and when one of the latter is
not included amongst the nine at all.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 塗有所不由軍有所不擊城有所不攻地有所不爭君命有所不受</p>
<p>There are roads which must not be followed,</p>
<p class="annot">“Especially those leading through narrow defiles,” says Li Ch‘üan,
“where an ambush is to be feared.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">armies which must not be attacked,</p>
<p class="annot">More correctly, perhaps, “there are times when an army must not be
attacked.” Ch‘ên Hao says: “When you see your way to obtain a
trivial advantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat,
refrain from attacking, for fear of overtaxing your men’s strength.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">towns</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop says “castles”—an unfortunate attempt to introduce
local colour.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">which must not be besieged,</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. III. § 4. Ts‘ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from
his own experience. When invading the territory of <span lang="zh">徐州</span> Hsü-chou,
he ignored the city of <span lang="zh">華費</span> Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path,
and pressed on into the heart of the country. This excellent
strategy was rewarded by the subsequent capture of no fewer than
fourteen important district cities. Chang Yü says: “No town should
be attacked which, if taken, cannot be held, or if left alone,
will not cause any trouble.” <span lang="zh">荀罃</span> Hsün Ying, when urged to attack
<span lang="zh">偪陽</span> Pi-yang, replied: “The city is small and well-fortified; even
if I succeed in taking it, ’t will be no great feat of arms;
whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock.” In the
seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of
war. It was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of
marches, countermarches and manœuvres. He said: “It is a great
mistake to waste men in taking a town when the same expenditure of
soldiers will gain a province.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote173" id="FNanchor173">[173]</a></p>
<p class="trans_noindent">positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which
must not be obeyed.</p>
<p class="annot">This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for
authority, and Wei Liao Tzŭ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">{74}</span>
<span lang="zh">兵者凶器也爭者逆德也將者死官也</span> “Weapons are baleful instruments,
strife is antagonistic to virtue, a military commander is the
negation of civil order!” The unpalatable fact remains, however,
that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated to military
necessity. Cf. III. § 17. (5), X. § 23. The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has <span lang="zh">將在軍</span>
before <span lang="zh">君命</span>, etc. This is a gloss on the words by Chu-ko Liang,
which being repeated by Tu Yu became incorporated with the text.
Chang Yü thinks that these five precepts are the <span lang="zh">五利</span> referred
to in § 6. Another theory is that the mysterious <span lang="zh">九變</span> are here
enumerated, starting with <span lang="zh">圮地無舍</span> and ending at <span lang="zh">地有所不爭</span>, while
the final clause <span lang="zh">君命有所不受</span> embraces and as it were sums up all
the nine. Thus Ho Shih says: “Even if it be your sovereign’s
command to encamp in difficult country, linger in isolated
positions, etc., you must not do so.” The theory is perhaps a
little too ingenious to be accepted with confidence.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 故將通於九變之利者知用兵矣</p>
<p>The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany
variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.</p>
<p class="annot">Before <span lang="zh">利</span> in the original text there is a <span lang="zh">地</span> which is obviously not
required.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 將不通於九變之利者雖知地形不能得地之利矣</p>
<p>The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with
the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his
knowledge to practical account.</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “get the advantage of the ground,” which means not only
securing good positions, but availing oneself of natural
advantages in every possible way. Chang Yü says: “Every kind of
ground is characterised by certain natural features, and also
gives scope for a certain variability of plan. How is it possible
to turn these natural features to account unless topographical
knowledge is supplemented by versatility of mind?”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 治兵不知九變之術雖知五利不能得人之用矣</p>
<p>So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of varying his
plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will
fail to make the best use of his men.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_75">{75}</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung says that the <span lang="zh">五利</span> are <span lang="zh">下五事也</span> “the five things that
follow;” but this cannot be right. We must rather look back to the
five “variations” contained in § 3. Chia Lin (who reads <span lang="zh">五變</span> here
to balance the <span lang="zh">五利</span>) tells us that these imply five obvious and
generally advantageous lines of action, namely: “if a certain road
is short, it must be followed; if an army is isolated, it must
be attacked; if a town is in a parlous condition, it must be
besieged; if a position can be stormed, it must be attempted; and
if consistent with military operations, the ruler’s commands must
be obeyed.” But there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a
general to use these advantages. For instance, “a certain road may
be the shortest way for him, but if he knows that it abounds in
natural obstacles, or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it, he
will not follow that road. A hostile force may be open to attack,
but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely to fight with
desperation, he will refrain from striking,” and so on. Here the
<span lang="zh">變</span> comes in to modify the <span lang="zh">利</span>, and hence we see the uselessness of
knowing the one without the other—of having an eye for weaknesses
in the enemy’s armour without being clever enough to recast one’s
plans on the spur of the moment. Capt. Calthrop offers this
slovenly translation: “In the management of armies, if the art of
the Nine Changes be understood [<i>sic</i>], a knowledge of the Five
Advantages is of no avail.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 是故智者之慮必雜於利害</p>
<p>Hence in the wise leader’s plans, considerations of advantage and of
disadvantage will be blended together.</p>
<p class="annot">“Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one,”
says Ts‘ao Kung, “the opposite state should be always present to
your mind.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 雜於利而務可信也</p>
<p>If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may
succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">信</span>, according to Tu Mu, is equivalent to <span lang="zh">申</span>, and <span lang="zh">務可信也</span> is
paraphrased by Chang Yü as <span lang="zh">可以伸己之事</span>. Tu Mu goes on to say: “If
we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must not fix our
minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the enemy
also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into
our calculations.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 雜於害而患可解也</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">{76}</span> are always
ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.</p>
<p class="annot">A translator cannot emulate the conciseness of <span lang="zh">雜於害</span> “to blend
[thoughts of advantage] with disadvantage,” but the meaning is as
given. Tu Mu says: “If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous
position, I must consider not only the enemy’s ability to injure
me, but also my own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy.
If in my counsels these two considerations are properly blended,
I shall succeed in liberating myself.... For instance, if I am
surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting an escape, the
nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pursue and
crush me; it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a
bold counter-attack, and use the advantage thus gained to free
myself from the enemy’s toils.” See the story of Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, VII.
§ 35, note. In his first edition, Capt. Calthrop translated §§ 7–9
as follows: “The wise man perceives clearly wherein lies advantage
and disadvantage. While recognising an opportunity, he does not
overlook the risks, and saves future anxiety.” This has now been
altered into: “The wise man considers well both advantage and
disadvantage. He sees a way out of adversity, <em>and on the day of
victory to danger is not blind</em>.” Owing to a needless inversion of
the Chinese, the words which I have italicised are evidently
intended to represent § 8!</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 是故屈諸侯者以害役諸侯者以業趨諸侯者以利</p>
<p>Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;</p>
<p class="annot">Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some
of which would only occur to the Oriental mind:—“Entice away the
enemy’s best and wisest men, so that he may be left without
counsellors. Introduce traitors into his country, that the
government policy may be rendered futile. Foment intrigue and
deceit, and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his
ministers. By means of every artful contrivance, cause
deterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure. Corrupt
his morals by insidious gifts leading him into excess. Disturb and
unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women.” Chang Yü
(after Wang Hsi) considers the <span lang="zh">害</span> to be military chastisement: “Get
the enemy,” he says, “into a position where he must suffer injury,
and he will submit of his own accord.” Capt. Calthrop twists Sun
Tzŭ’s words into an absurdly barbarous precept: “In reducing an
enemy to submission, inflict all possible damage upon him.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">make trouble for them,</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">業</span> is defined by Ts‘ao Kung as <span lang="zh">事</span>, and his definition is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">{77}</span>
adopted by the commentators. Tu Mu, however, seems to take it in
the sense of “possessions,” or, as we might say, “assets,” which
he considers to be <span lang="zh">兵衆國富人和令行</span> “a large army, a rich exchequer,
harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfilment of commands.”
These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and keep them constantly engaged;</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">役</span>, literally, “make servants of them.” Tu Yu says <span lang="zh">令不得安佚</span>
“prevent them from having any rest.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.</p>
<p class="annot">Mêng Shih’s note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic
use of <span lang="zh">變</span>: <span lang="zh">令忘變而速至</span> “cause them to forget <i>pien</i> (the reasons
for acting otherwise than on their first impulse), and hasten in
our direction.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 故用兵之法無恃其不來恃吾有以待也無恃其不攻恃吾有所不可攻也</p>
<p>The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s
not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him;</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> read <span lang="zh">有能以待之也</span>, but the conciser
form is more likely to be right.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the
fact that we have made our position unassailable.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> insert <span lang="zh">吾也</span> after the first <span lang="zh">攻</span>, and

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 故將有五危必死可殺也必生可虜也忿速可侮也廉潔可辱也愛民可煩也</p>
<p>There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)
Recklessness, which leads to destruction;</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">勇而無慮</span> “Bravery without forethought,” as Ts‘ao Kung analyses it,
which causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad
bull. Such an opponent, says Chang Yü, “must not be encountered
with brute force, but may be lured into an ambush and slain.” Cf.
Wu Tzŭ, chap. IV <i>ad init.</i>: <span lang="zh">凡人論將常觀於勇勇之於將乃數分</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">{78}</span><span lang="zh">之一耳夫勇者必輕合輕合而不知利未可也</span>
“In estimating the character of a general,
men are wont to pay exclusive attention to his courage, forgetting
that courage is only one out of many qualities which a general
should possess. The merely brave man is prone to fight recklessly;
and he who fights recklessly, without any perception of what is
expedient, must be condemned.” Ssŭ-ma Fa, too, makes the incisive
remark <span lang="zh">上死不勝</span> “Simply going to one’s death does not bring about
victory.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">必生</span> is explained by Ts‘ao Kung of the man “whom timidity prevents
from advancing to seize an advantage,” and Wang Hsi adds, “who is
quick to flee at the sight of danger.” Mêng Shih gives the closer
paraphrase <span lang="zh">志必生反</span> “he who is bent on returning alive,” that is,
the man who will never take a risk. But, as Sun Tzŭ knew, nothing
is to be achieved in war unless you are willing to take risks.
T‘ai Kung said: <span lang="zh">失利後時反受其殃</span> “He who lets an advantage slip will
subsequently bring upon himself real disaster.” In 404 A.D., <span lang="zh">劉裕</span>
Liu Yü pursued the rebel <span lang="zh">桓𤣥</span> Huan Hsüan up the Yangtsze and fought
a naval battle with him at <span lang="zh">崢嶸洲</span> the island of Ch‘êng-hung. The
loyal troops numbered only a few thousands, while their opponents
were in great force. But Huan Hsüan, fearing the fate which was in
store for him should he be overcome, had a light boat made fast to
the side of his war-junk, so that he might escape, if necessary,
at a moment’s notice. The natural result was that the fighting
spirit of his soldiers was utterly quenched, and when the
loyalists made an attack from windward with fireships, all
striving with the utmost ardour to be first in the fray, Huan
Hsüan’s forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled
for two days and nights without stopping. [<i>See</i> <span lang="zh">晉書</span>, chap. 99,
fol. 13.] Chang Yü tells a somewhat similar story of <span lang="zh">趙嬰齊</span> Chao
Ying-ch‘i, a general of the Chin State who during a battle with
the army of Ch‘u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness for him
on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get
across.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;</p>
<p class="annot">I fail to see the meaning of Capt. Calthrop’s “which brings
insult.” Tu Mu tells us that <span lang="zh">姚襄</span> Yao Hsiang, when opposed in 357
A.D. by <span lang="zh">黃眉</span> Huang Mei, <span lang="zh">鄧羌</span> Têng Ch‘iang and others, shut himself
up behind his walls and refused to fight. Têng Ch‘iang said: “Our
adversary is of a choleric temper and easily provoked; let us make
constant sallies and break down his walls, then he will grow angry
and come out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">{79}</span> Once we can bring his force to battle, it is doomed
to be our prey.” This plan was acted upon, Yao Hsiang came out to
fight, was lured on as far as <span lang="zh">三原</span> San-yuan by the enemy’s
pretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;</p>
<p class="annot">This need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really
a defect in a general. What Sun Tzŭ condemns is rather an
exaggerated sensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned
man who is stung by opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch‘ên
truly observes, though somewhat paradoxically: <span lang="zh">徇名不顧</span> “The seeker
after glory should be careless of public opinion.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and
trouble.</p>
<p class="annot">Here again, Sun Tzŭ does not mean that the general is to be
careless of the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasise
is the danger of sacrificing any important military advantage to
the immediate comfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy,
because in the long run the troops will suffer more from the
defeat, or, at best, the prolongation of the war, which will be
the consequence. A mistaken feeling of pity will often induce
a general to relieve a beleaguered city, or to reinforce a
hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his military instincts. It
is now generally admitted that our repeated efforts to relieve
Ladysmith in the South African War were so many strategical
blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end, relief
came through the very man who started out with the distinct
resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to
sentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our
generals who failed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I
remember, to defend him to me on the ground that he was always “so
good to his men.” By this plea, had he but known it, he was only
condemning him out of Sun Tzŭ’s mouth.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 凡此五者將之過也用兵之災也</p>
<p>These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct
of war.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 覆軍殺將必以五危不可不察也</p>
<p>When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely
be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of
meditation.</p>

<p class="annot">Tu Mu says that <span lang="zh">依</span> here = <span lang="zh">近</span>. The idea is, not to linger among
barren uplands, but to keep close to supplies of water and grass.
Capt. Calthrop translates “camp in valleys,” heedless of the very
next sentence. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 3: <span lang="zh">無當天竈</span> “Abide not in natural
ovens,” <i>i.e.</i> <span lang="zh">大谷之口</span> “the openings of large valleys.” Chang Yü
tells the following anecdote: “<span lang="zh">武都羗</span> Wu-tu Ch‘iang was a robber
captain in the time of the Later Han, and <span lang="zh">馬援</span> Ma Yuan was sent to
exterminate his gang. Ch‘iang having found a refuge in the hills,
Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but seized all the
favourable positions commanding supplies of water and forage.
Ch‘iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of provisions
that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not know the
advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys.”</p>

in your evolutions.” The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> reads <span lang="zh">敵若絶水</span> “If <em>the

River. Turning to the <i>Ch‘ien Han Shu</i>, ch. 34, fol. 6 <i>verso</i>, we
find the battle described as follows: “The two armies were drawn
up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered
his men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and
construct a dam a little higher up. Then, leading half his army
across, he attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">{82}</span> Lung Chü; but after a time, pretending to have
failed in his attempt, he hastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung
Chü was much elated by this unlooked-for success, and exclaiming:
“I felt sure that Han Hsin was really a coward!” he pursued him
and began crossing the river in his turn. Han Hsin now sent a
party to cut open the sandbags, thus releasing a great volume of
water, which swept down and prevented the greater portion of Lung
Chü’s army from getting across. He then turned upon the force
which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chü himself being
amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further bank, also
scattered and fled in all directions.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 欲戰者無附於水而迎客</p>
<p>If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader
near a river which he has to cross.</p>

<p>Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.</p>
<p class="annot">See <i>supra</i>, § 2. The repetition of these words in connection with
water is very awkward. Chang Yü has the note: <span lang="zh">或岸邊爲陳或水上泊舟皆須面陽而居高</span>
“Said either of troops marshalled on the river-bank,
or of boats anchored in the stream itself; in either case it is
essential to be higher than the enemy and facing the sun.” The
other commentators are not at all explicit. One is much tempted
to reject their explanation of <span lang="zh">視生</span> altogether, and understand it
simply as “seeking safety.” [Cf. <span lang="zh">必生</span> in VIII. § 12, and <i>infra</i>,
§ 9.] It is true that this involves taking <span lang="zh">視</span> in an unusual, though
not, I think, an impossible sense. Of course the earlier passage
would then have to be translated in like manner.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says: “As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp
on the lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open
the sluices and sweep us away in a flood. This is implied above
in the words <span lang="zh">視生處高</span>. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that ‘in river
warfare we must not advance against the stream,’ which is as
much as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of
the enemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the
current and make short work of us.” There is also the danger,
noted by other commentators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">{83}</span> that the enemy may throw poison on
the water to be carried down to us. Capt. Calthrop’s first version
was: “Do not cross rivers in the face of the stream”—a sapient
piece of advice, which made one curious to know what the correct
way of crossing rivers might be. He has now improved this into:
“Do not fight when the enemy is between the army and the source of
the river.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">So much for river warfare.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 絶斥澤惟亟去無留</p>
<p>In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them

<p class="annot">Li Ch‘üan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous

In the <span lang="zh">六韜</span> it is mentioned that he “fought seventy battles and
pacified the Empire.” Ts‘ao Kung’s explanation is, that the Yellow
Emperor was the first to institute the feudal system of vassal
princes, each of whom (to the number of four) originally bore
the title of Emperor. Li Ch‘üan tells us that the art of war

enough as a defile or narrow pass: <span lang="zh">兩邊險絶形狹長而數里</span>, and Chang

commentators certainly inclines to the rendering “defile”. But the
ordinary meaning of <span lang="zh">𨻶</span> (a crack or fissure) and the fact that <span lang="zh">絶澗</span>

but there are several objections to the reading: (1) <span lang="zh">蔣</span> is unlikely
to have got into the text as a gloss on <span lang="zh">潢</span>; (2) it is easy to
suppose, on the other hand, that <span lang="zh">蔣</span> and afterwards <span lang="zh">生</span> (to restore
the balance of the sentence) were omitted by a copyist who jumped
to the conclusion that <span lang="zh">潢</span> and <span lang="zh">井</span> must go together; (3) the sense,
when one comes to consider it, actually requires <span lang="zh">蔣</span>, for it is
absurd to talk of pools and ponds as in themselves suitable places

in the text at this early date. It may be added that the <cite>T‘ung

<p class="annot">Here begin Sun Tzŭ’s remarks on the reading of signs, much of
which is so good that it could almost be included in a modern

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 遠而挑戰者欲人之進也</p>
<p>When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for
the other side to advance.</p>
<p class="annot">Probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes
to dislodge us. “If he came close up to us,” says Tu Mu, “and
tried to force a battle, he would seem to despise us, and there
would be less probability of our responding to the challenge.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 其所居者易利也</p>
<p>If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.</p>

Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite>, <span lang="zh">其所處者居易利也</span>, is pretty obviously corrupt.
The original text, which transposes <span lang="zh">易</span> and <span lang="zh">者</span>, may very possibly be
right. Tu Mu tells us that there is yet another reading:
<span lang="zh">士爭其所居者易利也</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">21. 衆樹動者來也衆草多障者疑也</p>
<p>Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is
advancing.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung explains this as “felling trees to clear a passage,”
and Chang Yü says: “Every army sends out scouts to climb high
places and observe the enemy. If a scout sees that the trees of a
forest are moving and shaking, he may know that they are being cut
down to clear a passage for the enemy’s march.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass
means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.</p>
<p class="annot">Whenever the meaning of a passage happens to be somewhat elusive,
Capt. Calthrop seems to consider himself justified in giving free
rein to the imagination. Thus, though his text is here identical
with ours, he renders the above: “Broken branches and trodden
grass, as of the passing of a large host, must be regarded with
suspicion.” Tu Yu’s explanation, borrowed from Ts‘ao Kung, is as
follows: “The presence of a number of screens or sheds in the
midst of thick vegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled
and, fearing pursuit, has constructed these hiding-places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">{89}</span> in order
to make us suspect an ambush.” It appears that these “screens”
were hastily knotted together out of any long grass which the
retreating enemy happened to come across.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">22. 鳥起者伏也獸駭者覆也</p>
<p>The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü’s explanation is doubtless right: “When birds that are
flying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means
that soldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.</p>
<p class="annot">An example of <span lang="zh">覆</span> <i>fou</i><sup>4</sup> in the meaning of “ambuscade” may be found
in the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, <span lang="zh">隱</span> 9<sup>th</sup> year: <span lang="zh">君爲三覆以待之</span>. In the present
passage, however, it is to be distinguished from <span lang="zh">伏</span> just above, in
that it implies onward motion on the part of the attacking force.
Thus, Li Ch‘üan defines it as <span lang="zh">不意而至</span>, and Tu Mu as <span lang="zh">來襲我也</span>.</p>

betokens the approach of infantry.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">高而銳</span> “high and sharp,” or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat
exaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the
phenomenon by saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than
men, raise more dust, and also follow one another in the same
wheel-track, whereas foot-soldiers would be marching in ranks,
many abreast. According to Chang Yü, “every army on the march must
have scouts (<span lang="zh">探候之人</span>) some way in advance, who on sighting dust
raised by the enemy, will gallop back and report it to the
commander-in-chief.” Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: “As you move along,
say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar for
the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting

<p>Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is

<p class="annot">“As though they stood in great fear of us,” says Tu Mu. “Their
object is to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they
will attack us.” Chang Yü alludes to the story of <span lang="zh">田單</span> T‘ien Tan of
the Ch‘i State, who in 279 B.C. was hard-pressed in his defence of
<span lang="zh">卽墨</span> Chi-mo against the Yen forces, led by <span lang="zh">騎劫</span> Ch‘i Chieh. In ch.
82 of the <cite>Shih Chi</cite> we read: “T‘ien Tan openly said: ‘My only
fear is that the Yen army may cut off the noses of their Ch‘i
prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight against us;
that would be the undoing of our city.’ The other side being
informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion;
but those within the city were enraged at seeing their
fellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they
should fall into the enemy’s hands, were nerved to defend
themselves more obstinately than ever. Once again T‘ien Tan sent
back converted spies who reported these words to the enemy: ‘What
I dread most is that the men of Yen may dig up the ancestral
tombs outside the town, and by inflicting this indignity on our
forefathers cause us to become faint-hearted.’ Forthwith the
besiegers dug up all the graves and burned the corpses lying in
them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo, witnessing the outrage from
the city-walls, wept passionately and were all impatient to go out
and fight, their fury being increased tenfold. T‘ien Tan knew then
that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise. But instead of a
sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and ordered others
to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the ranks were
filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served out all
the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The regular
soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were manned
with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys were
despatched to the enemy’s camp to arrange terms of surrender,
whereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T‘ien Tan also
collected 20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the
wealthy citizens of Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the
prayer that, when the town capitulated, he would not allow their
homes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated. Ch‘i Chieh,
in high good humour, granted their prayer; but his army now became
increasingly slack and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">{91}</span> careless. Meanwhile, T‘ien Tan got together
a thousand oxen, decked them with pieces of red silk, painted
their bodies, dragon-like, with coloured stripes, and fastened
sharp blades on their horns and well-greased rushes on their
tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the rushes, and
drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had pierced in
the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked warriors.
The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the enemy’s
camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for their
tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their
bodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with
whom they came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had
crept up with gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on
the enemy. At the same moment a frightful din arose in the city
itself, all those that remained behind making as much noise as
possible by banging drums and hammering on bronze vessels, until
heaven and earth were convulsed by the uproar. Terror-stricken,
the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly pursued by the men of Ch‘i,
who succeeded in slaying their general Ch‘i Chieh.... The result
of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some seventy cities
which had belonged to the Ch‘i State.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs

point of sense. <span lang="zh">詭</span> not only provides no antithesis to <span lang="zh">卑</span>, but makes
the whole passage absurd; for if the language of the enemy is
calculated to deceive, it cannot be known as deceitful at the
time, and can therefore afford no “sign.” Moreover, the extra word
in <span lang="zh">强進驅者</span> (an awkward locution, by the way) spoils the parallelism

the <cite>P‘ei Wên Yün Fu</cite>: “The rebel <span lang="zh">王國</span> Wang Kuo of <span lang="zh">梁</span> Liang was
besieging the town of <span lang="zh">陳倉</span> Ch‘ên-ts‘ang, and <span lang="zh">皇甫嵩</span> Huang-fu Sung,
who was in supreme command, and <span lang="zh">董卓</span> Tung Cho were sent out against
him. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf
ear to his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and
began to throw down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was
now for advancing to the attack, but Cho said: ‘It is a principle
of war not to pursue desperate men and not to press a retreating
host.’ Sung answered: ‘That does not apply here. What I am about
to attack is a jaded army, not a retreating host; with disciplined
troops I am falling on a disorganised multitude, not a band of
desperate men.’ Thereupon he advanced to the attack unsupported by
his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo being slain.” The
inferior reading of the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> for § 34 is as follows:
<span lang="zh">殺馬肉食者軍無糧也懸缻不返其舍者窮宼也</span>. The first clause strikes me as rather
shallow for Sun Tzŭ, and it is hard to make anything of <span lang="zh">懸缻</span> in
the second without the negative. Capt. Calthrop, nothing daunted,
set down in his first edition: “When they <em>cast away</em> their
cooking-pots.” He now has: “When the cooking-pots are hung up on
the wall.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">35. 諄諄翕翕徐言入入者失衆也</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">in small knots</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>Shuo Wên</cite> rather strangely defines <span lang="zh">翕</span> by the word <span lang="zh">起</span>, but the
<i>Êrh Ya</i> says <span lang="zh">合</span> “to join” or “contract,” which is undoubtedly its
primary meaning. Chang Yü is right, then, in explaining it here by
the word <span lang="zh">聚</span>. The other commentators are very much at sea: Ts‘ao
Kung says <span lang="zh">失志貌</span>, Tu Yu <span lang="zh">不眞</span>, Tu Mu <span lang="zh">顚倒失次貌</span>, Chia Lin <span lang="zh">不安貌</span>, Mei

<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">失衆</span> is equivalent to <span lang="zh">失其衆心</span>, the subject of course being “the
general,” understood. In the original text, which seems to be
followed by several commentators, the whole passage stands thus:
<span lang="zh">諄諄翕翕徐與人言者失衆也</span>. Here it would be the general who is talking
to his men, not the men amongst themselves. For <span lang="zh">翕</span>, which is the
chief stumbling-block in the way of this reading, the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>
gives the very plausible emendation <span lang="zh">𧬈</span> (also read <i>hsi</i>, and
defined by K‘ang Hsi as <span lang="zh">疾言</span> “to speak fast”). But this is
unnecessary if we keep to the standard text.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">36. 屢賞者窘也數罰者困也</p>
<p>Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his
resources;</p>
<p class="annot">Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is
always a fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the
men in good temper.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.</p>
<p class="annot">Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted
severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">37. 先暴而後畏其衆者不精之至也</p>
<p>To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy’s
numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.</p>
<p class="annot">I follow the interpretation of Ts‘ao Kung: <span lang="zh">先輕敵後聞其衆則心惡之也</span>,
also adopted by Li Ch‘üan, Tu Mu and Chang Yü. Another possible
meaning, set forth by Tu Yu, Chia Lin, Mei Yao-ch‘ên and Wang Hsi,
is: “The general who is first tyrannical towards his men, and then
in terror lest they should mutiny, etc.” This would connect the
sentence with what went before about rewards and punishments. The
<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> read <span lang="zh">情</span> “affection” instead of <span lang="zh">精</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">38. 來委謝者欲休息也</p>
<p>When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign
that the enemy wishes for a truce.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_96">{96}</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">所以委質來謝此乃勢已窮或有他故必欲休息也</span> “If the enemy
open friendly relations by sending hostages, it is a sign that
they are anxious for an armistice, either because their strength
is exhausted or for some other reason.” But it hardly needs a Sun
Tzŭ to draw such an obvious inference; and although Tu Mu is
supported by Mei Yao-ch‘ên and Chang Yü, I cannot think that
hostages are indicated by the word <span lang="zh">委</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">39. 兵怒而相迎久而不合又不相去必謹察之</p>
<p>If the enemy’s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for
a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off
again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and
circumspection.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop falls into a trap which often lurks in the word <span lang="zh">相</span>.
He translates: “When both sides, eager for a fight, face each
other for a considerable time, neither advancing nor retiring,”
etc. Had he reflected a little, he would have seen that this is
meaningless as addressed to a commander who has control over the
movements of his own troops. <span lang="zh">相迎</span>, then, does not mean that the two
armies go to meet each other, but simply that the other side comes
up to us. Likewise with <span lang="zh">相去</span>. If this were not perfectly clear of
itself, Mei Yao-ch‘ên’s paraphrase would make it so: <span lang="zh">怒而來逆我</span>,
etc. As Ts‘ao Kung points out, a manœuvre of this sort may be only
a <i>ruse</i> to gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying
of an ambush.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">40. 兵非益多也惟無武進足以倂力料敵取人而已</p>
<p>If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply
sufficient;</p>
<p class="annot">Wang Hsi’s paraphrase, partly borrowed from Ts‘ao Kung, is
<span lang="zh">權力均足矣</span>. Another reading, adopted by Chia Lin and the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>,
is <span lang="zh">兵非貴益多</span>, which Capt. Calthrop renders, much too loosely:
“Numbers are no certain mark of strength.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">it only means that no direct attack can be made.</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “no martial advance.” That is to say, <span lang="zh">正</span> “<i>chêng</i>”
tactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem
resorted to instead.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,
keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_97">{97}</p>
<p class="annot">This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed
in squeezing very good sense out of it. The difficulty lies
chiefly in the words <span lang="zh">取人</span>, which have been taken in every possible
way. I follow Li Ch‘üan, who appears to offer the simplest
explanation: <span lang="zh">惟得人者勝也</span> “Only the side that gets more men will
win.” Ts‘ao Kung’s note, concise as usual to the verge of
incomprehensibility, is <span lang="zh">厮養足也</span>. Fortunately we have Chang Yü to
expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself:
<span lang="zh">兵力既均又未見便雖未足剛進足以取人於厮養之中以并兵合力察敵而取勝不必假他兵以助己</span>
“When the numbers are even, and no favourable opening
presents itself, although we may not be strong enough to deliver
a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst our
sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces
and keeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the
victory. But we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.”
He then quotes from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 3: <span lang="zh">助卒名爲十萬其實不過數萬耳</span>
“The nominal strength of mercenary troops may be 100,000, but
their real value will be not more than half that figure.”
According to this interpretation, <span lang="zh">取人</span> means “to get recruits,” not
from outside, but from the tag-rag and bobtail which follows in
the wake of a large army. This does not sound a very soldierly
suggestion, and I feel convinced that it is not what Sun Tzŭ
meant. Chia Lin, on the other hand, takes the words in a different
sense altogether, namely “to conquer the enemy” [cf. I. § 20]. But
in that case they could hardly be followed by <span lang="zh">而已</span>. Better than
this would be the rendering “to make isolated captures,” as
opposed to <span lang="zh">武進</span> “a general attack.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">41. 夫惟無慮而易敵者必擒於人</p>
<p>He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is
sure to be captured by them.</p>
<p class="annot">The force of <span lang="zh">夫惟</span> is not easy to appreciate. Ch‘én Hao says <span lang="zh">殊無遠慮但輕敵者</span>,
thus referring <span lang="zh">惟</span> to the second verb. He continues, quoting
from the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>: <span lang="zh">蜂蠆有毒而况國乎則小敵亦不可輕</span> “If bees and
scorpions carry poison, how much more will a hostile state! [<span lang="zh">僖公</span>,
XXII. 3.] Even a puny opponent, then, should not be treated with
contempt.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">42. 卒未親附而罰之則不服不服則難用也卒已親附而罰不行則不可用也</p>
<p>If soldiers are punished before they have grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">{98}</span> attached to you, they
will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, they will be
practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to
you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.</p>
<p class="annot">This is wrongly translated by Capt. Calthrop: “If the troops know
the general, but are not affected by his punishments, they are
useless.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">43. 故令之以文齊之以武是謂必取</p>
<p>Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with
humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">文</span> and <span lang="zh">武</span>, according to Ts‘ao Kung, are here equivalent to <span lang="zh">仁</span> and
<span lang="zh">法</span> respectively. Compare our two uses of the word “civil.” <span lang="zh">晏子</span> Yen
Tzŭ [✝ B.C. 493] said of <span lang="zh">司馬穰苴</span> Ssŭ-ma Jang-chü: <span lang="zh">文能附衆武能威敵也</span>
“His civil virtues endeared him to the people; his martial prowess
kept his enemies in awe.” Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 4 <i>init</i>.: <span lang="zh">夫總文武者軍之將也兼剛柔者兵之事也</span>
“The ideal commander unites culture with a
warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination
of hardness and tenderness.” Again I must find fault with Capt.
Calthrop’s translation: “By humane treatment we obtain obedience;
authority brings uniformity.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">This is a certain road to victory.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">44. 令素行以教其民則民服令不素行以教其民則民不服</p>
<p>If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army
will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> read: <span lang="zh">令素行以教其人者也令素行則人服令素不行則人不服</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">45. 令素信著者與衆相得也</p>
<p>If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his
orders being obeyed,</p>
<p class="annot">The original text has <span lang="zh">令素行者</span>. <span lang="zh">令素</span> is certainly awkward without
<span lang="zh">行</span>, but on the other hand it is clear that Tu Mu accepted the
<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> text, which is identical with ours. He says: “A
general ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">{99}</span> in time of peace to show kindly confidence in his
men and also make his authority respected, so that when they
come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline
maintained, because they all trust and look up to him.” What Sun
Tzŭ has said in § 44, however, would lead one rather to expect
something like this: “If a general is always confident that his
orders will be carried out,” etc. Hence I am tempted to think that
he may have written <span lang="zh">令素信行者</span>. But this is perhaps too conjectural.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the gain will be mutual.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü says: <span lang="zh">上以信使民民以信服上是上下相得也</span> “The general has
confidence in the men under his command, and the men are docile,
having confidence in him. Thus the gain is mutual.” He quotes a
pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 4: <span lang="zh">令之之法小過無更小疑無中</span>
“The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders
and not to be swayed by petty doubts.” Vacillation and fussiness
are the surest means of sapping the confidence of an army. Capt.
Calthrop winds up the chapter with a final mistranslation of a
more than usually heinous description: “Orders are always obeyed,
if general and soldiers are in sympathy.” Besides inventing the
latter half of the sentence, he has managed to invert protasis and
apodosis.</p>

soldier and can hardly have had any practical experience of
fighting, goes more into detail and speaks of protecting the line
of communications by a wall (<span lang="zh">壘</span>), or enclosing it by embankments on
each side (<span lang="zh">作甬道</span>)! In view of Napoleon’s dictum, “the secret of
war lies in the communications,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote175" id="FNanchor175">[175]</a> we could wish that Sun Tzŭ
had done more than skirt the edge of this important subject here
and in I. § 10, VII. § 11. Col. Henderson says: “The line of
supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an army as
the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duellist who
finds his adversary’s point menacing him with certain death, and
his own guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary’s
movements, and to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so
the commander whose communications are suddenly threatened finds
himself in a false position, and he will be fortunate if he has
not to change all his plans, to split up his force into more or
less isolated detachments, and to fight with inferior numbers on
ground which he has not had time to prepare, and where defeat will

anecdote of <span lang="zh">裴行儉</span> P‘ei Hsing-chien (A.D. 619–682), who was sent
on a punitive expedition against the Turkic tribes. “At nightfall
he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been completely
fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders that the
army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was highly
displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the
extra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P‘ei Hsing-chien,
however, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp
moved as quickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm
came on, which flooded their former place of encampment to the
depth of over twelve feet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed
at the sight, and owned that they had been in the wrong. ‘How did
you know what was going to happen?’ they asked. P‘ei Hsing-chien
replied: ‘From this time forward be content to obey orders without
asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">{104}</span> unnecessary questions.’ [See <cite>Chiu T‘ang Shu</cite>, ch. 84, fol.
12 <i>r</i><sup>o</sup>, and <cite>Hsin T‘ang Shu</cite>, ch. 108, fol. 5 <i>v</i><sup>o</sup>.] From this
it may be seen,” Chang Yü continues, “that high and sunny places
are advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are
immune from disastrous floods.”</p>

army against <span lang="zh">王廷湊</span> Wang T‘ing-ts‘ou. But the whole time he was in
command, his soldiers treated him with the utmost contempt, and
openly flouted his authority by riding about the camp on donkeys,
several thousands at a time. T‘ien Pu was powerless to put a stop
to this conduct, and when,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">{106}</span> after some months had passed, he made an
attempt to engage the enemy, his troops turned tail and dispersed
in every direction. After that, the unfortunate man committed
suicide by cutting his throat.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the
result is <em>collapse</em>.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung says: <span lang="zh">吏强欲進卒弱輒陷</span> “The officers are energetic and
want to press on, the common soldiers are feeble and suddenly
collapse.” Note that <span lang="zh">弱</span> is to be taken literally of physical
weakness, whereas in the former clause it is figurative. Li Ch‘üan
makes <span lang="zh">陷</span> equivalent to <span lang="zh">敗</span>, and Tu Mu explains it as <span lang="zh">陷沒於死地</span>
“stumbling into a death-trap.”</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle

<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung makes <span lang="zh">大將</span>, understood, the subject of <span lang="zh">怒</span>, which seems
rather far-fetched. Wang Hsi’s note is: <span lang="zh">謂將怒不以理且不知禆佐之才激致其兇難如山之崩壞也</span>
“This means, the general is angry without just
cause, and at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his
subordinate officers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings
an avalanche of ruin upon his head.” He takes <span lang="zh">能</span>, therefore,
in the sense of <span lang="zh">才</span>; but I think that Ch‘ên Hao is right in his
paraphrase <span lang="zh">不顧能否</span> “they don’t care if it be possible or no.” My
interpretation of the whole passage is that of Mei Yao-ch‘ên and
Chang Yü. Tu Mu gives a long extract from the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, <span lang="zh">宣公</span>,
XII. 3, showing how the great battle of <span lang="zh">邲</span> Pi [597 B.C.] was lost

<p>When a general, unable to estimate the enemy’s strength, allows an

<span lang="zh">出軍行師將在自專進退內御則功難成故聖主明王跪而推轂</span> “The responsibility of setting an

retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will
hardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened
monarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their

This means that <span lang="zh">閫外之事將軍裁之</span> “in matters lying outside the
zenana, the decision of the military commander must be absolute.”
Chang Yü also quotes the saying: <span lang="zh">軍中不聞天子之詔</span> “Decrees of the

<p class="annot">Cf. I. § 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging
picture of the famous general Wu Ch‘i, from whose treatise on war
I have frequently had occasion to quote: “He wore the same clothes
and ate the same food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to
have either a horse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own
surplus rations wrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship
with his men. One of his soldiers was suffering from an abscess,
and Wu Ch‘i himself sucked out the virus. The soldier’s mother,
hearing this, began wailing and lamenting. Somebody asked her,
saying: ‘Why do you cry? Your son is only a common soldier, and
yet the commander-in-chief himself has sucked the poison from his
sore.’ The woman replied: ‘Many years ago, Lord Wu performed a
similar service for my husband, who never left him afterwards, and
finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And now that he
has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I know not
where’.” Li Ch‘üan mentions <span lang="zh">楚子</span> the Viscount of Ch‘u, who invaded
the small state of <span lang="zh">蕭</span> Hsiao during the winter. <span lang="zh">申公</span> The Duke of
Shên said to him: “Many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">{111}</span> the soldiers are suffering severely
from the cold.” So he made a round of the whole army, comforting
and encouraging the men; and straightway they felt as if they
were clothed in garments lined with floss silk. [<cite>Tso Chuan</cite>, <span lang="zh">宣公</span>,

<p class="annot">Cf. IX. § 42. We read in the <span lang="zh">陰符經</span>, pt. 2: <span lang="zh">害生于思</span> “Injury comes

Mu recalls an instance of stern military discipline which occurred
in 219 A.D., when <span lang="zh">呂蒙</span> Lü Mêng was occupying the town of <span lang="zh">江陵</span>
Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his army not to
molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by force.
Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who
happened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo
hat (<span lang="zh">笠</span>) belonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over
his regulation helmet as a protection against the rain. Lü Mêng
considered that the fact of his being also a native of <span lang="zh">汝南</span> Ju-nan
should not be allowed to palliate a clear breach of discipline,
and accordingly he ordered his summary execution, the tears
rolling down his face, however, as he did so. This act of severity
filled the army with wholesome awe, and from that time forth even
articles dropped in the highway were not picked up. [<cite>San Kuo

<p class="annot">Cf. III. § 13 (1).</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">29. 知敵之可擊知吾卒之可以擊而不知地形之不可以戰勝之半也</p>
<p>If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our
men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of
the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only
halfway towards victory.</p>
<p class="annot">I may take this opportunity of pointing out the rather nice
distinction in meaning between <span lang="zh">擊</span> and <span lang="zh">攻</span>. The latter is simply “to
attack” without any further implication, whereas <span lang="zh">擊</span> is a stronger
word which in nine cases out of ten means “to attack with
expectation of victory,” “to fall upon,” as we should say, or even
“to crush.” On the other hand, <span lang="zh">擊</span> is not quite synonymous with <span lang="zh">伐</span>,
which is mostly used of operations on a larger scale, as of one
State <em>making war</em> on another, often with the added idea of
invasion. <span lang="zh">征</span>, finally, has special reference to the subjugation of
rebels. See Mencius, VII. 2. ii. 2.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">30. 故知兵者動而不迷舉而不窮</p>
<p>Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered;
once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.</p>
<p class="annot">The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his
measures so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. “He does
not move recklessly,” says Chang Yü, “so that when he does move,
he makes no mistakes.” Another reading substitutes <span lang="zh">困</span> for <span lang="zh">迷</span> and
<span lang="zh">頓</span> for <span lang="zh">窮</span>. The latter variant only is adopted by the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>
and <cite>Yü Lan</cite>. Note that <span lang="zh">窮</span> here means “at the end of his <em>mental</em>
resources.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">31. 故曰知彼知己勝乃不殆知地知天勝乃可全</p>
<p>Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your
victory will not stand in doubt;</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_113">{113}</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop makes the saying end here, which cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">if you know Heaven and know Earth,</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">天</span> and <span lang="zh">地</span> are transposed for the sake of the jingle between <span lang="zh">天</span> and

has been made from the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">you may make your victory complete.</p>
<p class="annot">As opposed to <span lang="zh">勝之半</span>, above. The original text has <span lang="zh">勝乃不窮</span>, the
corruption being perhaps due to the occurrence of <span lang="zh">不窮</span> in the
preceding sentence. Here, however <span lang="zh">不窮</span> would not be synonymous
with <span lang="zh">不困</span>, but equivalent to <span lang="zh">不可以窮</span> “inexhaustible,” “beyond
computation.” Cf. V. § 11. The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has again supplied the
true reading. Li Ch‘üan sums up as follows: <span lang="zh">人事天時地利三者同知則百戰百勝</span>
“Given a knowledge of three things—the affairs of man, the
seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of earth—, victory
will invariably crown your battles.”</p>

THE NINE SITUATIONS.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">Li Ch‘üan is not quite right in calling these <span lang="zh">勝敵之地</span>. As we shall
see, some of them are highly disadvantageous from the military
point of view. Wang Hsi more correctly says: <span lang="zh">用兵之地利害有九也</span>
“There are nine military situations, good and bad.” One would like
to distinguish the <span lang="zh">九地</span> from the six <span lang="zh">地形</span> of chap. X by saying that
the latter refer to the natural formation or geographical features
of the country, while the <span lang="zh">九地</span> have more to do with the condition
of the army, being <span lang="zh">地勢</span> “situations” as opposed to “grounds.” But
it is soon found impossible to carry out the distinction. Both are
cross-divisions, for among the <span lang="zh">地形</span> we have “temporising ground”
side by side with “narrow passes,” while in the present chapter
there is even greater confusion.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰用兵之法有散地有輕地有爭地有交地有衢地有重地有圮地有圍地有死地</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground: (1)
Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4) open
ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground; (7)
difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 諸侯自戰其地者爲散地</p>
<p>When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive
ground.</p>
<p class="annot">So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and
anxious to see their wives and children, are likely to seize the
opportunity afforded by a battle and scatter in every direction.
“In their advance,” observes Tu Mu, “they will lack the valour of
desperation, and when they retreat, they will find harbours of
refuge.” The <span lang="zh">者</span>, which appears in the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, seems to have been
accidentally omitted in my edition of the standard text.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_115">{115}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">3. 入人之地而不深者爲輕地</p>
<p>When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great
distance, it is facile ground.</p>
<p class="annot">Li Ch‘üan and Ho Shih say <span lang="zh">輕於退也</span> “because of the facility for
retreating,” and the other commentators give similar explanations.
Tu Mu remarks: <span lang="zh">師出越境必焚舟梁示民無返顧之心</span> “When your army has
crossed the border, you should burn your boats and bridges, in
order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering
after home.” I do not think that “disturbing ground,” Capt.
Calthrop’s rendering of <span lang="zh">輕地</span>, has anything to justify it. If an
idiomatic translation is out of the question, one should at least
attempt to be literal.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">4. 我得則利彼得亦利者爲爭地</p>
<p>Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side,
is contentious ground.</p>
<p class="annot">I must apologise for using this word in a sense not known to the
dictionary, i.e. “to be contended for”—Tu Mu’s <span lang="zh">必爭之地</span>. Ts‘ao Kung
says: <span lang="zh">可以少勝衆弱勝强</span> “ground on which the few and the weak can
defeat the many and the strong,” such as <span lang="zh">阨喉</span> “the neck of a pass,”
instanced by Li Ch‘üan. Thus, Thermopylae was a <span lang="zh">爭地</span>, because the
possession of it, even for a few days only, meant holding the
entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time.
Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. <i>ad init.</i>: <span lang="zh">以一擊十莫善於阨</span> “For those who have
to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is nothing better
than a narrow pass.” When <span lang="zh">呂光</span> Lü Kuang was returning from his
triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far
as <span lang="zh">宜禾</span> I-ho, laden with spoils, <span lang="zh">梁熙</span> Liang Hsi, administrator of
<span lang="zh">涼州</span> Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King
of Ch‘in, plotted against him and was for barring his way into the
province. <span lang="zh">楊翰</span> Yang Han, governor of <span lang="zh">高昌</span> Kao-ch‘ang, counselled
him, saying: “Lü Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west,
and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome. If we oppose him in
the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him,
and we must therefore try a different plan. Let us hasten to
occupy the defile at the mouth of the <span lang="zh">高梧</span> Kao-wu pass, thus
cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are
prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without
moving. Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off,
we could make a stand against him at the <span lang="zh">伊吾</span> I-wu pass, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">{116}</span>
nearer. The cunning and resource of <span lang="zh">子房</span> Tzŭ-fang himself [i.e.
<span lang="zh">張良</span>] would be expended in vain against the enormous strength of
these two positions.” Liang Hsi, refusing to act on this advice,
was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader. [See <span lang="zh">晉書</span>, ch. 122,
fol. 3 <i>r</i><sup>o</sup>, and <span lang="zh">歴代紀事年表</span>, ch. 43, fol. 26.]</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">5. 我可以往彼可以來者爲交地</p>
<p>Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.</p>
<p class="annot">This is only a makeshift translation of <span lang="zh">交</span>, which according to
Ts‘ao Kung stands for <span lang="zh">交錯</span> “ground covered with a network of
roads,” like a chess-board. Another interpretation, suggested by
Ho Shih, is <span lang="zh">交通</span> “ground on which intercommunication is easy.” In
either case, it must evidently be <span lang="zh">平原</span> “flat country,” and
therefore <span lang="zh">不可杜絶</span> “cannot be blocked.” Cf. <span lang="zh">通形</span>, X. § 2.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 諸侯之地三屬先至而得天下之衆者爲衢地</p>
<p>Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">我與敵相當而旁有他國也</span> “Our country adjoining the enemy’s and a third
country conterminous with both.” [Ts‘ao Kung.] Mêng Shih instances
the small principality of <span lang="zh">鄭</span> Chêng, which was bounded on the
north-east by <span lang="zh">齊</span> Ch‘i, on the west by <span lang="zh">晉</span> Chin, and on the south by
<span lang="zh">楚</span> Ch‘u.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">天下</span> of course stands for the loose confederacy of states into
which China was divided under the Chou dynasty. The belligerent
who holds this dominating position can constrain most of them to
become his allies. See <i>infra</i>, § 48. <span lang="zh">衆</span> appears at first sight to
be “the masses” or “population” of the Empire, but it is more
probably, as Tu Yu says, <span lang="zh">諸侯之衆</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">is ground of intersecting highways.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop’s “path-ridden ground” might stand well enough for
<span lang="zh">交地</span> above, but it does not bring out the force of <span lang="zh">衢地</span>, which
clearly denotes the central position where important highways meet.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_117">{117}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 入人之地深背城邑多者爲重地</p>
<p>When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country,
leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear,</p>
<p class="annot">After <span lang="zh">多</span>, the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> intercalates the gloss <span lang="zh">難以返</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">it is serious ground.</p>
<p class="annot">Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that <span lang="zh">兵至此者事勢重也</span> “when an
army has reached such a point, its situation is serious.” Li
Ch‘üan instances (1) the victorious march of <span lang="zh">樂毅</span> Yo I into the
capital of Ch‘i in 284 B.C., and (2) the attack on Ch‘u, six years
later, by the Ch‘in general <span lang="zh">白起</span> Po Ch‘i.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 山林險阻沮澤凡難行之道者爲圮地</p>
<p>Mountain forests,</p>
<p class="annot">Or simply, “forests.” I follow the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> in omitting the <span lang="zh">行</span>
before <span lang="zh">山林</span>, given in the standard text, which is not only otiose
but spoils the rhythm of the sentence.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">rugged steeps, marshes and fens—all country that is hard to traverse:
this is difficult ground.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">圮</span> <i>p‘i</i><sup>3</sup> (to be distinguished from <span lang="zh">圯</span> i<sup>4</sup>) is defined by K‘ang
Hsi (after the <cite>Shuo Wên</cite>) as <span lang="zh">毁</span> “to destroy.” Hence Chia Lin
explains <span lang="zh">圮地</span> as ground <span lang="zh">經水所毀</span> “that has been ruined by water
passing over it,” and Tu Yu simply as <span lang="zh">沮洳之地</span> “swampy ground.” But
Ch‘ên Hao says that the word is specially applied to deep
hollows—what Chu-ko Liang, he tells us, used to designate by the
expressive term <span lang="zh">地獄</span> “earth-hells.” Compare the <span lang="zh">天井</span> of IX. § 15.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 所由入者隘所從歸者迂彼寡可以擊吾之衆者爲圍地</p>
<p>Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can
only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy
would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed-in
ground.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 疾戰則存不疾戰則亡者爲死地</p>
<p>Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting
without delay, is desperate ground.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_118">{118}</p>
<p class="annot">The situation, as pictured by Ts‘ao Kung, is very similar to the
<span lang="zh">圍地</span>, except that here escape is no longer possible: <span lang="zh">前有高山後有大水進則不得退則有礙</span>
“A lofty mountain in front, a large river behind,
advance impossible, retreat blocked.” Ch‘ên Hao says: <span lang="zh">人在死地如坐漏船伏燒屋</span>
“to be on ‘desperate ground’, is like sitting in a
leaking boat or crouching in a burning house.” Tu Mu quotes
from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus
entrapped: “Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the
aid of local guides:—it falls into a fatal snare and is at the
enemy’s mercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a
pathway so perilous that the horses have to be roped together
and the chariots carried in slings, no passage open in front,
retreat cut off behind, no choice but to proceed in single
file (<span lang="zh">鴈行魚貫之嚴</span>). Then, before there is time to range our
soldiers in order of battle, the enemy in overwhelming strength
suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take a
breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a
pitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none
of us has a moment’s respite. If we simply maintain our ground,
whole days and months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we
have to sustain the enemy’s attacks on front and rear. The country
is wild, destitute of water and plants; the army is lacking in the
necessaries of life, the horses are jaded and the men worn-out,
all the resources of strength and skill unavailing, the pass so
narrow that a single man defending it can check the onset of ten
thousand; all means of offence in the hands of the enemy, all
points of vantage already forfeited by ourselves:—in this terrible
plight, even though we had the most valiant soldiers and the
keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with the slightest
effect?” Students of Greek history may be reminded of the awful
close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians
under Nicias and Demosthenes. [<i>See</i> Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.].</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 是故散地則無以戰輕地則無止爭地則無攻</p>
<p>On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt
not. On contentious ground, attack not.</p>
<p class="annot">But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the
advantageous position first. So Ts‘ao Kung. Li Ch‘üan and others,
however, suppose the meaning to be that the enemy has already
forestalled us, so that it would be sheer madness to attack. In
the <span lang="zh">孫子敘錄</span>, when the King of Wu inquires what should be done in
this case, Sun Tzŭ replies: “The rule with regard to contentious
ground is that those in possession have the advantage over the
other side. If a position of this kind is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">{119}</span> secured first by the
enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by pretending to
flee—show your banners and sound your drums—make a dash for other
places that he cannot afford to lose—trail brushwood and raise a
dust—confound his ears and eyes—detach a body of your best troops,
and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will sally
forth to the rescue.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 交地則無絶衢地則合交</p>
<p>On open ground, do not try to block the enemy’s way.</p>
<p class="annot">Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking
force itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations of
<span lang="zh">無絶</span>. I follow that of Chang Yü (<span lang="zh">不可以兵阻絶其路</span>). The other
is indicated in Ts‘ao Kung’s brief note: <span lang="zh">相及屬也</span> “Draw closer
together”—<i>i.e.</i>, see that a portion of your own army is not cut
off. Wang Hsi points out that <span lang="zh">交地</span> is only another name for the
<span lang="zh">通地</span> “accessible ground” of X. § 2, and says that the advice here
given is simply a variation of <span lang="zh">利糧道</span> “keep a sharp eye on the line
of supplies,” be careful that your communications are not cut. The
<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> reads <span lang="zh">無相絶</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your
allies.</p>
<p class="annot">Or perhaps, “form alliances with neighbouring states.” Thus Ts‘ao
Kung has: <span lang="zh">結諸侯也</span>. Capt. Calthrop’s “cultivate intercourse” is
much too timid and vague. The original text reads <span lang="zh">交合</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 重地則掠圮地則行</p>
<p>On serious ground, gather in plunder.</p>
<p class="annot">On this, Li Ch‘üan has the following delicious note:
<span lang="zh">深入敵境不可非義失人心如漢高祖入秦無犯婦女無取寳貨得人心也此筌以掠字爲無掠字</span> “When
an army penetrates far into the enemy’s country, care must be
taken not to alienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow
the example of the Han Emperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch‘in
territory was marked by no violation of women or looting of
valuables. [<i>Nota bene</i>: this was in 207 B.C., and may well cause
us to blush for the Christian armies that entered Peking in 1900
A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the present passage, then,
I think that the true reading must be, not <span lang="zh">掠</span> ‘plunder’, but <span lang="zh">無掠</span>
‘do not plunder’.” Alas, I fear that in this instance the worthy
commentator’s feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">{120}</span> at least,
has no such illusions. He says: “When encamped on ‘serious
ground,’ there being no inducement as yet to advance further,
and no possibility of retreat, one ought to take measures for a
protracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides,
and keep a close watch on the enemy.” Cf. also II. § 9: <span lang="zh">因糧於敵</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.</p>
<p class="annot">Or, in the words of VIII. §2, <span lang="zh">無舍</span> “do not encamp.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 圍地則謀死地則戰</p>
<p>On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung says: <span lang="zh">發奇謀</span> “Try the effect of some unusual artifice;”
and Tu Yu amplifies this by saying: <span lang="zh">居此則當權謀詐譎可以免難</span> “In
such a position, some scheme must be devised which will suit the
circumstances, and if we can succeed in deluding the enemy, the
peril may be escaped.” This is exactly what happened on the famous
occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the mountains on
the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by the
Dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle
his foes was remarkably like that which T‘ien Tan had also
employed with success exactly 62 years before. [See IX. § 24,
note.] When night came on, bundles of twigs were fastened to the
horns of some 2000 oxen and set on fire, the terrified animals
being then quickly driven along the mountain side towards the
passes which were beset by the enemy. The strange spectacle of
these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and discomfited the Romans
that they withdrew from their position, and Hannibal’s army passed
safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III. 93, 94; Livy, XXII.
16, 17.]</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On desperate ground, fight.</p>
<p class="annot">For, as Chia Lin remarks: <span lang="zh">力戰或生守隅則死</span> “if you fight with all
your might, there is a chance of life; whereas death is certain if
you cling to your corner.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 所謂古之善用兵者能使敵人前後不相及衆寡不相恃貴賤不相救上下不相扶</p>

<p class="annot">Mei Yao-ch‘ên’s note makes the sense plain: <span lang="zh">或已離而不能合或雖合而</span>

on <span lang="zh">使</span> in § 15.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 合於利而動不合於利而止</p>
<p>When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when

<span lang="zh">然能使敵若此當須有利則動無利則止</span> “Having succeeded in thus

<p class="trans_noindent">I should say: “Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds
dear; then he will be amenable to your will.”</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_122">{122}</p>
<p class="annot">Opinions differ as to what Sun Tzŭ had in mind. Ts‘ao Kung thinks
it is <span lang="zh">其所恃之利</span> “some strategical advantage on which the enemy is
depending.” Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">據我便地畧我田野利其糧道斯三者敵人之所愛惜倚恃者也</span>
“The three things which an enemy is anxious to do, and on
the accomplishment of which his success depends, are: (1) to
capture our favourable positions; (2) to ravage our cultivated
land; (3) to guard his own communications.” Our object then must
be to thwart his plans in these three directions and thus render
him helpless. [Cf. III. § 3.] But this exegesis unduly strains the
meaning of <span lang="zh">奪</span> and <span lang="zh">愛</span>, and I agree with Ch‘ên Hao, who says that
<span lang="zh">所愛</span> does not refer only to strategical advantages, but is any
person or thing that may happen to be of importance to the enemy.
By boldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw
the other side on the defensive.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 兵之情主速乘人之不及由不虞之道攻其所不戒也</p>
<p>Rapidity is the essence of war:</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">兵之情</span> means “the conditions of war,” not, as Capt. Calthrop says,
“the spirit of the troops.” According to Tu Mu, <span lang="zh">此統言兵之情狀</span>
“this is a summary of leading principles in warfare,” and he adds:
<span lang="zh">此乃兵之深情將之至事也</span> “These are the profoundest truths of military
science, and the chief business of the general.” The following
anecdotes, told by Ho Shih, show the importance attached to speed
by two of China’s greatest generals. In 227 A.D., <span lang="zh">孟達</span> Mêng Ta,
governor of <span lang="zh">新城</span> Hsin-ch‘êng under the Wei Emperor Wên Ti, was
meditating defection to the House of Shu, and had entered into
correspondence with Chu-ko Liang, Prime Minister of that State.
The Wei general Ssŭ-ma I was then military governor of <span lang="zh">宛</span> Wan, and
getting wind of Mêng Ta’s treachery, he at once set off with an
army to anticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a
specious message of friendly import. Ssŭ-ma’s officers came to him
and said: “If Mêng Ta has leagued himself with Wu and Shu, the
matter should be thoroughly investigated before we make a move.”
Ssŭ-ma I replied: “Mêng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we ought to
go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and before
he has thrown off the mask.” Then, by a series of forced marches,
he brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch‘êng within the
space of eight days. Now Mêng Ta had previously said in a letter
to Chu-ko Liang: “Wan is 1200 <i>li</i> from here. When the news of
my revolt reaches Ssŭ-ma I, he will at once inform his Imperial
Master, but it will be a whole month before any steps can be
taken, and by that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">{123}</span> time my city will be well fortified. Besides,
Ssŭ-ma I is sure not to come himself, and the generals that will
be sent against us are not worth troubling about.” The next
letter, however, was filled with consternation: “Though only eight
days have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is
already at the city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!” A
fortnight later, Hsin-ch‘êng had fallen and Mêng Ta had lost his
head. [See <cite>Chin Shu</cite>, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li Ching was
sent from <span lang="zh">夔州</span> K‘uei-chou in Ssŭ-ch‘uan to reduce the successful
rebel <span lang="zh">蕭銑</span> Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern
<span lang="zh">荊州</span> Ching-chou Fu In Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being
then in flood, Hsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would
venture to come down through the gorges, and consequently made no
preparations. But Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time,
and was just about to start when the other generals implored him
to postpone his departure until the river was in a less dangerous
state for navigation. Li Ching replied: “To the soldier,
overwhelming speed is of paramount importance, and he must never
miss opportunities. Now is the time to strike, before Hsiao Hsien
even knows that we have got an army together. If we seize the
present moment when the river is in flood, we shall appear before
his capital with startling suddenness, like the thunder which is
heard before you have time to stop your ears against it. [<i>See</i>
VII, § 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if he
gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in
such a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full
fruits of victory will be ours.” All came about as he predicted,
and Hsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that
his people should be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of
death. [See <cite>Hsin T‘ang Shu</cite>, ch. 93, f. 1 <i>v</i><sup>o</sup>.]</p>

contributed to the success of the First Emperor. He had invaded
the Ch‘u State, where a universal levy was made to oppose him.
But, being doubtful of the temper of his troops, he declined all
invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defensive. In
vain did the Ch‘u general try to force a battle: day after day
Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not come out, but
devoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection and
confidence of his men. He took care that they should be well fed,
sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for bathing,
and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them
into a loyal and homogeneous body. After some time had elapsed,
he told off certain persons to find out how the men were amusing
themselves. The answer was, that they were contending with one
another in putting the weight and long-jumping (<span lang="zh">投石超距</span>). When
Wang Chien heard that they were engaged in these athletic
pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been strung up to the
required pitch and that they were now ready for fighting. By this
time the Ch‘u army, after repeating their challenge again and
again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch‘in general
immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the
battle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly
afterwards, the whole of Ch‘u was conquered by Ch‘in, and the king
<span lang="zh">負芻</span> Fu-ch‘u led into captivity. [See <cite>Shih Chi</cite>, ch. 73, f. 5 <i>r</i><sup>o</sup>.

“‘Spells and incantations should be strictly forbidden, and no
officer allowed to inquire by divination into the fortunes of an

The meaning is,” he continues, “that if all doubts and scruples
are discarded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">{127}</span> your men will never falter in their resolution
until they die.” The reading of the standard text is <span lang="zh">無所之</span> “there

prefer to adopt the variant <span lang="zh">災</span>, which evidently stood in Li
Ch‘üan’s text.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">27. 吾士無餘財非惡貨也無餘命非惡壽也</p>
<p>If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because
they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long,
it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü has the best note on this passage:
<span lang="zh">貨與壽人之所愛也所以燒擲財寳割棄性命者非憎惡之也不得已也</span> “Wealth and long life are things for
which all men have a natural inclination. Hence, if they burn or
fling away valuables, and sacrifice their own lives, it is not
that they dislike them, but simply that they have no choice.” Sun
Tzŭ is slyly insinuating that, as soldiers are but human, it is
for the general to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow
rich are not thrown in their way. Capt. Calthrop, mistaking <span lang="zh">惡</span> for
the adjective, has: “not because money is a bad thing ... not
because long life is evil.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">28. 令發之日士卒坐者涕霑襟偃臥者涕交頤投之無所往者諸劌之勇也</p>
<p>On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,</p>

more genuine grief than tears alone.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting

<p class="annot">Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts‘ao Kung says,
<span lang="zh">皆持必死之計</span> “all have embraced the firm resolution to do or
die.” We may remember that the heroes of the Iliad were equally
childlike in showing their emotion. Chang Yü alludes to the
mournful parting at the <span lang="zh">易</span> I River between <span lang="zh">荆軻</span> Ching K‘o and his
friends, when the former was sent to attempt the life of the King
of Ch‘in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C. The tears of all

<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">諸</span> was the personal name of <span lang="zh">專諸</span> Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu

his sovereign <span lang="zh">王僚</span> Wang Liao with a dagger which he secreted in
the belly of a fish served up at a banquet. He succeeded in his
attempt, but was immediately hacked to pieces by the king’s
bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero referred to, <span lang="zh">曹劌</span>
Ts‘ao Kuei (or Ts‘ao <span lang="zh">沫</span> Mo), performed the exploit which has made
his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been
thrice defeated by Ch‘i, and was just about to conclude a treaty
surrendering a large slice of territory, when Ts‘ao Kuei suddenly
seized <span lang="zh">桓公</span> Huan Kung, the Duke of Ch‘i, as he stood on the altar
steps and held a dagger against his chest. None of the Duke’s
retainers dared to move a muscle, and Ts‘ao Kuei proceeded to
demand full restitution, declaring that Lu was being unjustly
treated because she was a smaller and weaker state. Huan Kung, in
peril of his life, was obliged to consent, whereupon Ts‘ao Kuei
flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the
terrified assemblage without having so much as changed colour. As
was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the
bargain, but his wise old counsellor <span lang="zh">管仲</span> Kuan Chung pointed out
to him the impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that
this bold stroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost
in three pitched battles. [For another anecdote of Ts‘ao Kuei see
VII. § 27, note; and for the biographies of these three bravos,
Ts‘ao, Chuan and Ching, see <cite>Shih Chi</cite> ch. 86.]</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a

<p class="annot">The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time
of common peril, how much more should two parts of the same
army, bound together as they are by every tie of interest and
fellow-feeling. Yet it is notorious that many a campaign has been
ruined through lack of co-operation, especially in the case of
allied armies.</p>

<p class="annot">These quaint devices to prevent one’s army from running away
recall the Athenian hero Sôphanes, who carried an anchor with him
at the battle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself
firmly to one spot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough,
says Sun Tzŭ, to render flight impossible by such mechanical
means. You will not succeed unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">{130}</span> your men have tenacity and
unity of purpose, and, above all, a spirit of sympathetic
co-operation. This is the lesson which can be learned from the
<i>shuai-jan</i>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">32. 齊勇若一政之道也</p>
<p>The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of
courage which all must reach.</p>
<p class="annot">Literally, “level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of]
one.” If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it
follows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts
must be of the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a
certain standard. Wellington’s seemingly ungrateful description of
his army at Waterloo as “the worst he had ever commanded” meant no
more than that it was deficient in this important particular—unity
of spirit and courage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections
and carefully kept those troops in the background, he would almost
certainly have lost the day.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">33. 剛柔皆得地之理也</p>
<p>How to make the best of both strong and weak—that is a question
involving the proper use of ground.</p>
<p class="annot">This is rather a hard sentence on the first reading, but the key
to it will be found, firstly, in the pause after <span lang="zh">得</span>, and next, in
the meaning of <span lang="zh">得</span> itself. The best equivalent for this that I
can think of is the German “zur Geltung kommen.” Mei Yao-ch‘ên’s
paraphrase is: <span lang="zh">兵無强弱皆得用者是因地之勢也</span> “The way to eliminate the
differences of strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to
utilise accidental features of the ground.” Less reliable troops,
if posted in strong positions, will hold out as long as better
troops on more exposed terrain. The advantage of position
neutralises the inferiority in stamina and courage. Col. Henderson
says: “With all respect to the text books, and to ordinary
tactical teaching, I am inclined to think that the study of ground
is often overlooked, and that by no means sufficient importance
is attached to the selection of positions ... and to the immense
advantages that are to be derived, whether you are defending or
attacking, from the proper utilisation of natural features.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote180" id="FNanchor180">[180]</a></p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">34. 故善用兵者攜手若使一人不得已也</p>

<p class="annot">Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">喩易也</span> “The simile has reference to the ease with which

<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">靜</span> seems to combine the meanings “noiseless” and “imperturbable,”
both of which attributes would of course conduce to secrecy. Tu Mu
explains <span lang="zh">幽</span> as <span lang="zh">幽深難測</span> “deep and inscrutable,” and <span lang="zh">正</span> as <span lang="zh">平正無偏</span>
“fair and unbiassed.” Mei Yao-ch‘ên alone among the commentators
takes <span lang="zh">治</span> in the sense of <span lang="zh">自治</span> “self-controlled.” <span lang="zh">幽</span> and <span lang="zh">治</span> are
causally connected with <span lang="zh">靜</span> and <span lang="zh">正</span> respectively. This is not brought
out at all in Capt. Calthrop’s rendering: “The general should be
calm, inscrutable, just and prudent.” The last adjective,
moreover, can in no sense be said to represent <span lang="zh">治</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">36. 能愚士卒之耳目使之無知</p>
<p>He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and

a verb in the sense of <span lang="zh">誤</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and thus keep them in total ignorance.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: <span lang="zh">民可與樂成不可與慮始</span>
“The troops must not be allowed to share your schemes
in the beginning; they may only rejoice with you over their happy
outcome.” “To mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy,” is one of
the first principles in war, as has been frequently pointed out.
But how about the other process—the mystification of one’s own
men? Those who may think that Sun Tzŭ is over-emphatic on this
point would do well to read Col. Henderson’s remarks on Stonewall
Jackson’s Valley campaign: “The infinite pains,” he says, “with
which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most trusted staff
officers, his movements, his intentions, and his thoughts, a
commander less thorough would have pronounced useless”—etc.
etc.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote181" id="FNanchor181">[181]</a> In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">{132}</span> of the <cite>Hou
Han Shu</cite>, “Pan Ch‘ao took the field with 25,000 men from Khotan
and other Central Asian states with the object of crushing
Yarkand. The King of Kutcha replied by dispatching his chief
commander to succour the place with an army drawn from the
kingdoms of Wên-su, Ku-mo and Wei-t‘ou, totalling 50,000 men. Pan
Ch‘ao summoned his officers and also the King of Khotan to a
council of war, and said: ‘Our forces are now outnumbered and
unable to make head against the enemy. The best plan, then, is for
us to separate and disperse, each in a different direction. The
King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route, and I will
then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the evening
drum has sounded and then start.’ Pan Ch‘ao now secretly released
the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha was
thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter
set off at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch‘ao’s
retreat in the west, while the King of Wên-su rode eastwards with
8000 horse in order to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as
Pan Ch‘ao knew that the two chieftains had gone, he called his
divisions together, got them well in hand, and at cock-crow
hurled them against the army of Yarkand, as it lay encamped. The
barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion, and were closely
pursued by Pan Ch‘ao. Over 5000 heads were brought back as
trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle
and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating,
Kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces.
From that time forward, Pan Ch‘ao’s prestige completely overawed
the countries of the west.” In this case, we see that the Chinese
general not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real
plans, but actually took the bold step of dividing his army in
order to deceive the enemy.</p>

<p class="annot">This “ground” is cursorily mentioned in VIII. § 2, but it does not
figure among the Nine <span lang="zh">地</span> of this chapter or the Six <span lang="zh">地形</span> in chap.
X. One’s first impulse would be to translate it “distant ground”
(<span lang="zh">絶域</span> is commonly used in the sense of “distant lands”), but this,
if we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant
here. Mei Yao-ch‘ên says it is <span lang="zh">進不及輕退不及散在二地之間也</span> “a position
not far enough advanced to be called ‘facile,’ and not near enough
to home to be called ‘dispersive,’ but something between the two.”
That, of course, does not explain the name <span lang="zh">絶</span>, which seems to imply
that the general has severed his communications and temporarily
cut himself off from his base. Thus, Wang Hsi says: “It is ground
separated from home by an interjacent state, whose territory we
have had to cross in order to reach it. Hence it is incumbent
on us to settle our business there quickly.” He adds that this
position is of rare occurrence, which is the reason why it is not
included among the <span lang="zh">九地</span>. Capt. Calthrop gives but a poor rendering
of this sentence: “To leave home and cross the borders is to be
free from interference.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">When there are means of communication</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> reads <span lang="zh">通</span> for <span lang="zh">達</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways.</p>
<p class="annot">From <span lang="zh">四達</span> down to the end of § 45, we have some of the definitions
of the early part of the chapter repeated in slightly different
language. Capt. Calthrop omits these altogether.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">44. 入深者重地也入淺者輕地也</p>
<p>When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When

<p class="pagenum" id="Page_136">{136}</p>
<p class="annot">This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the
defensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. <i>supra</i>, § 11.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between
all parts of my army.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> has <span lang="zh">其</span> instead of <span lang="zh">之</span>. The present reading is
supported by the <span lang="zh">遺說</span> of Chêng Yu-hsien. As Tu Mu says, the object
is to guard against two possible contingencies: <span lang="zh">一者備其逃逸二者恐其敵至</span>
“(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden attack
on the part of the enemy.” Cf. VII. § 17: <span lang="zh">其徐如林</span>. Mei Yao-ch‘ên
says: <span lang="zh">行則隊校相繼止則營壘聯屬</span> “On the march, the regiments should be
in close touch; in an encampment, there should be continuity
between the fortifications.” He seems to have forgotten, by the
way, what Sun Tzŭ says above: <span lang="zh">輕地則無止</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">47. 爭地吾將趨其後</p>
<p>On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.</p>
<p class="annot">This is Ts‘ao Kung’s interpretation. Chang Yü adopts it, saying:
<span lang="zh">當疾進其後使首尾俱至</span> “We must quickly bring up our rear, so that
head and tail may both reach the goal.” That is, they must not be
allowed to straggle up a long way apart. Mei Yao-ch‘ên offers
another equally plausible explanation: <span lang="zh">敵未至其地我若在後則當疾趨以爭之</span>
“Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and
we are behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to
dispute its possession.” <span lang="zh">其</span> would thus denote the enemy, <span lang="zh">後</span> being
the preposition, and <span lang="zh">趨</span> would retain its usual intransitive sense.
Cf. VII. § 4: <span lang="zh">後人發先人至</span>. Ch‘ên Hao, on the other hand, assuming
that the enemy has had time select his own ground, quotes VI. § 1,
where Sun Tzŭ warns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His
own idea of the situation is rather vaguely expressed:
<span lang="zh">若地利在前先分精銳以據之彼若恃衆來爭我以大衆趨其後無不尅者</span>
“If there is a favourable
position lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to
occupy it; then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to
make a fight for it, <em>you may fall quickly their rear</em> with your
main body, and victory will be assured.” It was thus, he adds,
that Chao Shê beat the army of Ch‘in. [See p. <a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">57</a>.] Li Ch‘üan would
read <span lang="zh">多</span> for <span lang="zh">趨</span>, it is not easy to see why.</p>

<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> reads here <span lang="zh">固其結</span> (see next sentence).</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.</p>
<p class="annot">The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> reads <span lang="zh">謹其市</span>, which Tu Yu explains as “watching
the market towns,” <span lang="zh">變事之端</span> “the hotbeds of revolution.” Capt.
Calthrop translates <span lang="zh">固其結</span> by the same words as <span lang="zh">合交</span> in § 12:
“cultivate intercourse.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">49. 重地吾將繼其食圮地吾將進其塗</p>
<p>On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of
supplies.</p>
<p class="annot">The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder,
not, as one might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home
base. One text, indeed, gives the reading <span lang="zh">掠其食</span>. Cf. § 13. Capt.
Calthrop’s “be careful of supplies” fails to render the force of <span lang="zh">繼</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop’s “do not linger” cannot be called a translation,
but only a paraphrase of the paraphrase offered by Ts‘ao Kung:
<span lang="zh">疾過去也</span> “Pass away from it in all haste.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">50. 圍地吾將塞其闕死地吾將示之以不活</p>
<p>On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">意欲突圍示以守固</span> “To make it seem that I mean to defend the
position, whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through
the enemy’s lines” [Mêng Shih]; <span lang="zh">使士卒必死戰也</span> “in order to make my
soldiers fight with desperation” [Mei Yao-ch‘ên]; <span lang="zh">懼人有走心</span>
“fearing lest my men be tempted to run away” [Wang Hsi]. Tu Mu
points out that this is the converse of VII. § 36, where it is the
enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., <span lang="zh">高歡</span> Kao Huan, afterwards
Emperor and canonised as <span lang="zh">神武</span> Shên-wu, was surrounded by a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">{138}</span>
army under <span lang="zh">爾朱兆</span> Êrh-chu Chao and others. His own force was
comparatively small, consisting only of 2000 horse and something
under 30,000 foot. The lines of investment had not been drawn very
closely together, gaps being left at certain points. But Kao Huan,
instead of trying to escape, actually made a shift to block all
the remaining outlets himself by driving into them a number of
oxen and donkeys roped together. As soon as his officers and men
saw that there was nothing for it but to conquer or die, their
spirits rose to an extraordinary pitch of exaltation, and they
charged with such desperate ferocity that the opposing ranks broke
and crumbled under their onslaught. [See Tu Mu’s commentary, and
<span lang="zh">北齊書</span> ch. 1, fol. 6.]</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness
of saving their lives.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Yu says: <span lang="zh">焚輜重棄糧食塞井夷竈示之無活必殊死戰也</span> “Burn your baggage
and impedimenta, throw away your stores and provisions, choke up
the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and make it plain to your
men that they cannot survive, but must fight to the death.” Mei
Yao-ch‘ên says epigrammatically: <span lang="zh">必死可生</span> “The only chance of life
lies in giving up all hope of it.” This concludes what Sun Tzŭ has
to say about “grounds” and the “variations” corresponding to them.
Reviewing the passages which bear on this important subject, we
cannot fail to be struck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion
in which it is treated. Sun Tzŭ begins abruptly in VIII. § 2 to
enumerate “variations” before touching on “grounds” at all, but
only mentions five, namely nos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent
list, and one that is not included in it. A few varieties of
ground are dealt with in the earlier portion of chap. IX, and then
chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six variations of plan
to match. None of these is mentioned again, though the first
is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next
chapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds <i>par
excellence</i>, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us
down to § 14. In §§ 43–45, fresh definitions are provided for nos.
5, 6, 2, 8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth
ground noticed in chap VIII; and finally, the nine variations
are enumerated once more from beginning to end, all, with the
exception of 5, 6 and 7, being different from those previously
given. Though it is impossible to account for the present state
of Sun Tzŭ’s text, a few suggestive facts may be brought into
prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title, should deal
with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is an
abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine
Grounds. Several these are defined twice over, besides which there
are two distinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The
length of the chapter is disproportionate, being double that of
any other except IX. I do not propose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">{139}</span> to draw any inferences from
these facts, beyond the general conclusion that Sun Tzŭ’s work
cannot have come down to us in the shape in which it left his
hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective and probably out of
place, while XI seems to contain matter that has either been added
by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">51. 故兵之情圍則禦不得已則鬥過則從</p>
<p>For it is the soldier’s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance
when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to
obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">過則從</span> is rendered by Capt. Calthrop: “to pursue the enemy if he
retreat.” But <span lang="zh">過</span> cannot mean “to retreat.” Its primary sense is
to pass over, hence to go too far, to exceed or to err. Here,
however, the word has lost all implication of censure, and appears
to mean “to pass the boundary line dividing safety from danger,”
or, as Chang Yü puts it, <span lang="zh">深陷于危難之地</span> “to be deeply involved in a
perilous position.” The latter commentator alludes to the conduct
of Pan Ch‘ao’s devoted followers in 73 A.D. The story runs thus in
the <cite>Hou Han Shu</cite>, ch. 47, fol. 1 <i>v</i><sup>o</sup>: “When Pan Ch‘ao arrived at
<span lang="zh">鄯善</span> Shan-shan, <span lang="zh">廣</span> Kuang, the King of the country, received him at
first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards
his behaviour underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss
and negligent. Pan Ch‘ao spoke about this to the officers of his
suite: ‘Have you not noticed,’ he said, ‘that Kuang’s polite
intentions are on the wane? This must signify that envoys have
come from the Northern barbarians, and that consequently he is in
a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to throw in his
lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are told,
can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more,
then, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of
the natives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap
for him, saying: ‘Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who
arrived some days ago?’ The man was so taken aback that between
surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan
Ch‘ao, keeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then
summoned a general gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all,
and began drinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their
heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by
addressing them thus: ‘Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an
isolated region, anxious to achieve riches and honour by some
great exploit. Now it happens that an ambassador from the
Hsiung-nu arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the
result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our
royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to
seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-nu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">{140}</span> our bones will
become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?’ With
one accord, the officers replied: ‘<em>Standing as we do in peril of
our lives, we will follow our commander through life and death</em>’
(<span lang="zh">今在危亡之地死生從司馬</span>).” For the sequel of this adventure, see
chap. XII. § 1, note.</p>

Sun Tzŭ might have added that there is always the risk of going
wrong, either through their treachery or some misunderstanding
such as Livy records (XXII. 13): Hannibal, we are told, ordered a
guide to lead him into the neighbourhood of Casinum, where there
was an important pass to be occupied; but his Carthaginian accent,
unsuited to the pronunciation of Latin names, caused the guide to
understand Casilinum instead of Casinum, and turning from his
proper route, he took the army in that direction, the mistake not

reigns covered the period 685–591 B.C.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">54. 夫霸王之兵伐大國則其衆不得聚威加於敵則其交不得合</p>
<p>When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows
itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He
overawes his opponents,</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">and their allies are prevented from joining against him.</p>
<p class="annot">Mei Yao-ch‘ên constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are
so much affected by the Chinese: “In attacking a powerful state,
if you can divide her forces, you will have a superiority in
strength; if you have a superiority in strength, you will overawe
the enemy; if you overawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will
be frightened; and if the neighbouring states are frightened, the
enemy’s allies will be prevented from joining her.” The following
gives a stronger meaning to <span lang="zh">威加</span>: <span lang="zh">若大國一敗則小國離而不聚矣</span> “If the
great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to
summon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and
refrain from massing their forces.” Ch‘ên Hao and Chang Yü take
the sentence in quite another way. The former says: “Powerful
though a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be
unable to raise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on
external aid; if he dispenses with this, and with overweening
confidence in his own strength, simply tries to intimidate the
enemy, he will surely be defeated.” Chang Yü puts his view thus:
“If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will be
discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our
display of military force is inferior by half to that of the
enemy, the other chieftains will take fright and refuse to join
us.” According to this interpretation, <span lang="zh">其</span> would refer, not to the

own secret designs, his prestige enabling him to dispense with

<p class="annot">This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch‘in State
became a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by
which the famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her
final triumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yü, following up his
previous note, thinks that Sun Tzŭ is condemning this attitude of
cold-blooded selfishness and haughty isolation. He again refers <span lang="zh">其</span>
to the warlike prince, thus making it appear that in the end he is
bound to succumb.</p>

I take to mean: “The final instructions you give to your army
should not correspond with those that have been previously posted

<p class="annot">Literally, “do not tell them words;” <i>i.e.</i> do not give your
reasons for any order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague
to “give no reasons” for his decisions, and the maxim is even more
applicable to a general than to a judge. Capt. Calthrop translates
this sentence with beautiful simplicity: “Orders should direct the
soldiers.” That is all.</p>

<p>Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into
desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.</p>
<p class="annot">Compare the paradoxical saying <span lang="zh">亡者存之基死者生之木</span>. These words of
Sun Tzŭ were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of the tactics
he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already alluded
to on p. <a href="#Page_28" class="pginternal">28</a>, In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,
and halted ten miles from the mouth of the <span lang="zh">井陘</span> Ching-hsing pass,
where the enemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight,
he detached a body of 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was
furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">{144}</span> with a red flag. Their instructions were to make their
way through narrow defiles and keep a secret watch on the enemy.
“When the men of Chao see me in full flight,” Han Hsin said, “they
will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This must be the
sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and set
up the red banners of <span lang="zh">漢</span> Han in their stead.” Turning then to
his other officers, he remarked: “Our adversary holds a strong
position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he
sees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear
I should turn back and escape through the mountains.” So saying,
he first of all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and
ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to the
River <span lang="zh">泜</span> Ti. Seeing this manœuvre, the whole army of Chao broke
into loud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and Han
Hsin, displaying the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass
with drums beating, and was immediately engaged by the enemy. A
great battle followed, lasting for some time; until at length Han
Hsin and his colleague <span lang="zh">張耳</span> Chang Ni, leaving drums and banner on
the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where another
fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them and
to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but
the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was
fighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for
the 2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men
of Chao following up their advantage, they galloped behind the
deserted walls, tore up the enemy’s flags and replaced them by
those of Han. When the Chao army turned back from the pursuit, the
sight of these red flags struck them with terror. Convinced that
the Hans had got in and overpowered their king, they broke up in
wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay the panic
being in vain. Then the Han army fell on them from both sides and
completed the rout, killing a great number and capturing the rest,
amongst whom was King <span lang="zh">歇</span> Ya himself.... After the battle, some of
Han Hsin’s officers came to him and said: “In the <cite>Art of War</cite> we
are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river
or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun Tzŭ
and T‘ai Kung. See IX. § 9, and note.] You, on the contrary,
ordered us to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under
these conditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?” The
general replied: “I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of
War with sufficient care. Is it not written there: ‘<em>Plunge your
army into desperate straits and it will come off in safety; place
it in deadly peril and it will survive</em>’? Had I taken the usual
course, I should never have been able to bring my colleagues
round. What says the Military Classic (<span lang="zh">經</span>)?—‘swoop down on the
market-place and drive the men off to fight’ (<span lang="zh">毆市人而戰之</span>). [This
passage does not occur in the present text of Sun Tzŭ.] If I had
not placed my troops in a position where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">{145}</span> they were obliged to
fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow his own
discretion, there would have been a general <i>débandade</i>, and it
would have been impossible to do anything with them.” The officers
admitted the force of his argument, and said: “These are higher
tactics than we should have been capable of.” [See <cite>Ch‘ien Han
Shu</cite>, ch. 34, ff. 4, 5.]</p>

<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung says: <span lang="zh">佯愚也</span> “Feign stupidity”—by an appearance of
yielding and falling in with the enemy’s wishes. Chang Yü’s note
makes the meaning clear: “If the enemy shows an inclination to
advance, lure him on to do so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay
on purpose that he may carry out his intention.” The object is to
make him remiss and contemptuous before we deliver our attack.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">61. 并敵一向千里殺將</p>

sentence to mean: Take the strictest precautions to ensure secrecy
in your deliberations. Capt. Calthrop glides rather too smoothly
over the rough places. His translation is: “conduct the business
of the government with vigilance.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">65. 敵人開闔必亟入之</p>
<p>If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.</p>
<p class="annot">This looks a very simple sentence, yet Ts‘ao Kung is the only
commentator who takes it as I have done. Mêng Shih, followed by
Mei Yao-ch‘ên and Chang Yü, defines <span lang="zh">開闔</span> as <span lang="zh">間者</span> “spies,” and
makes <span lang="zh">入</span> an active verb: “If spies come from the enemy, we must
quickly let them in.” But I cannot find that the words <span lang="zh">開闔</span> have
this meaning anywhere else. On the other hand, they may be taken
as two verbs, <span lang="zh">或開或闔</span>, expressing the enemy’s indecision whether
to advance or retreat, that being the best moment to attack him.
[Cf. <cite>Tao Tê Ching</cite>, chap. X: <span lang="zh">天門開闔能爲雌乎</span>; also <cite>Li Chi</cite>, <span lang="zh">曲禮</span>,
I. ii. 25.] It is not easy to choose between this and Ts‘ao Kung’s
explanation; the fact that <span lang="zh">敵人開戸</span> occurs shortly afterwards, in §
68, might be adduced in support of either. <span lang="zh">必</span> must be understood in
the sense of <span lang="zh">宜</span> or <span lang="zh">當</span>. The only way to avoid this is to put <span lang="zh">開闔</span>
between commas and translate: “If we leave a door open, the enemy
is sure to rush in.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">66. 先其所愛微與之期</p>
<p>Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. <i>supra</i>, § 18.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop hardly attempts to translate this difficult
paragraph, but invents the following instead: “Discover what he
most values, and plan to seize it.” Ch‘ên Hao’s explanation,
however, is clear enough:
<span lang="zh">我若先奪便地而敵不至雖有其利亦奚用之是以欲取其愛惜之處必先微與敵人相期誤之使必至</span>
“If I manage to seize a favourable
position, but the enemy does not appear on the scene, the
advantage thus obtained cannot be turned to any practical account.
He who intends, therefore, to occupy a position of importance
to the enemy, must begin by making an artful appointment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">{148}</span> so to
speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him into going there as
well.” Mei Yao-ch‘ên explains that this “artful appointment” is
to be made through the medium of the enemy’s own spies, who will
carry back just the amount of information that we choose to give
them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, <span lang="zh">我後人發先人至</span>
“we must manage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before
him” (VII. § 4). We must start after him in order to ensure his
marching thither; we must arrive before him in order to capture
the place without trouble. Taken thus, the present passage lends
some support to Mei Yao-ch‘ên’s interpretation of § 47.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">67. 踐墨隨敵以決戰事</p>
<p>Walk in the path defined by rule,</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">墨</span> stands <span lang="zh">繩墨</span> “a marking-line,” hence a rule of conduct. See
Mencius VII. 1. xli. 2. Ts‘ao Kung explains it by the similar
metaphor <span lang="zh">規矩</span> “square and compasses.” The baldness of the sentiment
rather inclines me to favour the reading <span lang="zh">剗</span> adopted by Chia Lin in
place of <span lang="zh">踐</span>, which yields an exactly opposite sense, namely:
“Discard hard and fast rules.” Chia Lin says: <span lang="zh">惟勝是利不可守以繩墨而爲</span>
“Victory is the only thing that matters, and this cannot be
achieved by adhering to conventional canons.” It is unfortunate
that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the sense
yielded is certainly much more satisfactory. Napoleon, as we know,
according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated, won
his battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive
battle.</p>
<p class="annot">The last four words of the Chinese are omitted by Capt. Calthrop.
Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">隨敵人之形若有可乘之勢則出而決戰</span> “Conform to the enemy’s
tactics until a favourable opportunity offers; then come forth and

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">68. 是故始如處女敵人開戶後如脫兎敵不及拒</p>

<p class="pagenum" id="Page_149">{149}</p>
<p class="annot">As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity, the comparison
hardly appears felicitous. But of course Sun Tzŭ was thinking only
of its speed. The words have been taken to mean: You must flee
from the enemy as quickly as an escaping hare; but this is rightly
rejected by Tu Mu. Capt. Calthrop is wrong in translating <span lang="zh">兎</span>
“rabbit.” Rabbits are not indigenous to China, and were certainly
not known there in the 6th century B.C. The last sixteen
characters evidently form a sort of four-line jingle. Chap. X, it
may be remembered, closed in similar fashion.</p>

THE ATTACK BY FIRE.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot">Rather more than half the chapter (§§ 1–13) is devoted to the subject
of fire, after which the author branches off into other topics.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰凡火攻有五一曰火人二曰火積三曰火輜四曰火庫五曰火隊</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first
is to burn soldiers in their camp;</p>
<p class="annot">So Tu Mu. Li Ch‘üan says: <span lang="zh">焚其營殺其士卒也</span> “Set fire to the camp,
and kill the soldiers” (when they try to escape from the flames).
Pan Ch‘ao, sent on a diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan
[see XI. § 51, note], found himself placed in extreme peril by
the unexpected arrival of an envoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal
enemies of the Chinese]. In consultation with his officers, he
exclaimed: “‘Never venture, never win!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote183" id="FNanchor183">[183]</a> The only course open
to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under
cover of night, when they will not be able to discern our numbers.
Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them completely;
this will cool the King’s courage and cover us with glory, besides
ensuring the success of our mission.’ The officers all replied
that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the
Intendant (<span lang="zh">從事</span>). Pan Ch‘ao then fell into a passion: ‘It is
to-day,’ he cried, ‘that our fortunes must be decided! The
Intendant is only a humdrum civilian, who on hearing of our
project will certainly be afraid, and everything will be brought
to light. An inglorious death is no worthy fate for valiant
warriors.’ All then agreed to do as he wished. Accordingly, as
soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly made their
way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the time.
Pan Ch‘ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind
the enemy’s barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames
shoot up, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">{151}</span> should begin drumming and yelling with all their
might. The rest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he
posted in ambuscade at the gate of the camp. He then set fire to
the place from the windward side, whereupon a deafening noise of
drums and shouting arose on the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu,
who rushed out pell-mell in frantic disorder. Pan Ch‘ao slew three
of them with his own hand, while his companions cut off the heads
of the envoy and thirty of his suite. The remainder, more than a
hundred in all, perished in the flames. On the following day, Pan
Ch‘ao went back and informed <span lang="zh">郭恂</span> Kuo Hsün [the Intendant] of what
he had done. The latter was greatly alarmed and turned pale.
But Pan Ch‘ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted hand:
‘Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,
Sir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.’ This satisfied Kuo
Hsün, and Pan Ch‘ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan,
showed him the head of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was
seized with fear and trembling, which Pan Ch‘ao took steps to
allay by issuing a public proclamation. Then, taking the king’s
son as hostage, he returned to make his report to <span lang="zh">竇固</span> Tou Ku.”
[<cite>Hou Han Shu</cite>, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.]</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the second is to burn stores;</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">糧食薪芻</span> “Provisions, fuel and fodder.” In order to
subdue the rebellious population of Kiangnan, <span lang="zh">高潁</span> Kao Kêng
recommended Wên Ti of the Sui dynasty to make periodical raids and
burn their stores of grain, a policy which in the long run proved
entirely successful. [<span lang="zh">隋書</span>, ch. 41, fol. 2.]</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the third is to burn baggage-trains;</p>
<p class="annot">An example given is the destruction of <span lang="zh">袁紹</span> Yüan Shao’s waggons and
impedimenta by Ts‘ao Ts‘ao in 200 A.D.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says that the things contained in <span lang="zh">輜</span> and <span lang="zh">庫</span> are the same. He
specifies weapons and other implements, bullion and clothing. Cf.
VII. § 11.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">No fewer than four totally diverse explanations of this sentence
are given by the commentators, not one of which is quite
satisfactory. It is obvious, at any rate, that the ordinary
meaning of <span lang="zh">隊</span> (“regiment” or “company”) is here inadmissible. In
spite of Tu Mu’s note, <span lang="zh">焚其行伍因亂而擊之</span>, I must regard “company
burning” (Capt. Calthrop’s rendering) as nonsense pure and simple.
We may also, I think, reject the very forced explanation given
by Li Ch‘üan, Mei Yao-ch‘ên<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">{152}</span> and Chang Yü, of whom the last-named
says: <span lang="zh">焚其隊仗使兵無戰具</span> “burning a regiment’s weapons, so that the
soldiers may have nothing to fight with.” That leaves only two
solutions open: one, favoured by Chia Lin and Ho Shih, is to take
<span lang="zh">隊</span> in the somewhat uncommon sense of “a road,” = <span lang="zh">隧</span>. The commentary
on a passage in the <span lang="zh">穆天子傳</span>, quoted in <cite>K‘ang Hsi</cite>, defines <span lang="zh">隊</span>
(read <i>sui</i>) as <span lang="zh">谷中險阻道</span> “a difficult road leading through a
valley.” Here it would stand for the <span lang="zh">糧道</span> “line of supplies,” which
might be effectually interrupted if the country roundabout was
laid waste with fire. Finally, the interpretation which I have
adopted is that given by Tu Yu in the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>. He reads <span lang="zh">墜</span>
(which is not absolutely necessary, <span lang="zh">隊</span> <i>chui</i> being sometimes used
in the same sense), with the following note: <span lang="zh">以火墮敵營中也火墜之法以鐵籠火着箭頭頸强弩射敵營中</span>
“To drop fire into the enemy’s camp. The
method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows
alight by dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from
powerful crossbows into the enemy’s lines.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">2. 行火必有因煙火必素具</p>
<p>In order to carry out an attack with fire, we must have means available.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung thinks that <span lang="zh">姦人</span> “traitors in the enemy’s camp” are
referred to. He thus takes <span lang="zh">因</span> as the efficient cause only. But
Ch‘ên Hao is more likely to be right in saying: <span lang="zh">須得其便不獨姦人</span> “We
must have favourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors
to help us.” Chia Lin says: <span lang="zh">因風燥</span> “We must avail ourselves of wind
and dry weather.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">煙火</span> is explained by Ts‘ao Kung as <span lang="zh">燒具</span> “appliances for making

forth in § 1. What follows has certainly nothing to do with these.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">6. 火發於內則早應之於外</p>
<p>(1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy’s camp, respond at once</p>

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">7. 火發而其兵靜者待而勿攻</p>
<p>(2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy’s soldiers remain
quiet, bide your time and do not attack.</p>
<p class="annot">The original text omits <span lang="zh">而其</span>. The prime object of attacking with
fire is to throw the enemy into confusion. If this effect is not
produced, it means that the enemy is ready to receive us. Hence
the necessity for caution.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">8. 極其火力可從而從之不可從而止</p>
<p>(3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up
with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung says: <span lang="zh">見可而進知難而退</span> “If you see a possible way,
advance; but if you find the difficulties too great, retire.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">9. 火可發於外無待於內以時發之</p>
<p>(4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do
not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a
favourable moment.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire
breaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the
agency of incendiaries) inside the enemy’s camp. “But,” he
continues, <span lang="zh">若敵居荒澤草穢或營栅可焚之地卽須及時發火不必更待內發作然後應之恐敵人自燒野草我起火無益</span>
“if the enemy is settled in a waste place
littered with quantities of grass, or if he has pitched his camp
in a position which can be burnt out, we must carry our fire
against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not wait on in
hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our opponents
should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and thus
render our own attempts fruitless.” The famous <span lang="zh">李陵</span> Li Ling once
baffled the <span lang="zh">單于</span> leader of the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter,
taking advantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the
Chinese general’s camp, but found that every scrap of combustible
vegetation in the neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On
the other hand, <span lang="zh">波才</span> Po-ts‘ai, a general of the <span lang="zh">黃巾賊</span> Yellow
Turban rebels, was badly defeated in 184 A.D. through his neglect
of this simple precaution. “At the head of a large army he was
besieging <span lang="zh">長社</span> Ch‘ang-shê, which was held by <span lang="zh">皇甫嵩</span> Huang-fu Sung.
The garrison was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">{155}</span> small, and a general feeling of nervousness
pervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together
and said: ‘In war, there are various indirect methods of attack,
and numbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here
quotes Sun Tzŭ, V. §§ 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched
their camp in the midst of thick grass (<span lang="zh">依草結營</span>), which will
easily burn when the wind blows. If we set fire to it at night,
they will be thrown into a panic, and we can make a sortie and
attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the achievement
of T‘ien Tan.’ [See p. <a href="#Page_90" class="pginternal">90</a>.] That same evening, a strong breeze
sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds
together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after
which he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their
way through the lines and started the fire with loud shouts
and yells. Simultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the
city-walls, and Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid
charge, which threw the rebels into confusion and put them to
headlong flight.” [<cite>Hou Han Shu</cite>, ch. 71, f. 2 <i>r</i><sup>o</sup>.]</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">10. 火發上風無攻下風</p>
<p>(5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from
the leeward.</p>
<p class="annot">Chang Yü, following Tu Yu, says: <span lang="zh">燒之必退退而逆擊之必死戰則不便也</span> “When
you make a fire, the enemy will retreat away from it; if you
oppose his retreat and attack him then, he will fight desperately,
which will not conduce to your success.” A rather more obvious
explanation is given by Tu Mu: “If the wind is in the east, begin
burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the attack
yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side,
and then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as
your enemy.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 晝風久夜風止</p>
<p>A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon
falls.</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. Lao Tzŭ’s saying: <span lang="zh">飄風不終朝</span> “A violent wind does not last the
space of a morning.” (<cite>Tao Tê Ching</cite>, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch‘ên and
Wang Hsi say: “A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night
breeze at daybreak. This is what happens as a general rule.” The
phenomenon observed may be correct enough, but how this sense is
to be obtained is not apparent.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 凡軍必知有五火之變以數守之</p>
<p>In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be
known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the
proper days.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_156">{156}</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu’s commentary shows what has to be supplied in order to make
sense out of <span lang="zh">以數守之</span>. He says: <span lang="zh">須筭星𨇠之數守風起之日乃可發火</span> “We
must make calculations as to the paths of the stars, and watch for
the days on which wind will rise, before making our attack with
fire.” Chang Yü seems to take <span lang="zh">守</span> in the sense of <span lang="zh">防</span>: “We must not
only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also be on
our guard against similar attacks from them.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 故以火佐攻者明以水佐攻者强</p>
<p>Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;</p>
<p class="annot">I have not the least hesitation in rejecting the commentators’
explanation of <span lang="zh">明</span> as = <span lang="zh">明白</span>. Thus Chang Yü says: <span lang="zh">灼然可以取勝</span> “...
will <em>clearly</em> [i.e. obviously] be able to gain the victory.” This
is not only clumsy in itself, but does not balance <span lang="zh">强</span> in the next
clause. For <span lang="zh">明</span> “intelligent,” cf. <i>infra</i>, § 16, and <cite>Lun Yü</cite> XII. 6.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of
strength.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop gives an extraordinary rendering of the paragraph:
“... if the attack is to be assisted, the fire must be
unquenchable. If water is to assist the attack, the flood must be
overwhelming.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 水可以絶不可以奪</p>
<p>By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all
his belongings.</p>
<p class="annot">Ts‘ao Kung’s note is: <span lang="zh">但可以絶敵道分敵軍不可以奪敵蓄積</span> “We can merely
obstruct the enemy’s road or divide his army, but not sweep away
all his accumulated stores.” Water can do useful service, but it
lacks the terrible destructive power of fire. This is the reason,
Chang Yü concludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple of
sentences, whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail. Wu
Tzŭ (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements: <span lang="zh">居軍下濕水無所通霖雨數至可灌而沉居軍荒澤草楚幽穢風飆數至可焚而滅</span> “If an army is encamped on
low-lying marshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and
where the rainfall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood. If an
army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds
and brambles, and visited by frequent gales, it may be
exterminated by fire.”</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_157">{157}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 夫戰勝攻取而不修其功者凶命曰費留</p>
<p>Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in
his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the
result is waste of time and general stagnation.</p>
<p class="annot">This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzŭ. The
difficulty lies mainly in <span lang="zh">不修其功</span>, of which two interpretations
appear possible. Most of the commentators understand <span lang="zh">修</span> in the
sense (not known to <cite>K‘ang Hsi</cite>) of <span lang="zh">賞</span> “reward” or <span lang="zh">舉</span> “promote,”
and <span lang="zh">其功</span> as referring to the merit of officers and men. Thus Ts‘ao
Kung says: <span lang="zh">賞善不踰日</span> “Rewards for good service should not be
deferred a single day.” And Tu Mu: “If you do not take opportunity
to advance and reward the deserving, your subordinates will not
carry out your commands, and disaster will ensue.” <span lang="zh">費留</span> would then
probably mean <span lang="zh">留滯費耗</span> “stoppage of expenditure,” or as Chia Lin
puts it, <span lang="zh">惜費</span> “the grudging of expenditure.” For several reasons,
however, and in spite of the formidable array of scholars on the
other side, I prefer the interpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch‘ên
alone, whose words I will quote:
<span lang="zh">欲戰必勝攻必取者在因時乘便能作爲功也作爲功者修火攻水攻之類不可坐守其利也坐守其利者凶也</span>
“Those who want to make
sure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the
favourable moments when they come and not shrink on occasion from
heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to such means of
attack as fire, water and the like. What they must not do, and
what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold on to the
advantages they have got.” This retains the more usual meaning of
<span lang="zh">修</span>, and also brings out a clear connection of thought with the
previous part of the chapter. With regard to <span lang="zh">費留</span>, Wang Hsi
paraphrases it as <span lang="zh">費財老師</span> “expending treasure and tiring out
[<i>lit</i>., ageing] the army.” <span lang="zh">費</span> of course is expenditure or waste
in general, either of time, money or strength. But the soldier is
less concerned with the saving of money than of time. For the
metaphor expressed in “stagnation” I am indebted to Ts‘ao Kung,
who says: <span lang="zh">若水之留不復還也</span>. Capt. Calthrop gives a rendering which
bears but little relation to the Chinese text: “unless victory or
possession be obtained, the enemy quickly recovers, and
misfortunes arise. The war drags on, and money is spent.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">16. 故曰明主慮之良將修之</p>
<p>Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the
good general cultivates his resources.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_158">{158}</p>
<p class="annot">As Sun Tzŭ quotes this jingle in support of his assertion in § 15,
we must suppose <span lang="zh">修之</span> to stand for <span lang="zh">修其功</span> or something analogous.
The meaning seems to be that the ruler lays plans which the
general must show resourcefulness in carrying out. It is now
plainer than ever that <span lang="zh">修</span> cannot mean “to reward.” Nevertheless, Tu
Mu quotes the following from the <span lang="zh">三略</span>, ch. 2:
<span lang="zh">霸者制士以權結士以信使士以賞信衰則士疏賞虧則士不用命</span>
“The warlike prince controls his
soldiers by his authority, knits them together by good faith, and
by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays, there will be
disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not be
respected.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">17. 非利不動非得不用非危不戰</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not
unless the position is critical.</p>
<p class="annot">Sun Tzŭ may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes
so far in that direction as the remarkable passage in the <cite>Tao Tê
Ching</cite>, ch. 69: <span lang="zh">吾不敢爲主而爲客不敢進寸而退尺</span> “I dare not take the
initiative, but prefer to act on the defensive; I dare not advance
an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">18. 主不可以怒而興師將不可以愠而致戰</p>
<p>No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own
spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.</p>
<p class="annot">Again compare Lao Tzŭ, ch. 68: <span lang="zh">善戰者不怒</span>. Chang Yü says that <span lang="zh">愠</span> is
a weaker word than <span lang="zh">怒</span>, and is therefore applied to the general as
opposed to the sovereign. The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> read <span lang="zh">軍</span>
for <span lang="zh">師</span>, and the latter <span lang="zh">合</span> for <span lang="zh">致</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">19. 合於利而動不合於利而止</p>
<p>If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where
you are.</p>
<p class="annot">This is repeated from XI. § 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an
interpolation, for it is evident that § 20 ought to follow immediately
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">{159}</span> § 18. For <span lang="zh">動</span>, the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> have <span lang="zh">用</span>. Capt. Calthrop
invents a sentence which he inserts before this one: “Do not make war
unless victory may be gained thereby.” While he was about it, he might
have credited Sun Tzŭ with something slightly less inane.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">20. 怒可以復喜愠可以復悅</p>
<p>Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by
content.</p>
<p class="annot">According to Chang Yü, <span lang="zh">喜</span> denotes joy outwardly manifested in the
countenance, <span lang="zh">悅</span> the inward sensation of happiness.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">21. 亡國不可以復存死者不可以復生</p>
<p>But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into

<p>Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of
caution.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">警</span>, which usually means “to warn,” is here equal to <span lang="zh">戒</span>. This is a
good instance of how Chinese characters, which stand for ideas,

Shu</cite> reads <span lang="zh">故曰</span>, as in § 16.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.</p>
<p class="annot">It is odd that <span lang="zh">全軍</span> should not have the same meaning here as in
III. § 1, <i>q.v.</i> This has led me to consider whether it might not
be possible to take the earlier passage thus: “to preserve your
own army (country, regiment, etc.) intact is better than to
destroy the enemy’s.” The two words do not appear in the <cite>T‘ung
Tien</cite> or the <cite>Yü Lan</cite>. Capt. Calthrop misses the point by
translating: “then is the state secure, and the army victorious in
battle.”</p>

THE USE OF SPIES.</h2>
</div>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">間</span> is really a vulgar form of <span lang="zh">閒</span>; and does not appear in the <cite>Shuo
Wên</cite>. In practice, however, it has gradually become a distinct
character with special meanings of its own, and I have therefore
followed my edition of the standard text in retaining this form
throughout the chapter. In VI. § 25, on the other hand, the
correct form <span lang="zh">閒</span> will be found. The evolution of the meaning “spy”
is worth considering for a moment, provided it be understood that
this is very doubtful ground, and that any dogmatism is out of
place. The <cite>Shuo Wên</cite> defines <span lang="zh">閒</span> as <span lang="zh">隟</span> (the old form of 𨻶) “a
crack” or “chink,” and on the whole we may accept <span lang="zh">徐鍇</span> Hsü Ch‘ieh’s
analysis as not unduly fanciful: <span lang="zh">夫門夜閉閉而見月光是有閒隟也</span> “At
night, a <em>door</em> is shut; if, when it is shut, the light of the
<em>moon</em> is visible, it must come through a <em>chink</em>.” From this
it is an easy step to the meaning “space between,” or simply
“between,” as for example in the phrase <span lang="zh">往來閒諜</span> “to act as a
secret spy between enemies.” Here <span lang="zh">諜</span> is the word which means “spy;”
but we may suppose that constant association so affected the
original force of <span lang="zh">閒</span>, that <span lang="zh">諜</span> could at last be dropped altogether,
leaving <span lang="zh">閒</span> to stand alone with the same signification. Another
possible theory is that the word may first have come to mean <span lang="zh">覗</span> “to
peep” (see <span lang="zh">博雅</span>, quoted in <cite>K‘ang Hsi</cite>) which would naturally be
suggested by “crack” or “crevice,” and afterwards the man who
peeps, or spy.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">1. 孫子曰凡興師十萬出兵千里百姓之費公家之奉日費千金內外騷動怠於道路不得操事者七十萬家</p>
<p>Sun Tzŭ said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching
them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on
the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a
thousand ounces of silver.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_161">{161}</p>
<p class="annot">Cf. II. §§ 1, 13, 14.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down
exhausted on the highways.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">怠於道路</span>, which is omitted by the <cite>Yü Lan</cite>, appears at first sight
to be explained by the words immediately following, so that the
obvious translation would be “(enforced) idleness along the line
of march.” [Cf. <cite>Tao Tê Ching</cite>, ch. 30: <span lang="zh">師之所處荆棘生焉</span> “Where
troops have been quartered, brambles and thorns spring up.”] The
commentators, however, say that <span lang="zh">怠</span> is here equivalent to <span lang="zh">疲</span>—a
meaning which is still retained in the phrase <span lang="zh">倦怠</span>. Tu Mu refers <span lang="zh">怠</span>
to those who are engaged in conveying provisions to the army. But
this can hardly be said to emerge clearly from Sun Tzŭ’s text.
Chang Yü has the note: “We may be reminded of the saying: ‘On
serious ground, gather in plunder’ [XI. § 13]. Why then should
carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highways?—The
answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of munitions of
war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the injunction to
‘forage on the enemy’ only means that when an army is deeply
engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided
against. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for
corn, we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted
flow of supplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts
(<span lang="zh">磧鹵之地</span>), where provisions being unobtainable, supplies from home
cannot be dispensed with.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their
labour.</p>
<p class="annot">Mei Yao-ch‘ên says: <span lang="zh">廢於耒耜</span> “Men will be lacking at the
plough-tail.” The allusion is to <span lang="zh">井田</span> the system of dividing land
into nine parts, as shown in the character <span lang="zh">井</span>, each consisting
of a <span lang="zh">夫</span> or <span lang="zh">頃</span> (about 15 acres), the plot in the centre being
cultivated on behalf of the State by the tenants of the other
eight. It was here also, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages
were built and a well sunk, to be used by all in common. [See II.
§ 12, note.] These groups of eight peasant proprietors were called
<span lang="zh">鄰</span>. In time of war, one of the families had to serve in the army,
while the other seven contributed to its support (<span lang="zh">一家從軍七家奉弓</span>).
Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men (reckoning one able-bodied soldier
to each family) the husbandry of 700,000 families would be affected.</p>

<p>Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">{162}</span> for the
victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain
in ignorance of the enemy’s condition simply because one grudges
the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments,</p>
<p class="annot">“For spies” is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the
effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually
mentioned at this point.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">is the height of inhumanity.</p>
<p class="annot">Sun Tzŭ’s argument is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting
to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure
which war always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept
informed of the enemy’s condition, and are ready to strike at the
right moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get
this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to
obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their
services. But it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively
trifling amount for this purpose, when every day that the war
lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum. This grievous burden
falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun Tzŭ concludes
that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime
against humanity.</p>

<p>Having <em>inward spies</em>, making use of officials of the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">官</span> includes both civil and military officials. Tu Mu enumerates the
following classes as likely to do good service in this respect:
“Worthy men who have been degraded from office, criminals who have
undergone punishment; also, favourite concubines who are greedy
for gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions,
or who have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others
who are anxious that their side should be defeated in order that
they may have a chance of displaying their ability and talents,
fickle turncoats who always want to have a foot in each boat
(<span lang="zh">飜覆變詐常持兩端之心者</span>). Officials of these several kinds,” he
continues, “should be secretly approached and bound to one’s
interests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able
to find out the state of affairs in the enemy’s country, ascertain
the plans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb
the harmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his
ministers.” The necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing
with “inward spies,” appears from an historical incident related
by Ho Shih: “<span lang="zh">羅尙</span> Lo Shang, Governor of <span lang="zh">益州</span> I-chou, sent his
general <span lang="zh">隗伯</span> Wei Po to attack the rebel <span lang="zh">李雄</span> Li Hsiung of <span lang="zh">蜀</span> Shu in
his stronghold at <span lang="zh">郫</span> P‘i. After each side had experienced a number
of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse to the services
of a certain <span lang="zh">朴泰</span> P‘o-t‘ai, a native of <span lang="zh">武都</span> Wu-tu. He began by
having him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to
Lo Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to co-operate with him
from inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right
moment for making a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these
promises, marched out all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and
others at their head with orders to attack at P‘o-t‘ai’s bidding.
Meanwhile, Li Hsiung’s general, <span lang="zh">李驤</span> Li Hsiang, had prepared an
ambuscade on their line of march; and P‘o-t‘ai, having reared
long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the
beacon-fire. Wei Po’s men raced up on seeing the signal and began
climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while others were
drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred of Lo
Shang’s soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom
was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his
forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy
completely.” [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho
Shih got the story from. It is not given in the biography of Li
Hsiung or that of his father Li <span lang="zh">特</span> T‘ê, <cite>Chin Shu</cite>, ch. 120, 121.]</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_166">{166}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">11. 反間者因其敵間而用之</p>
<p>Having <em>converted spies</em>, getting hold of the enemy’s spies and using
them for our own purposes.</p>
<p class="annot">By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them
from the enemy’s service, and inducing them to carry back false
information as well as to spy in turn on their own countrymen.
Thus Tu Yu: <span lang="zh">因厚賂重許反使爲我間也</span>. On the other hand, <span lang="zh">蕭世誠</span> Hsiao
Shih-hsien in defining the <span lang="zh">反間</span> says that we pretend not to
have detected him, but contrive to let him carry away a false
impression of what is going on (<span lang="zh">敵使人來候我我佯不知而示以虚事</span>).
Several of the commentators accept this as an alternative
definition; but that it is not what Sun Tzŭ meant is conclusively
proved by his subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy
generously (§ 21 <i>sqq</i>.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which
converted spies were used with conspicuous success: 1) by T‘ien
Tan in his defence of Chi-mo (see <i>supra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_90" class="pginternal">90</a>); 2) by Chao Shê
on his march to O-yü (see p. <a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">57</a>); and by the wily <span lang="zh">范雎</span> Fan Chü
in 260 B.C., when Lien P‘o was conducting a defensive campaign
against Ch‘in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved of Lien P‘o’s
cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to avert a
series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to the
reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and
were already in Fan Chü’s pay. They said: “The only thing which
causes Ch‘in anxiety is lest <span lang="zh">趙括</span> Chao Kua should be made general.
Lien P‘o they consider an easy opponent, who is sure to be
vanquished in the long run.” Now this Chao Kua was a son of the
famous Chao Shê. From his boyhood, he had been wholly engrossed
in the study of war and military matters, until at last he came
to believe that there was no commander in the whole Empire who
could stand against him. His father was much disquieted by this
overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he spoke of such
a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if ever Kua was
appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of Chao. This
was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own mother
and the veteran statesman <span lang="zh">藺相如</span> Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to
succeed Lien P‘o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the
redoubtable Po Ch‘i and the great military power of Ch‘in. He
fell into a trap by which his army was divided into two and his
communications cut; and after a desperate resistance lasting 46
days, during which the famished soldiers devoured one another, he
was himself killed by an arrow, and his whole force, amounting,
it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put to the sword. [See

<p class="ctext" lang="zh">12. 死間者爲誑事於外令吾間知之而傳於敵</p>
<p>Having <em>doomed spies</em>, doing certain things openly for purposes of
deception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them
to the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">傳</span> is Li Ch‘üan’s conjecture for <span lang="zh">待</span>, which is found in the <cite>T‘ung
Tien</cite> and the <cite>Yü Lan</cite>. The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite>, unsupported by any good
authority, adds <span lang="zh">間也</span> after <span lang="zh">敵</span>. In that case, the doomed spies would
be those of the enemy, to whom our own spies had conveyed false
information. But this is unnecessarily complicated. Tu Yu gives
the best exposition of the meaning: “We ostentatiously do things
calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe
that they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies
are captured in the enemy’s lines, they will make an entirely
false report, and the enemy will take measures accordingly, only
to find that we do something quite different. The spies will
thereupon be put to death.” Capt. Calthrop makes a hopeless muddle
of the sentence. As an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions
the prisoners released by Pan Ch‘ao in his campaign against
Yarkand. (See p. <a href="#Page_132" class="pginternal">132</a>.) He also refers to <span lang="zh">唐儉</span> T‘ang Chien, who
in 630 A.D. was sent by T‘ai Tsung to lull the Turkish Khan <span lang="zh">頡利</span>
Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able to deliver
a crushing blow against him. Chang Yü says that the Turks revenged
themselves by killing T‘ang Chien, but this is a mistake, for we
read in both the Old and the New T‘ang History (ch. 58, fol. 2 and
ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on until
656. <span lang="zh">酈食其</span> Li I-chi<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote185" id="FNanchor185">[185]</a> played a somewhat similar part in 203
B.C., when sent by the King of Han to open peaceful negotiations
with Ch‘i. He has certainly more claim to be described as a <span lang="zh">死間</span>;
for the King of Ch‘i, being subsequently attacked without warning
by Han Hsin, and infuriated by what he considered the treachery of
Li I-chi, ordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">13. 生間者反報也</p>
<p><em>Surviving spies</em>, finally, are those who bring back news from the
enemy’s camp.</p>
<p class="annot">This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a
regular part of the army. Tu Mu says: <span lang="zh">生間者必取內明外愚形劣心壯趫健勁勇閑於鄙事能忍饑寒垢耻者爲之</span>
“Your surviving spy must be a man of
keen intellect, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">{168}</span> in outward appearance a fool; of shabby
exterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust,
endowed with physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed
to all sorts of dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to
put up with shame and ignominy.” Ho Shih tells the following story
of <span lang="zh">達奚武</span> Ta-hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty: “When he was governor of
Eastern Ch‘in, <span lang="zh">神武</span> Shên-wu of Ch‘i made a hostile movement upon
<span lang="zh">沙苑</span> Sha-yüan. The Emperor T‘ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu to
spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other men. All three
were on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it was dark,
they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp and
stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching
the passwords used by the army. Then they got on their horses
again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of
nightwatchmen (<span lang="zh">警夜者</span>); and more than once, happening to come
across a soldier who was committing some breach of discipline,
they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgelling! Thus
they managed to return with the fullest possible information about
the enemy’s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the
Emperor, who in consequence of their report was able to inflict a
severe defeat on his adversary.” With the above classification it
is interesting to compare the remarks of Frederick the Great:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote186" id="FNanchor186">[186]</a>
<span lang="de">“Es giebt vielerley Sorten von Spions: 1. Geringe Leute, welche
sich von diesem Handwerk meliren. 2. Doppelte Spions. 3. Spions
von Consequenz, und endlich 4. Diejenigen, welche man zu diesem
unglücklichen Hankwerk zwinget.”</span> This of course is a bad
cross-division. The first class (<span lang="de">“Bürgersleute, Bauern, Priesters,</span>
etc.”) corresponds roughly to Sun Tzŭ’s “local spies,” and the
third to “inward spies.” Of <span lang="de">“Doppelte Spions”</span> it is broadly stated
that they are employed <span lang="de">“um dem Feinde falsche Nachrichten
aufzubinden.”</span> Thus they would include both converted and doomed
spies. Frederick’s last class of spies does not appear in Sun
Tzŭ’s list, perhaps because the risk in using them is too great.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">14. 故三軍之親莫親於間賞莫厚於間事莫密於間</p>
<p>Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate

<p class="annot">The original text and the <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> have <span lang="zh">事</span> in place of the first
<span lang="zh">親</span>. Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch‘ên point out that the spy is privileged to

<p class="pagenum" id="Page_169">{169}</p>

<p class="trans_noindent">In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: <span lang="zh">出口入耳也</span>, that is to say, all
communications with spies should be carried on “mouth-to-ear.”
Capt. Calthrop has: “All matters relating to spies are secret,”
which is distinctly feeble. An inferior reading for <span lang="zh">密</span> is <span lang="zh">審</span>. The
following remarks on spies may be quoted from Turenne, who made
perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander: “Spies
are attached to those who give them most, he who pays them ill is
never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor should
they know one another. When they propose anything very material,
secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives
and children as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate
anything to them but what it is absolutely necessary that they
should know.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote187" id="FNanchor187">[187]</a></p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">15. 非聖智不能用間</p>

these attributes to the spies themselves: <span lang="zh">先量間者之性誠實多智然後可用之</span>
“Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity

continues: <span lang="zh">厚貌深情險於山川非聖人莫能知</span> “A brazen face and a crafty
disposition are more dangerous than mountains or rivers; it takes

<p class="annot">The Chinese here is so concise and elliptical that some expansion
is necessary for the proper understanding of it. <span lang="zh">間事</span> denotes
important information about the enemy obtained from a surviving
spy. The subject of <span lang="zh">未發</span>, however, is not this information itself,
but the secret stratagem built up on the strength of it. <span lang="zh">聞者</span> means
“is heard”—by anybody else. Thus, word for word, we get: “If spy
matters are heard before [our plans] are carried out,” etc. Capt.
Calthrop, in translating <span lang="zh">間與所告者</span> “the spy who told the matter,
and the man who repeated the same,” may appeal to the authority of
the commentators; but he surely misses the main point of Sun Tzŭ’s
injunction. For, whereas you kill the spy himself <span lang="zh">惡其泄</span> “as a
punishment for letting out the secret,” the object of killing the
other man is only, as Ch‘ên Hao puts it, <span lang="zh">以滅口</span> “to stop his mouth”
and prevent the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">{171}</span> news leaking any further. If it had already been
repeated to others, this object would not be gained. Either way,
Sun Tzŭ lays himself open to the charge of inhumanity, though Tu
Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man deserves to be put
to death, for the spy would certainly not have told the secret
unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him. The
<cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> and <cite>Yü Lan</cite> have the reading ... <span lang="zh">先聞其間者與</span>, etc.,

<p class="trans_noindent">Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">22. 因是而知之故鄉間內間可得而使也</p>
<p>It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are
able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Yu expands <span lang="zh">因是而知之</span> into <span lang="zh">因反敵間而知敵情</span> “through conversion of
the enemy’s spies we learn the enemy’s condition.” And Chang Yü
says: <span lang="zh">因是反間知彼鄉人之貪利者官人之有𨻶者誘而使之</span> “We must tempt the
converted spy into our service, because it is he that knows which
of the local inhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the
officials are open to corruption.” In the <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite>, <span lang="zh">鄉</span> has been
altered to <span lang="zh">因</span>, doubtless for the sake of uniformity with § 9.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">23. 因是而知之故死間爲誑事可使告敵</p>
<p>It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed
spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.</p>
<p class="annot">“Because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best be
deceived” (Chang Yü). The <cite>T‘ung Tien</cite> text, followed by the <i>Yü
Lan</i>, has here the obviously interpolated sentence <span lang="zh">因是可得而攻也</span>.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">24. 因是而知之故生間有使如期</p>
<p>Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on
appointed occasions.</p>
<p class="annot">Capt. Calthrop omits this sentence.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_173">{173}</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">25. 五間之事主必知之知之必在於反間故反間不可不厚也</p>
<p>The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of
the enemy;</p>
<p class="annot">I have ventured to differ in this place from those commentators—Tu
Yu and Chang Yü—who understand <span lang="zh">主</span> as <span lang="zh">人主</span>, and make <span lang="zh">五間之事</span> the
antecedent of <span lang="zh">之</span> (the others ignoring the point altogether). It
is plausible enough that Sun Tzŭ should require the ruler to be
familiar with the methods of spying (though one would rather
expect <span lang="zh">將</span> “general” in place of <span lang="zh">主</span>) But this involves taking <span lang="zh">知之</span>
here in quite a different way from the <span lang="zh">知之</span> immediately following,
as also from those in the previous sentences. <span lang="zh">之</span> there refers
vaguely to the enemy or the enemy’s condition, and in order to
retain the same meaning here, I make <span lang="zh">主</span> a verb, governed by
<span lang="zh">五間之事</span>. Cf. XI. § 19, where <span lang="zh">主</span> is used in exactly the same
manner. The sole objection that I can see in the way of this
interpretation is the fact that the <span lang="zh">死間</span>, or fourth variety of spy,
does not add to our knowledge of the enemy, but only misinforms
the enemy about us. This would be, however, but a trivial
oversight on Sun Tzŭ’s part, inasmuch as the “doomed spy” is in
the strictest sense not to be reckoned as a spy at all. Capt.
Calthrop, it is hardly necessary to remark, slurs over the whole
difficulty.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from
the converted spy.</p>
<p class="annot">As explained in §§ 22–24. He not only brings information himself,
but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the
utmost liberality.</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">26. 昔殷之興也伊摯在夏周之興也呂牙在殷</p>
<p>Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty</p>
<p class="annot">Sun Tzŭ means the <span lang="zh">商</span> Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name
was changed to Yin by <span lang="zh">盤庚</span> P‘an Kêng in 1401.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">was due to I Chih</p>
<p class="annot">Better known as <span lang="zh">伊尹</span> I Yin, the famous general and statesman who
took part in Ch‘êng T‘ang’s campaign against <span lang="zh">桀癸</span> Chieh Kuei.</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_174">{174}</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty
was due to Lü Ya</p>
<p class="annot"><span lang="zh">呂尙</span> Lü Shang, whose “style” was <span lang="zh">子牙</span>, rose to high office
under the tyrant <span lang="zh">紂辛</span> Chou Hsin, whom he afterwards helped to
overthrow. Popularly known as <span lang="zh">太公</span>, a title bestowed on him by Wên
Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on war, erroneously
identified with the <span lang="zh">六韜</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">who had served under the Yin.</p>
<p class="annot">There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to
introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are
by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly
doubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lü Ya as illustrious
examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His
suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the
intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcomings which these
former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch‘ên
appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: “I Yin
and Lü Ya,” he says, “were not rebels against the Government
(<span lang="zh">非叛於國也</span>). Hsia could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him.
Yin could not employ the latter, hence Chou employed him. Their great
achievements were all for the good of the people.” Ho Shih is also
indignant: <span lang="zh">伊呂聖人之耦豈爲人間哉今孫子引之者言五間之用須上智之人如伊呂之才智者可以用間葢重之之辭耳</span>
“How should two divinely inspired men such as I and
Lü have acted as common spies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means
that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which
requires men of the highest mental calibre like I and Lü, whose
wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task. The above words only
emphasise this point.” Ho Shih believes then that the two heroes are
mentioned on account of their supposed skill in the use of spies. But
this is very weak, as it leaves totally unexplained the significant
words <span lang="zh">在夏</span> and <span lang="zh">在殷</span>. Capt. Calthrop speaks, rather strangely, of “the
province of Yin ... the country of Hsia ... the State of Chu ... the
people of Shang.”</p>
<p class="ctext" lang="zh">27. 故惟明君賢將能以上智爲間者必成大功此兵之要三軍之所恃而動也</p>
<p>Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will
use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying,</p>
<p class="pagenum" id="Page_175">{175}</p>
<p class="annot">Ch‘ên Hao compares § 15: <span lang="zh">非聖智不能用間</span>. He points out that <span lang="zh">湯武之聖伊呂宜用</span>
“the god-like wisdom of Ch‘êng T‘ang and Wu Wang led them
to employ I Yin and Lü Shang.” The <cite>T‘u Shu</cite> omits <span lang="zh">惟</span>.</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">and thereby they achieve great results.</p>
<p class="annot">Tu Mu closes with a note of warning:
<span lang="zh">夫水所以能濟舟亦有因水而覆沒者間所以能成功亦有憑間而傾敗者</span>
“Just as water, which carries a boat from
bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so reliance on
spies, while productive of great results, is oft-times the cause
of utter destruction.”</p>
<p class="trans_noindent">Spies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an
army’s ability to move.</p>
<p class="annot">The antecedent to <span lang="zh">此</span> must be either <span lang="zh">間者</span> or <span lang="zh">用間者</span> understood from
the whole sentence. Chia Lin says that an army without spies is
like a man without ears or eyes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
