i laying plans


 sun tz said the art of war is of vital importance to the state




 it is a matter of life and death a road either to safety or to ruin hence

it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected




 the art of war then is governed by five constant factors to be taken into

account in ones deliberations when seeking to determine the conditions

obtaining in the field




 these are  the moral law  heaven  earth  the commander 

method and discipline




  the moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with

their ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives undismayed

by any danger




 heaven signifies night and day cold and heat times and seasons




 earth comprises distances great and small danger and security open ground

and narrow passes the chances of life and death




 the commander stands for the virtues of wisdom sincerity benevolence

courage and strictness




 by method and discipline are to be understood the marshalling of the

army in its proper subdivisions the gradations of rank among the officers the

maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army and the control of

military expenditure




 these five heads should be familiar to every general he who knows them

will be victorious he who knows them not will fail




 therefore in your deliberations when seeking to determine the military

conditions let them be made the basis of a comparison in this wise




  which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law

 which of the two generals has most ability

 with whom lie the advantages derived from heaven and earth

 on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced

 which army is the stronger

 on which side are officers and men more highly trained

 in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment




 by means of these seven considerations i can forecast victory or defeat




 the general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it will conquer let

such a one be retained in command the general that hearkens not to my counsel

nor acts upon it will suffer defeatlet such a one be dismissed




 while heeding the profit of my counsel avail yourself also of any helpful

circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules




 according as circumstances are favourable one should modify ones

plans




 all warfare is based on deception




 hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we

must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far

away when far away we must make him believe we are near




 hold out baits to entice the enemy feign disorder and crush him




 if he is secure at all points be prepared for him if he is in superior

strength evade him




 if your opponent is of choleric temper seek to irritate him pretend to be

weak that he may grow arrogant




 if he is taking his ease give him no rest if his forces are united

separate them




 attack him where he is unprepared appear where you are not expected




 these military devices leading to victory must not be divulged

beforehand




 now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere

the battle is fought the general who loses a battle makes but few calculations

beforehand thus do many calculations lead to victory and few calculations to

defeat how much more no calculation at all it is by attention to this point

that i can foresee who is likely to win or lose




ii waging war


 sun tz said in the operations of war where there are in the field a

thousand swift chariots as many heavy chariots and a hundred thousand

mailclad soldiers with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li

the expenditure at home and at the front including entertainment of guests

small items such as glue and paint and sums spent on chariots and armour will

reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day such is the cost of

raising an army of  men




 when you engage in actual fighting if victory is long in coming the

mens weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped if you lay

siege to a town you will exhaust your strength




 again if the campaign is protracted the resources of the state will not be

equal to the strain




 now when your weapons are dulled your ardour damped your strength

exhausted and your treasure spent other chieftains will spring up to take

advantage of your extremity then no man however wise will be able to avert

the consequences that must ensue




 thus though we have heard of stupid haste in war cleverness has never been

seen associated with long delays




 there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare




 it is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can

thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on




 the skilful soldier does not raise a second levy neither are his

supplywaggons loaded more than twice




 bring war material with you from home but forage on the enemy thus the

army will have food enough for its needs




 poverty of the state exchequer causes an army to be maintained by

contributions from a distance contributing to maintain an army at a distance

causes the people to be impoverished




 on the other hand the proximity of an army causes prices to go up and

high prices cause the peoples substance to be drained away




 when their substance is drained away the peasantry will be afflicted by

heavy exactions




  with this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength the homes of

the people will be stripped bare and threetenths of their incomes will be

dissipated while government expenses for broken chariots wornout horses

breastplates and helmets bows and arrows spears and shields protective

mantlets draughtoxen and heavy waggons will amount to fourtenths of its

total revenue




 hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy one cartload

of the enemys provisions is equivalent to twenty of ones own and

likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to twenty from

ones own store




 now in order to kill the enemy our men must be roused to anger that there

may be advantage from defeating the enemy they must have their rewards




 therefore in chariot fighting when ten or more chariots have been taken

those should be rewarded who took the first our own flags should be

substituted for those of the enemy and the chariots mingled and used in

conjunction with ours the captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept




 this is called using the conquered foe to augment ones own

strength




 in war then let your great object be victory not lengthy campaigns




 thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the

peoples fate the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in

peace or in peril




iii attack by stratagem


 sun tz said in the practical art of war the best thing of all is to take

the enemys country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it is not so

good so too it is better to capture an army entire than to destroy it to

capture a regiment a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them




 hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence

supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without

fighting




 thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemys plans

the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemys forces the next

in order is to attack the enemys army in the field and the worst policy

of all is to besiege walled cities




 the rule is not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided the

preparation of mantlets movable shelters and various implements of war will

take up three whole months and the piling up of mounds over against the walls

will take three months more




 the general unable to control his irritation will launch his men to the

assault like swarming ants with the result that onethird of his men are

slain while the town still remains untaken such are the disastrous effects of

a siege




 therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemys troops without any

fighting he captures their cities without laying siege to them he overthrows

their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field




 with his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the empire and thus

without losing a man his triumph will be complete this is the method of

attacking by stratagem




 it is the rule in war if our forces are ten to the enemys one to

surround him if five to one to attack him if twice as numerous to divide

our army into two




 if equally matched we can offer battle if slightly inferior in numbers we

can avoid the enemy if quite unequal in every way we can flee from him




 hence though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force in the end

it must be captured by the larger force




 now the general is the bulwark of the state if the bulwark is complete at

all points the state will be strong if the bulwark is defective the state

will be weak




 there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his

army




  by commanding the army to advance or to retreat being ignorant of the

fact that it cannot obey this is called hobbling the army




  by attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a

kingdom being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army this causes

restlessness in the soldiers minds




  by employing the officers of his army without discrimination through

ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances this shakes

the confidence of the soldiers




 but when the army is restless and distrustful trouble is sure to come from

the other feudal princes this is simply bringing anarchy into the army and

flinging victory away




 thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory

 he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight

 he will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces

 he will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its

ranks

 he will win who prepared himself waits to take the enemy unprepared

 he will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the

sovereign

victory lies in the knowledge of these five points




 hence the saying if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not

fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not the enemy

for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat if you know neither the

enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle




iv tactical dispositions


 sun tz said the good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the

possibility of defeat and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the

enemy




 to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the

opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself




 thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat but cannot

make certain of defeating the enemy




 hence the saying one may know how to conquer without being able to

do it




 security against defeat implies defensive tactics ability to defeat the

enemy means taking the offensive




 standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength attacking a

superabundance of strength




 the general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret recesses of

the earth he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights

of heaven thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves on the

other a victory that is complete




 to see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the

acme of excellence




 neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole

empire says well done




 to lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength to see sun and moon is

no sign of sharp sight to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear




 what the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins but

excels in winning with ease




 hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for

courage




 he wins his battles by making no mistakes making no mistakes is what

establishes the certainty of victory for it means conquering an enemy that is

already defeated




 hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat

impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy




 thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after

the victory has been won whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and

afterwards looks for victory




 the consummate leader cultivates the moral law and strictly adheres to

method and discipline thus it is in his power to control success




 in respect of military method we have firstly measurement secondly

estimation of quantity thirdly calculation fourthly balancing of chances

fifthly victory




 measurement owes its existence to earth estimation of quantity to

measurement calculation to estimation of quantity balancing of chances to

calculation and victory to balancing of chances




 a victorious army opposed to a routed one is as a pounds weight

placed in the scale against a single grain




 the onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pentup waters

into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep so much for tactical dispositions




v energy


 sun tz said the control of a large force is the same principle as the

control of a few men it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers




 fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from

fighting with a small one it is merely a question of instituting signs and

signals




 to ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemys

attack and remain unshakenthis is effected by manuvers direct and

indirect




 that the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an

eggthis is effected by the science of weak points and strong




 in all fighting the direct method may be used for joining battle but

indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory




 indirect tactics efficiently applied are inexhaustible as heaven and

earth unending as the flow of rivers and streams like the sun and moon they

end but to begin anew like the four seasons they pass away but to return once

more




 there are not more than five musical notes yet the combinations of these

five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard




 there are not more than five primary colours blue yellow red white and

black yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever be seen




 there are not more than five cardinal tastes sour acrid salt sweet

bitter yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted




 in battle there are not more than two methods of attackthe direct

and the indirect yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series

of manuvers




 the direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn it is like

moving in a circleyou never come to an end who can exhaust the

possibilities of their combination




 the onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll

stones along in its course




 the quality of decision is like the welltimed swoop of a falcon which

enables it to strike and destroy its victim




 therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset and prompt in his

decision




 energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow decision to the

releasing of the trigger




 amid the turmoil and tumult of battle there may be seeming disorder and

yet no real disorder at all amid confusion and chaos your array may be

without head or tail yet it will be proof against defeat




 simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline simulated fear postulates

courage simulated weakness postulates strength




 hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of

subdivision concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of

latent energy masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical

dispositions




 thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains

deceitful appearances according to which the enemy will act he sacrifices

something that the enemy may snatch at it




 by holding out baits he keeps him on the march then with a body of picked

men he lies in wait for him




 the clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy and does not

require too much from individuals hence his ability to pick out the right men

and utilise combined energy




 when he utilises combined energy his fighting men become as it were like

unto rolling logs or stones for it is the nature of a log or stone to remain

motionless on level ground and to move when on a slope if fourcornered to

come to a standstill but if roundshaped to go rolling down




 thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a

round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height so much on the

subject of energy




vi weak points and strong


 sun tz said whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the

enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to

hasten to battle will arrive exhausted




 therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy but does not

allow the enemys will to be imposed on him




 by holding out advantages to him he can cause the enemy to approach of his

own accord or by inflicting damage he can make it impossible for the enemy

to draw near




 if the enemy is taking his ease he can harass him if well supplied with

food he can starve him out if quietly encamped he can force him to move




 appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly to

places where you are not expected




 an army may march great distances without distress if it marches through

country where the enemy is not




 you can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places

which are undefendedyou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold

positions that cannot be attacked




 hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to

defend and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not know what to

attack




 o divine art of subtlety and secrecy through you we learn to be invisible

through you inaudible and hence we can hold the enemys fate in our

hands




 you may advance and be absolutely irresistible if you make for the

enemys weak points you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your

movements are more rapid than those of the enemy




 if we wish to fight the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though

he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch all we need do is

attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve




 if we do not wish to fight we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even

though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground all we

need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way




 by discovering the enemys dispositions and remaining invisible

ourselves we can keep our forces concentrated while the enemys must be

divided




 we can form a single united body while the enemy must split up into

fractions hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a

whole which means that we shall be many to the enemys few




 and if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one

our opponents will be in dire straits




 the spot where we intend to fight must not be made known for then the

enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different

points and his forces being thus distributed in many directions the numbers

we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few




 for should the enemy strengthen his van he will weaken his rear should he

strengthen his rear he will weaken his van should he strengthen his left he

will weaken his right should he strengthen his right he will weaken his left

if he sends reinforcements everywhere he will everywhere be weak




 numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks

numerical strength from compelling our adversary to make these preparations

against us




 knowing the place and the time of the coming battle we may concentrate

from the greatest distances in order to fight




 but if neither time nor place be known then the left wing will be impotent

to succour the right the right equally impotent to succour the left the van

unable to relieve the rear or the rear to support the van how much more so if

the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart

and even the nearest are separated by several li



 though according to my estimate the soldiers of yeh exceed our own in

number that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory i say then

that victory can be achieved




 though the enemy be stronger in numbers we may prevent him from fighting

scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success




 rouse him and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity force him

to reveal himself so as to find out his vulnerable spots




 carefully compare the opposing army with your own so that you may know

where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient




 in making tactical dispositions the highest pitch you can attain is to

conceal them conceal your dispositions and you will be safe from the prying

of the subtlest spies from the machinations of the wisest brains




 how victory may be produced for them out of the enemys own

tacticsthat is what the multitude cannot comprehend




 all men can see the tactics whereby i conquer but what none can see is the

strategy out of which victory is evolved




 do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory but let your

methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances




 military tactics are like unto water for water in its natural course runs

away from high places and hastens downwards




 so in war the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is

weak




 water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it

flows the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is

facing




 therefore just as water retains no constant shape so in warfare there are

no constant conditions




 he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby

succeed in winning may be called a heavenborn captain




 the five elements water fire wood metal earth are not always equally

predominant the four seasons make way for each other in turn there are short

days and long the moon has its periods of waning and waxing




vii manuvering


 sun tz said in war the general receives his commands from the sovereign




 having collected an army and concentrated his forces he must blend and

harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp




 after that comes tactical manuvering than which there is nothing more

difficult the difficulty of tactical manuvering consists in turning the

devious into the direct and misfortune into gain




 thus to take a long and circuitous route after enticing the enemy out of

the way and though starting after him to contrive to reach the goal before

him shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation




 manuvering with an army is advantageous with an undisciplined multitude

most dangerous




 if you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage

the chances are that you will be too late on the other hand to detach a

flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores




 thus if you order your men to roll up their buffcoats and make forced

marches without halting day or night covering double the usual distance at a

stretch doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage the leaders

of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy




 the stronger men will be in front the jaded ones will fall behind and on

this plan only onetenth of your army will reach its destination




 if you march fifty li in order to outmanuver the enemy you will

lose the leader of your first division and only half your force will reach the

goal




 if you march thirty li with the same object twothirds of your army

will arrive




 we may take it then that an army without its baggagetrain is lost without

provisions it is lost without bases of supply it is lost




 we cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of

our neighbours




 we are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the

face of the countryits mountains and forests its pitfalls and

precipices its marshes and swamps




 we shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use

of local guides




 in war practise dissimulation and you will succeed move only if there is

a real advantage to be gained




 whether to concentrate or to divide your troops must be decided by

circumstances




 let your rapidity be that of the wind your compactness that of the forest




 in raiding and plundering be like fire in immovability like a mountain




 let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move fall

like a thunderbolt




 when you plunder a countryside let the spoil be divided amongst your men

when you capture new territory cut it up into allotments for the benefit of

the soldiery




 ponder and deliberate before you make a move




 he will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation such is the art

of manuvering




 the book of army management says on the field of battle the spoken word

does not carry far enough hence the institution of gongs and drums nor can

ordinary objects be seen clearly enough hence the institution of banners and

flags




 gongs and drums banners and flags are means whereby the ears and eyes of

the host may be focussed on one particular point




 the host thus forming a single united body is it impossible either for the

brave to advance alone or for the cowardly to retreat alone this is the art

of handling large masses of men




 in nightfighting then make much use of signalfires and drums and in

fighting by day of flags and banners as a means of influencing the ears and

eyes of your army




 a whole army may be robbed of its spirit a commanderinchief may be

robbed of his presence of mind




 now a soldiers spirit is keenest in the morning by noonday it has

begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent only on returning to camp




 a clever general therefore avoids an army when its spirit is keen but

attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return this is the art of

studying moods




 disciplined and calm to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub

amongst the enemythis is the art of retaining selfpossession




 to be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it to wait at ease

while the enemy is toiling and struggling to be wellfed while the enemy is

famishedthis is the art of husbanding ones strength




 to refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order

to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident

arraythis is the art of studying circumstances




 it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to

oppose him when he comes downhill




 do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight do not attack soldiers whose

temper is keen




 do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy do not interfere with an army

that is returning home




 when you surround an army leave an outlet free do not press a desperate

foe too hard




 such is the art of warfare




viii variation of tactics


 sun tz said in war the general receives his commands from the sovereign

collects his army and concentrates his forces




 when in difficult country do not encamp in country where high roads

intersect join hands with your allies do not linger in dangerously isolated

positions in hemmedin situations you must resort to stratagem in a

desperate position you must fight




 there are roads which must not be followed armies which must be not

attacked towns which must not be besieged positions which must not be

contested commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed




 the general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany

variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops




 the general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with the

configuration of the country yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to

practical account




 so the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his

plans even though he be acquainted with the five advantages will fail to make

the best use of his men




 hence in the wise leaders plans considerations of advantage and of

disadvantage will be blended together




 if our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way we may succeed in

accomplishing the essential part of our schemes




 if on the other hand in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to

seize an advantage we may extricate ourselves from misfortune




 reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them and make trouble

for them and keep them constantly engaged hold out specious allurements and

make them rush to any given point




 the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the

enemys not coming but on our own readiness to receive him not on the

chance of his not attacking but rather on the fact that we have made our

position unassailable




 there are five dangerous faults which may affect a general

 recklessness which leads to destruction

 cowardice which leads to capture

 a hasty temper which can be provoked by insults

 a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame

 oversolicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble




 these are the five besetting sins of a general ruinous to the conduct of

war




 when an army is overthrown and its leader slain the cause will surely be

found among these five dangerous faults let them be a subject of meditation




ix the army on the march


 sun tz said we come now to the question of encamping the army and

observing signs of the enemy pass quickly over mountains and keep in the

neighbourhood of valleys




 camp in high places facing the sun do not climb heights in order to fight

so much for mountain warfare




 after crossing a river you should get far away from it




 when an invading force crosses a river in its onward march do not advance

to meet it in midstream it will be best to let half the army get across and

then deliver your attack




 if you are anxious to fight you should not go to meet the invader near a

river which he has to cross




 moor your craft higher up than the enemy and facing the sun do not move

upstream to meet the enemy so much for river warfare




 in crossing saltmarshes your sole concern should be to get over them

quickly without any delay




 if forced to fight in a saltmarsh you should have water and grass near

you and get your back to a clump of trees so much for operations in

saltmarshes




 in dry level country take up an easily accessible position with rising

ground to your right and on your rear so that the danger may be in front and

safety lie behind so much for campaigning in flat country




 these are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the

yellow emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns




 all armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark




 if you are careful of your men and camp on hard ground the army will be

free from disease of every kind and this will spell victory




 when you come to a hill or a bank occupy the sunny side with the slope on

your right rear thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and

utilise the natural advantages of the ground




 when in consequence of heavy rains upcountry a river which you wish to

ford is swollen and flecked with foam you must wait until it subsides




 country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running

between deep natural hollows confined places tangled thickets quagmires and

crevasses should be left with all possible speed and not approached




 while we keep away from such places we should get the enemy to approach

them while we face them we should let the enemy have them on his rear




 if in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly country

ponds surrounded by aquatic grass hollow basins filled with reeds or woods

with thick undergrowth they must be carefully routed out and searched for

these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be

lurking




 when the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet he is relying on the

natural strength of his position




 when he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle he is anxious for the

other side to advance




 if his place of encampment is easy of access he is tendering a bait




 movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing

the appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that

the enemy wants to make us suspicious




 the rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade startled

beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming




 when there is dust rising in a high column it is the sign of chariots

advancing when the dust is low but spread over a wide area it betokens the

approach of infantry when it branches out in different directions it shows

that parties have been sent to collect firewood a few clouds of dust moving to

and fro signify that the army is encamping




 humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about

to advance violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs

that he will retreat




 when the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings

it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle




 peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot




 when there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank it means

that the critical moment has come




 when some are seen advancing and some retreating it is a lure




 when the soldiers stand leaning on their spears they are faint from want

of food




 if those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves the army

is suffering from thirst




 if the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure

it the soldiers are exhausted




 if birds gather on any spot it is unoccupied clamour by night betokens

nervousness




 if there is disturbance in the camp the generals authority is weak

if the banners and flags are shifted about sedition is afoot if the officers

are angry it means that the men are weary




 when an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food and

when the men do not hang their cookingpots over the campfires showing that

they will not return to their tents you may know that they are determined to

fight to the death




 the sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued

tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file




 too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources

too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress




 to begin by bluster but afterwards to take fright at the enemys

numbers shows a supreme lack of intelligence




 when envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths it is a sign that

the enemy wishes for a truce




 if the enemys troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a

long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again the

situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection




 if our troops are no more in number than the enemy that is amply

sufficient it only means that no direct attack can be made what we can do is

simply to concentrate all our available strength keep a close watch on the

enemy and obtain reinforcements




 he who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to

be captured by them




 if soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you they will

not prove submissive and unless submissive then will be practically useless

if when the soldiers have become attached to you punishments are not

enforced they will still be useless




 therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity but

kept under control by means of iron discipline this is a certain road to

victory




 if in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced the army will be

welldisciplined if not its discipline will be bad




 if a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders

being obeyed the gain will be mutual




x terrain


 sun tz said we may distinguish six kinds of terrain to wit 

accessible ground  entangling ground  temporising ground  narrow

passes  precipitous heights  positions at a great distance from the

enemy




 ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called

accessible




 with regard to ground of this nature be before the enemy in occupying the

raised and sunny spots and carefully guard your line of supplies then you

will be able to fight with advantage




 ground which can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called

entangling




 from a position of this sort if the enemy is unprepared you may sally

forth and defeat him but if the enemy is prepared for your coming and you

fail to defeat him then return being impossible disaster will ensue




 when the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first

move it is called temporising ground




 in a position of this sort even though the enemy should offer us an

attractive bait it will be advisable not to stir forth but rather to retreat

thus enticing the enemy in his turn then when part of his army has come out

we may deliver our attack with advantage




 with regard to narrow passes if you can occupy them first let them

be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy




 should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass do not go after him if

the pass is fully garrisoned but only if it is weakly garrisoned




 with regard to precipitous heights if you are beforehand with your

adversary you should occupy the raised and sunny spots and there wait for him

to come up




 if the enemy has occupied them before you do not follow him but retreat

and try to entice him away




 if you are situated at a great distance from the enemy and the strength of

the two armies is equal it is not easy to provoke a battle and fighting will

be to your disadvantage




 these six are the principles connected with earth the general who has

attained a responsible post must be careful to study them




 now an army is exposed to six several calamities not arising from natural

causes but from faults for which the general is responsible these are 

flight  insubordination  collapse  ruin  disorganisation 

rout




 other conditions being equal if one force is hurled against another ten

times its size the result will be the flight of the former




 when the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak the

result is insubordination when the officers are too strong and the

common soldiers too weak the result is collapse




 when the higher officers are angry and insubordinate and on meeting the

enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment before the

commanderinchief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight the

result is ruin




 when the general is weak and without authority when his orders are not

clear and distinct when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and

men and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner the result is

utter disorganisation




 when a general unable to estimate the enemys strength allows an

inferior force to engage a larger one or hurls a weak detachment against a

powerful one and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank the

result must be a rout




 these are six ways of courting defeat which must be carefully noted by the

general who has attained a responsible post




 the natural formation of the country is the soldiers best ally but

a power of estimating the adversary of controlling the forces of victory and

of shrewdly calculating difficulties dangers and distances constitutes the

test of a great general




 he who knows these things and in fighting puts his knowledge into

practice will win his battles he who knows them not nor practises them will

surely be defeated




 if fighting is sure to result in victory then you must fight even though

the ruler forbid it if fighting will not result in victory then you must not

fight even at the rulers bidding




 the general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing

disgrace whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for

his sovereign is the jewel of the kingdom




 regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into the

deepest valleys look on them as your own beloved sons and they will stand by

you even unto death




 if however you are indulgent but unable to make your authority felt

kindhearted but unable to enforce your commands and incapable moreover of

quelling disorder then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children they

are useless for any practical purpose




 if we know that our own men are in a condition to attack but are unaware

that the enemy is not open to attack we have gone only halfway towards

victory




 if we know that the enemy is open to attack but are unaware that our own

men are not in a condition to attack we have gone only halfway towards

victory




 if we know that the enemy is open to attack and also know that our men are

in a condition to attack but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes

fighting impracticable we have still gone only halfway towards victory




 hence the experienced soldier once in motion is never bewildered once he

has broken camp he is never at a loss




 hence the saying if you know the enemy and know yourself your victory

will not stand in doubt if you know heaven and know earth you may make your

victory complete




xi the nine situations


 sun tz said the art of war recognises nine varieties of ground 

dispersive ground  facile ground  contentious ground  open ground

 ground of intersecting highways  serious ground  difficult ground

 hemmedin ground  desperate ground




 when a chieftain is fighting in his own territory it is dispersive ground




 when he has penetrated into hostile territory but to no great distance it

is facile ground




 ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side is

contentious ground




 ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground




 ground which forms the key to three contiguous states so that he who

occupies it first has most of the empire at his command is ground of

intersecting highways




 when an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country leaving a

number of fortified cities in its rear it is serious ground




 mountain forests rugged steeps marshes and fensall country that is

hard to traverse this is difficult ground




 ground which is reached through narrow gorges and from which we can only

retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to

crush a large body of our men this is hemmed in ground




 ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without

delay is desperate ground




 on dispersive ground therefore fight not on facile ground halt not on

contentious ground attack not




 on open ground do not try to block the enemys way on ground of

intersecting highways join hands with your allies




 on serious ground gather in plunder in difficult ground keep steadily on

the march




 on hemmedin ground resort to stratagem on desperate ground fight




 those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge

between the enemys front and rear to prevent cooperation between his

large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad the

officers from rallying their men




 when the enemys men were scattered they prevented them from

concentrating even when their forces were united they managed to keep them in

disorder




 when it was to their advantage they made a forward move when otherwise

they stopped still




 if asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on

the point of marching to the attack i should say begin by seizing

something which your opponent holds dear then he will be amenable to your

will




 rapidity is the essence of war take advantage of the enemys

unreadiness make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots




 the following are the principles to be observed by an invading force the

further you penetrate into a country the greater will be the solidarity of

your troops and thus the defenders will not prevail against you




 make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food




 carefully study the wellbeing of your men and do not overtax them

concentrate your energy and hoard your strength keep your army continually on

the move and devise unfathomable plans




 throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape and they will

prefer death to flight if they will face death there is nothing they may not

achieve officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength




 soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear if there is no

place of refuge they will stand firm if they are in the heart of a hostile

country they will show a stubborn front if there is no help for it they will

fight hard




 thus without waiting to be marshalled the soldiers will be constantly on

the qui vive without waiting to be asked they will do your will

without restrictions they will be faithful without giving orders they can be

trusted




 prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts then

until death itself comes no calamity need be feared




 if our soldiers are not overburdened with money it is not because they

have a distaste for riches if their lives are not unduly long it is not

because they are disinclined to longevity




 on the day they are ordered out to battle your soldiers may weep those

sitting up bedewing their garments and those lying down letting the tears run

down their cheeks but let them once be brought to bay and they will display

the courage of a chu or a kuei




 the skilful tactician may be likened to the shuaijan now the

shuaijan is a snake that is found in the chang mountains strike

at its head and you will be attacked by its tail strike at its tail and you

will be attacked by its head strike at its middle and you will be attacked by

head and tail both




 asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuaijan i should

answer yes for the men of wu and the men of yeh are enemies yet if they are

crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm they will come to

each others assistance just as the left hand helps the right




 hence it is not enough to put ones trust in the tethering of horses

and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground




 the principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of

courage which all must reach




 how to make the best of both strong and weakthat is a question

involving the proper use of ground




 thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a

single man willynilly by the hand




 it is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy

upright and just and thus maintain order




 he must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and

appearances and thus keep them in total ignorance




 by altering his arrangements and changing his plans he keeps the enemy

without definite knowledge by shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes

he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose




 at the critical moment the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed

up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him he carries his men deep

into hostile territory before he shows his hand




 he burns his boats and breaks his cookingpots like a shepherd driving a

flock of sheep he drives his men this way and that and none knows whither he

is going




 to muster his host and bring it into dangerthis may be termed the

business of the general




 the different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground the

expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics and the fundamental laws of

human nature these are things that must most certainly be studied




 when invading hostile territory the general principle is that penetrating

deeply brings cohesion penetrating but a short way means dispersion




 when you leave your own country behind and take your army across

neighbourhood territory you find yourself on critical ground when there are

means of communication on all four sides the ground is one of intersecting

highways




 when you penetrate deeply into a country it is serious ground when you

penetrate but a little way it is facile ground




 when you have the enemys strongholds on your rear and narrow passes

in front it is hemmedin ground when there is no place of refuge at all it

is desperate ground




 therefore on dispersive ground i would inspire my men with unity of

purpose on facile ground i would see that there is close connection between

all parts of my army




 on contentious ground i would hurry up my rear




 on open ground i would keep a vigilant eye on my defences on ground of

intersecting highways i would consolidate my alliances




 on serious ground i would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies

on difficult ground i would keep pushing on along the road




 on hemmedin ground i would block any way of retreat on desperate ground

i would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives




 for it is the soldiers disposition to offer an obstinate resistance

when surrounded to fight hard when he cannot help himself and to obey

promptly when he has fallen into danger




 we cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are

acquainted with their designs we are not fit to lead an army on the march

unless we are familiar with the face of the countryits mountains and

forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and swamps we shall be

unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local

guides




 to be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles does not

befit a warlike prince




 when a warlike prince attacks a powerful state his generalship shows

itself in preventing the concentration of the enemys forces he overawes

his opponents and their allies are prevented from joining against him




 hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry nor does he

foster the power of other states he carries out his own secret designs

keeping his antagonists in awe thus he is able to capture their cities and

overthrow their kingdoms




 bestow rewards without regard to rule issue orders without regard to

previous arrangements and you will be able to handle a whole army as though

you had to do with but a single man




 confront your soldiers with the deed itself never let them know your

design when the outlook is bright bring it before their eyes but tell them

nothing when the situation is gloomy




 place your army in deadly peril and it will survive plunge it into

desperate straits and it will come off in safety




 for it is precisely when a force has fallen into harms way that is

capable of striking a blow for victory




 success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the

enemys purpose




 by persistently hanging on the enemys flank we shall succeed in the

long run in killing the commanderinchief




 this is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning




 on the day that you take up your command block the frontier passes

destroy the official tallies and stop the passage of all emissaries




 be stern in the councilchamber so that you may control the situation




 if the enemy leaves a door open you must rush in




 forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear and subtly contrive

to time his arrival on the ground




 walk in the path defined by rule and accommodate yourself to the enemy

until you can fight a decisive battle




 at first then exhibit the coyness of a maiden until the enemy gives you

an opening afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare and it will be

too late for the enemy to oppose you




xii the attack by fire


 sun tz said there are five ways of attacking with fire the first is to

burn soldiers in their camp the second is to burn stores the third is to burn

baggagetrains the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines the fifth is to

hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy




 in order to carry out an attack we must have means available the material

for raising fire should always be kept in readiness




 there is a proper season for making attacks with fire and special days for

starting a conflagration




 the proper season is when the weather is very dry the special days are

those when the moon is in the constellations of the sieve the wall the wing

or the crossbar for these four are all days of rising wind




 in attacking with fire one should be prepared to meet five possible

developments




  when fire breaks out inside the enemys camp respond at once with

an attack from without




  if there is an outbreak of fire but the enemys soldiers remain

quiet bide your time and do not attack




  when the force of the flames has reached its height follow it up with

an attack if that is practicable if not stay where you are




  if it is possible to make an assault with fire from without do not wait

for it to break out within but deliver your attack at a favourable moment




  when you start a fire be to windward of it do not attack from the

leeward




 a wind that rises in the daytime lasts long but a night breeze soon falls




 in every army the five developments connected with fire must be known the

movements of the stars calculated and a watch kept for the proper days




 hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence those

who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength




 by means of water an enemy may be intercepted but not robbed of all his

belongings




 unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his

attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise for the result is waste

of time and general stagnation




 hence the saying the enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead the good

general cultivates his resources




 move not unless you see an advantage use not your troops unless there is

something to be gained fight not unless the position is critical




 no ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen

no general should fight a battle simply out of pique




 if it is to your advantage make a forward move if not stay where you

are




 anger may in time change to gladness vexation may be succeeded by content




 but a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being

nor can the dead ever be brought back to life




 hence the enlightened ruler is heedful and the good general full of

caution this is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact




xiii the use of spies


 sun tz said raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them

great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources

of the state the daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver

there will be commotion at home and abroad and men will drop down exhausted on

the highways as many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in

their labor




 hostile armies may face each other for years striving for the victory which

is decided in a single day this being so to remain in ignorance of the

enemys condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred

ounces of silver in honours and emoluments is the height of inhumanity




 one who acts thus is no leader of men no present help to his sovereign no

master of victory




 thus what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and

conquer and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men is

foreknowledge




 now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits it cannot be

obtained inductively from experience nor by any deductive calculation




 knowledge of the enemys dispositions can only be obtained from other

men




 hence the use of spies of whom there are five classes  local spies 

inward spies  converted spies  doomed spies  surviving spies




 when these five kinds of spy are all at work none can discover the secret

system this is called divine manipulation of the threads it is

the sovereigns most precious faculty




 having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of

a district




 having inward spies making use of officials of the enemy




 having converted spies getting hold of the enemys spies and

using them for our own purposes




 having doomed spies doing certain things openly for purposes of

deception and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them to the

enemy




 surviving spies finally are those who bring back news from the

enemys camp




 hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to

be maintained than with spies none should be more liberally rewarded in no

other business should greater secrecy be preserved




 spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity




 they cannot be properly managed without benevolence and

straightforwardness




 without subtle ingenuity of mind one cannot make certain of the truth of

their reports




 be subtle be subtle and use your spies for every kind of business




 if a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe he

must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told




 whether the object be to crush an army to storm a city or to assassinate

an individual it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the

attendants the aidesdecamp the doorkeepers and sentries of the general in

command our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these




 the enemys spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out

tempted with bribes led away and comfortably housed thus they will become

converted spies and available for our service




 it is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able

to acquire and employ local and inward spies




 it is owing to his information again that we can cause the doomed spy to

carry false tidings to the enemy




 lastly it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on

appointed occasions




 the end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the

enemy and this knowledge can only be derived in the first instance from the

converted spy hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the

utmost liberality




 of old the rise of the yin dynasty was due to i chih who had served under

the hsia likewise the rise of the chou dynasty was due to l ya who had

served under the yin




 hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use

the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they

achieve great results spies are a most important element in war because on

them depends an armys ability to move

preface


the seventh volume of mmoires concernant lhistoire les sciences

les arts les murs les usages c des chinois is devoted to the

art of war and contains amongst other treatises les treize articles

de suntse translated from the chinese by a jesuit father joseph

amiot pre amiot appears to have enjoyed no small reputation as a

sinologue in his day and the field of his labours was certainly

extensive but his socalled translation of sun tz if placed side

by side with the original is seen at once to be little better than an

imposture it contains a great deal that sun tz did not write and

very little indeed of what he did here is a fair specimen taken from

the opening sentences of chapter 
de lhabilet dans le gouvernement des troupes suntse dit

ayez les noms de tous les officiers tant gnraux que subalternes

inscrivezles dans un catalogue  part avec la note des talents 

de la capacit de chacun deux afin de pouvoir les employer avec

avantage lorsque loccasion en sera venue faites en sorte que

tous ceux que vous devez commander soient persuads que votre

principale attention est de les prserver de tout dommage les

troupes que vous ferez avancer contre lennemi doivent tre comme

des pierres que vous lanceriez contre des ufs de vous  lennemi

il ne doit y avoir dautre diffrence que celle du fort au foible

du vuide au plein attaquez  dcouvert mais soyez vainqueur en

secret voil en peu de mots en quoi consiste lhabilet  toute

la perfection mme du gouvernement des troupes
throughout the nineteenth century which saw a wonderful development

in the study of chinese literature no translator ventured to tackle

sun tz although his work was known to be highly valued in china as

by far theviii oldest and best compendium of military science it

was not until the year  that the first english translation by

capt e f calthrop rfa appeared at tokyo under the title

sonshi the japanese form of sun tz unfortunately it was evident

that the translators knowledge of chinese was far too scanty to fit

him to grapple with the manifold difficulties of sun tz he himself

plainly acknowledges that without the aid of two japanese gentlemen

the accompanying translation would have been impossible we can only

wonder then that with their help it should have been so excessively

bad it is not merely a question of downright blunders from which

none can hope to be wholly exempt omissions were frequent hard

passages were wilfully distorted or slurred over such offences are

less pardonable they would not be tolerated in any edition of a greek

or latin classic and a similar standard of honesty ought to be

insisted upon in translations from chinese
from blemishes of this nature at least i believe that the present

translation is free it was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate

of my own powers but i could not help feeling that sun tz deserved a

better fate than had befallen him and i knew that at any rate i

could hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors towards

the end of  a new and revised edition of capt calthrops

translation was published in london this time however without any

allusion to his japanese collaborators my first three chapters were

then already in the printers hands so that the criticisms of capt

calthrop therein contained must be understood as referring to

his earlier edition in the subsequent chapters i have of course

transferred my attention to the second edition this is on the whole an

improvement on the other though there still remains much that cannot

passix muster some of the grosser blunders have been rectified and

lacunae filled up but on the other hand a certain number of new

mistakes appear the very first sentence of the introduction is

startlingly inaccurate and later on while mention is made of an army

of japanese commentators on sun tz who are these by the way not

a word is vouchsafed about the chinese commentators who nevertheless

i venture to assert form a much more numerous and infinitely more

important army
a few special features of the present volume may now be noticed in

the first place the text has been cut up into numbered paragraphs

both in order to facilitate crossreference and for the convenience of

students generally the division follows broadly that of sun

hsingyens edition but i have sometimes found it desirable to join

two or more of his paragraphs into one in quoting from other works

chinese writers seldom give more than the bare title by way of

reference and the task of research is apt to be seriously hampered in

consequence with a view to obviating this difficulty so far as sun

tz is concerned i have also appended a complete concordance of

chinese characters following in this the admirable example of legge

though an alphabetical arrangement has been preferred to the

distribution under radicals which he adopted another feature borrowed

from the chinese classics is the printing of text translation and

notes on the same page the notes however are inserted according to

the chinese method immediately after the passages to which they

refer from the mass of native commentary my aim has been to extract

the cream only adding the chinese text here and there when it seemed

to present points of literary interest though constituting in itself

an important branch of chinese literature very little commentary of

this kind has hitherto been made directly accessible by translation
x
i may say in conclusion that owing to the printing off of my

sheets as they were completed the work has not had the benefit of a

final revision on a review of the whole without modifying the

substance of my criticisms i might have been inclined in a few

instances to temper their asperity having chosen to wield a bludgeon

however i shall not cry out if in return i am visited with more than

a rap over the knuckles indeed i have been at some pains to put a

sword into the hands of future opponents by scrupulously giving either

text or reference for every passage translated a scathing review

even from the pen of the shanghai critic who despises mere

translations would not i must confess be altogether unwelcome

for after all the worst fate i shall have to dread is that which

befell the ingenious paradoxes of george in the vicar of wakefield

introduction


sun wu and his book
ssma chien gives the following biography of sun tz

 sun tz wu was a native of the chi state his art of war

brought him to the notice of  ho lu king of  wu ho lu said

to him i have carefully perused your  chapters may i submit your

theory of managing soldiers to a slight test
sun tz replied you may
ho lu asked may the test be applied to women
the answer was again in the affirmative so arrangements were made

to bring  ladies out of the palace sun tz divided them into

two companies and placed one of the kings favourite concubines

at the head of each he then bade them all take spears in their

hands and addressed them thus i presume you know the difference

between front and back right hand and left hand
the girls replied yes
sun tz went on when i say eyes front you must look straight

ahead when i say left turn you must face towards your left

hand when i say right turn you must face towards your right

hand when i say about turn you must face right round towards

the back
again the girls assented the words of command having been thus

explained he set up the halberds and battleaxes in order to

begin the drill then to the sound of drums he gave the order

right turn but the girls only burst out laughing sun tz said

if words of command are not clear and distinct if orders are not

thoroughly understood then the general is to blame
so he started drilling them again and this time gave the order

left turn whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of

laughter sun tz said if words of command are not clear and

distinct if orders are not thoroughly understood the general is

to blame but if his orders are clear and the soldiers

nevertheless disobey then it is the fault of their officers
so saying he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be

beheaded now the king of wu was watching thexii scene from the top

of a raised pavilion and when he saw that his favourite

concubines were about to be executed he was greatly alarmed and

hurriedly sent down the following message we are now quite

satisfied as to our generals ability to handle troops if we are

bereft of these two concubines our meat and drink will lose their

savour it is our wish that they shall not be beheaded
sun tz replied having once received his majestys commission to

be general of his forces there are certain commands of his

majesty which acting in that capacity i am unable to accept
accordingly he had the two leaders beheaded and straightway

installed the pair next in order as leaders in their place when

this had been done the drum was sounded for the drill once more

and the girls went through all the evolutions turning to the

right or to the left marching ahead or wheeling back kneeling or

standing with perfect accuracy and precision not venturing to

utter a sound then sun tz sent a messenger to the king saying

your soldiers sire are now properly drilled and disciplined and

ready for your majestys inspection they can be put to any use

that their sovereign may desire bid them go through fire and

water and they will not disobey
but the king replied let our general cease drilling and return to

camp as for us we have no wish to come down and inspect the

troops
thereupon sun tz said the king is only fond of words and cannot

translate them into deeds
after that ho lu saw that sun tz was one who knew how to handle

an army and finally appointed him general in the west he

defeated the chu state and forced his way into ying the capital

to the north he put fear into the states of chi and chin and

spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes and sun tz

shared in the might of the king

about sun tz himself this is all that ssma chien has to tell us in

this chapter but he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant

 sun pin born about a hundred years after his famous ancestors

death and also the outstanding military genius of his time the

historian speaks of him too as sun tz and in his preface we read

 sun tz had his feet cut off and yet continued to

discuss the art of war it seems likely then that pin was a

nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation unless indeed the story

was invented in order to account for the name the crowning incident

of his career the crushing defeat of his treacherous rival pang

chan will be found briefly related on p 
xiii
to return to the elder sun tz he is mentioned in two other passages

of the shih chi
in the third year of his reign  bc ho lu king of wu took

the field with  tzhs ie  wu yan and  po pei

and attacked chu he captured the town of  shu and slew the two

princes sons who had formerly been generals of wu he was then

meditating a descent on  ying the capital but the general sun

wu said the army is exhausted it is not yet possible we

must wait after further successful fighting in the

ninth year  bc king ho lu of wu addressed wu tzhs and

sun wu saying formerly you declared that it was not yet

possible for us to enter ying is the time ripe now the two men

replied chus general  tzchang is grasping and

covetous and the princes of  tang and  tsai both have a

grudge against him if your majesty has resolved to make a grand

attack you must win over tang and tsai and then you may

succeed ho lu followed this advice beat chu in five pitched

battles and marched into ying
this is the latest date at which anything is recorded of sun wu he

does not appear to have survived his patron who died from the effects

of a wound in 
in the chapter entitled  the earlier portion of which m chavannes

believes to be a fragment of a treatise on military weapons there

occurs this passage
from this time onward a number of famous soldiers arose one after

the other  kaofan who was employed by the chin state

wangtz in the service of chi and sun wu in the service of

wu these men developed and threw light upon the principles of war


xiv
it is obvious that ssma chien at least had no doubt about the

reality of sun wu as an historical personage and with one exception

to be noticed presently he is by far the most important authority on

the period in question it will not be necessary therefore to say

much of such a work as the  wu yeh chun chiu which is

supposed to have been written by  chao yeh of the st century ad

the attribution is somewhat doubtful but even if it were otherwise

his account would be of little value based as it is on the shih chi

and expanded with romantic details the story of sun tz will be

found for what it is worth in chapter  the only new points in it

worth noting are  sun tz was first recommended to ho lu by wu

tzhs  he is called a native of wu  he had previously

lived a retired life and his contemporaries were unaware of his

ability
the following passage occurs in  huainan tz when sovereign and

ministers show perversity of mind it is impossible even for a sun tz

to encounter the foe assuming that this work is genuine and

hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it we have here the earliest

direct reference to sun tz for huainan tz died in  bc many

years before the shih chi was given to the world
 liu hsiang bc  in his  says the reason why sun wu at

the head of  men beatxv chu with  is that the latter were

undisciplined
 tng mingshih in his  completed in  informs us

that the surname  was bestowed on sun wus grandfather by  duke

ching of chi  bc sun wus father sun  ping rose to be

a minister of state in chi and sun wu himself whose style was 

changching fled to wu on account of the rebellion which was being

fomented by the kindred of  tien pao he had three sons of whom

the second named  ming was the father of sun pin according to this

account then pin was the grandson of wu which considering that

sun pins victory over  wei was gained in  bc may be dismissed

as chronologically impossible whence these data were obtained by tng

mingshih i do not know but of course no reliance whatever can be

placed in them
an interesting document which has survived from the close of the han

period is the short preface written by the great  tsao tsao or

 wei wu ti for his edition of sun tz i shall give it in full

i have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their

advantage the lun y says there must be a sufficiency of

military strength the shu ching mentions the army among

the eight objects of government the i ching says 

army indicates firmness and justice the experienced leader will

have good fortunexvi the shih ching says the king rose

majestic in his wrath and he marshalled his troops the

yellow emperor tang the completer and wu wang all used spears

and battleaxes in order to succour their generation the ssma

fa says if one man slay another of set purpose he himself may

rightfully be slain he who relies solely on warlike measures

shall be exterminated he who relies solely on peaceful measures

shall perish instances of this are fu chai on the one hand

and yen wang on the other in military matters the sages

rule is normally to keep the peace and to move his forces only

when occasion requires he will not use armed force unless driven

to it by necessity
many books have i read on the subject of war and fighting but the

work composed by sun wu is the profoundest of them all sun tz

was a native of the chi state his personal name was wu he wrote

the art of war in  chapters for ho l king of wu its

principles were tested on women and he was subsequently made a

general he led an army westwards crushed the chu state and

entered ying the capital in the north he kept chi and chin in

awe a hundred years and more after his time sun pin lived he

was a descendant of wu in his treatment of deliberation and

planning the importance of rapidity in taking the field

clearness of conception and depth of design sunxvii tz stands

beyond the reach of carping criticism my contemporaries however

have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions and

while putting into practice the smaller details in which his work

abounds they have overlooked its essential purport that is the

motive which has led me to outline a rough explanation of the

whole

one thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that

the  chapters were specially composed for king ho lu this is

supported by the internal evidence of i   in which it seems clear

that some ruler is addressed
in the bibliographical section of the han shu there is an

entry which has given rise to much discussion  the

works of sun tz of wu in  pien or chapters with diagrams in 

chan it is evident that this cannot be merely the  chapters

known to ssma chien or those we possess today chang shouchieh

in his  refers to an edition of sun tzs  of which the 

chapters formed the first chan adding that there were two other

chan besides this has brought forth a theory that the bulk

of these  chapters consisted of other writings of sun tzwe should

call them apocryphalsimilar to the  wn ta of which a specimen

dealing with the nine situations is preserved in the  tung

tien and another in ho shihs commentary it is suggestedxviii that

before his interview with ho lu sun tz had only written the 

chapters but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of

question and answer between himself and the king  pi ihsn

author of the  sun tz hs lu backs this up with a quotation

from the wu yeh chun chiu the king of wu summoned sun tz and

asked him questions about the art of war each time he set forth a

chapter of his work the king could not find words enough to praise

him as he points out if the whole work was expounded on the

same scale as in the abovementioned fragments the total number of

chapters could not fail to be considerable then the numerous

other treatises attributed to sun tz might also be included the

fact that the han chih mentions no work of sun tz except the 

pien whereas the sui and tang bibliographies give the titles of

others in addition to the  chapters is good proof pi ihsn

thinks that all of these were contained in the  pien without

pinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the wu yeh

chun chiu or admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises

cited by pi ihsn we may see in this theory a probable solution of

the mystery between ssma chien and pan ku there was plenty of time

for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the magic

name of sun tz and the  pien may very well represent a

collected edition of these lumped together with the original workxix it

is also possible though less likely that some of them existed in the

time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him
tu mu after tsao kung the most important commentator on sun tz

composed the preface to his edition about the middle of the ninth

century after a somewhat lengthy defence of the military art he

comes at last to sun tz himself and makes one or two very startling

assertionsthe writings of sun wu he says originally comprised

several hundred thousand words but tsao tsao the emperor wu wei

pruned away all redundancies and wrote out the essence of the whole

so as to form a single book in  chapters he goes on to remark

that tsao tsaos commentary on sun tz leaves a certain proportion

of difficulties unexplained this in tu mus opinion does not

necessarily imply that he was unable to furnish a complete

commentary according to the wei chih tsao himself wrote a

book on war in something over  words known as the  it

appears to have been of such exceptional merit that he suspects tsao

to have used for it the surplus material which he had found in sun

tz he concludes however by saying the hsin shu is now lost so

that the truth cannot be known for certain
tu mus conjecture seems to be based on a passagexx in the  wei

wu ti strung together sun wus art of war which in turn may have

resulted from a misunderstanding of the final words of tsao kungs

preface  this as sun hsingyen points out is only a

modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase or in

other words wrote a commentary on it on the whole the theory has

met with very little acceptance thus the  says the

mention of the  chapters in the shih chi shows that they were in

existence before the han chih and that later accretions are not to

be considered part of the original work tu mus assertion can

certainly not be taken as proof
there is every reason to suppose then that the  chapters existed

in the time of ssma chien practically as we have them now that the

work was then well known he tells us in so many words sun tzs 

chapters and wu chis art of war are the two books that people

commonly refer to on the subject of military matters both of then are

widely distributed so i will not discuss them here but as we go

further back serious difficulties begin to arise the salient fact

which has to be faced is that the tso chuan the great contemporary

record makes no mention whatever of sunxxi wu either as a general or as

a writer it is natural in view of this awkward circumstance that

many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of sun wu as

given in the shih chi but even show themselves frankly sceptical as

to the existence of the man at all the most powerful presentment of

this side of the case is to be found in the following disquisition by

 yeh shuihsin
it is stated in ssma chiens history that sun wu was a native

of the chi state and employed by wu and that in the reign of ho

l he crushed chu entered ying and was a great general but in

tsos commentary no sun wu appears at all it is true that tsos

commentary need not contain absolutely everything that other

histories contain but tso has not omitted to mention vulgar

plebeians and hireling ruffians such as ying kaoshu tsao

kuei chu chihwu and chuan shchu in the case of

sun wu whose fame and achievements were so brilliant the

omission is much more glaring again details are given in their

due order about his contemporaries wu yan and the minister

pei is it credible that sun wu alone should have been passed

over
in point of literary style sun tzs work belongs to the same

school as kuan tz the liu tao and the yeh y

and may havexxii been the production of some private scholar living

towards the end of the spring and autumn or the beginning of the

warring states period the story that his precepts were

actually applied by the wu state is merely the outcome of big

talk on the part of his followers
from the flourishing period of the chou dynasty down to the

time of the spring and autumn all military commanders were

statesmen as well and the class of professional generals for

conducting external campaigns did not then exist it was not

until the period of the six states that this custom changed

now although wu was an uncivilised state is it conceivable that

tso should have left unrecorded the fact that sun wu was a great

general and yet held no civil office what we are told therefore

about jangch and sun wu is not authentic matter but the

reckless fabrication of theorising pundits the story of ho ls

experiment on the women in particular is utterly preposterous

and incredible
yeh shuihsin represents ssma chien as having said that sun wu

crushed chu and entered ying this is not quite correct no doubt the

impression left on the readers mind is that he at least shared in

these exploits but the actual subject of the verbs    and 

is certainly  as is shown by the next words 

the fact may or may not be significant but it is nowhere explicitly

stated in the shih chi either that sun tz was general on the

occasion ofxxiii the taking of ying or that he even went there at all

moreover as we know that wu yan and po pei both took part in the

expedition and also that its success was largely due to the dash and

enterprise of  fu kai ho lus younger brother it is not easy to

see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part in

the same campaign
 chn chnsun of the sung dynasty has the note
military writers look upon sun wu as the father of their art but

the fact that he does not appear in the tso chuan although he

is said to have served under ho l king of wu makes it uncertain

what period he really belonged to
he also says
the works of sun wu and wu chi may be of genuine antiquity
it is noticeable that both yeh shuihsin and chn chnsun while

rejecting the personality of sun wu as he figures in ssma chiens

history are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to

the work which passes under his name the author of the hs lu fails

to appreciate this distinction and consequently his bitter attack

on chn chnsun really misses its mark he makes one or two points

however which certainly tell in favour of the high antiquity of

our  chapters sun tz he says must have lived in the age

of ching wang  because he is frequently plagiarised in

subsequent works of the chou chin and han dynastiesxxiv the two

most shameless offenders in this respect are wu chi and huainan tz

both of them important historical personages in their day the former

lived only a century after the alleged date of sun tz and his death

is known to have taken place in  bc it was to him according to

liu hsiang that  tsng shn delivered the tso chuan which had

been entrusted to him by its author now the fact that quotations

from the art of war acknowledged or otherwise are to be found

in so many authors of different epochs establishes a very strong

probability that there was some common source anterior to them allin

other words that sun tzs treatise was already in existence towards

the end of the th century bc further proof of sun tzs antiquity

is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to

a number of the words he uses a list of these which might perhaps

be extended is given in the hs lu and though some of the

interpretations are doubtful the main argument is hardly affected

thereby again it must not be forgotten that yeh shuihsin a

scholar and critic of the first rank deliberately pronounces the

style of the  chapters toxxv belong to the early part of the fifth

century seeing that he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove

the existence of sun wu himself we may be sure that he would not

have hesitated to assign the work to a later date had he not honestly

believed the contrary and it is precisely on such a point that

the judgment of an educated chinaman will carry most weight other

internal evidence is not far to seek thus in xiii   there is an

unmistakable allusion to the ancient system of landtenure which had

already passed away by the time of mencius who was anxious to see it

revived in a modified form the only warfare sun tz knows is that

carried on between the various feudal princes  in which armoured

chariots play a large part their use seems to have entirely died out

before the end of the chou dynasty he speaks as a man of wu a state

which ceased to exist as early as  bc on this i shall touch

presently
but once refer the work to the th century or earlier and the

chances of its being other than a bon fide production are sensibly

diminished the great age of forgeries did not come until long after

that it should have been forged in the period immediately following

 is particularly unlikely for no one as a rule hastens to

identify himself with a lost cause as for yeh shuihsins theory

that the author was a literary recluse that seems to me quite

untenable if one thing is more apparent than another after reading

the maxims of sun tz it is that their essence has been distilled

from a large store of personal observation and experience they

reflect the mind not only of a born strategist gifted with a rare

faculty of generalisation but also of a practical soldier closely

acquainted with the military conditions of his time to say nothingxxvi

of the fact that these sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all

the greatest captains of chinese history they offer a combination

of freshness and sincerity acuteness and common sense which quite

excludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in the study

if we admit then that the  chapters were the genuine production of

a military man living towards the end of the chun chiu period are

we not bound in spite of the silence of the tso chuan to accept

ssma chiens account in its entirety in view of his high repute as

a sober historian must we not hesitate to assume that the records he

drew upon for sun wus biography were false and untrustworthy the

answer i fear must be in the negative there is still one grave if

not fatal objection to the chronology involved in the story as told

in the shih chi which so far as i am aware nobody has yet

pointed out there are two passages in sun tz in which he alludes

to contemporary affairs the first is in vi  
though according to my estimate the soldiers of yeh exceed our

own in number that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of

victory i say then that victory can be achieved
the other is in xi  
asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuaijan i should

answer yes for the men of wu and the men of yeh are enemies

yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught

by a storm they will come to each others assistance just as the

left hand helps the right
these two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of

composition they assign the work to the period of the struggle

between wu and yeh so much has been observed by pi ihsn but what

has hitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the

credibility of ssma chiens narrative as we have seen above the

first positive date given in connection with sun wu is  bc he is

then spoken of as a general acting as confidential adviser to ho lu

so that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken

placexxvii and of course the  chapters must have been written earlier

still but at that time and for several years after down to the

capture of ying in   chu and not yeh was the great hereditary

enemy of wu the two states chu and wu had been constantly at war

for over half a century whereas the first war between wu and yeh

was waged only in  and even then was no more than a short

interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with chu

now chu is not mentioned in the  chapters at all the natural

inference is that they were written at a time when yeh had become the

prime antagonist of wu that is after chu had suffered the great

humiliation of  at this point a table of dates may be found useful

bc
accession of ho lu
ho lu attacks chu but is dissuaded from entering  ying the

    capital shih chi mentions sun wu as general
another attack on chu
wu makes a successful attack on yeh this is the first war

    between the two states
 or chu invades wu but is signally defeated at  ychang
ho lu attacks chu with the aid of tang and tsai decisive

    battle of  poch and capture of ying last mention

    of sun wu in shih chi
yeh makes a raid on wu in the absence of its army wu is

    beaten by chin and evacuates ying
ho lu sends  fu chai to attack chu
 kou chien becomes king of yeh
wu attacks yeh but is defeated by kou chien at  tsuili

    ho lu is killedxxviii
fu chai defeats kou chien in the great battle of  fuchiao

    and enters the capital of yeh
 or kou chien renders homage to wu death of wu tzhs
kou chien invades wu in the absence of fu chai
 to further attacks by yeh on wu
kou chien lays siege to the capital of wu
final defeat and extinction of wu

the sentence quoted above from vi   hardly strikes me as one that

could have been written in the full flush of victory it seems rather

to imply that for the moment at least the tide had turned against

wu and that she was getting the worst of the struggle hence we may

conclude that our treatise was not in existence in  before which

date yeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against

wu ho lu died in  so that if the book was written for him it

must have been during the period  when there was a lull in

the hostilities wu having presumably been exhausted by its supreme

effort against chu on the other hand if we choose to disregard the

tradition connecting sun wus name with ho lu it might equally well

have seen the light between  and  or possibly in the period

 when yeh was once again becoming a very serious menace

we may feel fairly certain that the author whoever he may have been

was not a man of any great eminence in his own day on this point

the negative testimony of the tso chuan far outweighs any shred of

authority still attaching to the shih chi if once its other facts

are discredited sun hsingyen however makes a feeble attempt to

explain the omission of his name fromxxix the great commentary it was wu

tzhs he says who got all the credit of sun wus exploits because

the latter being an alien was not rewarded with an office in the

state
how then did the sun tz legend originate it may be that the growing

celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown

to its author it was felt to be only right and proper that one so

well versed in the science of war should have solid achievements

to his credit as well now the capture of ying was undoubtedly the

greatest feat of arms in ho lus reign it made a deep and lasting

impression on all the surrounding states and raised wu to the

shortlived zenith of her power hence what more natural as time

went on than that the acknowledged master of strategy sun wu should

be popularly identified with that campaign at first perhaps only in

the sense that his brain conceived and planned it afterwards that it

was actually carried out by him in conjunction with wu yan po

pei and fu kai
it is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of sun

tzs life must be based almost wholly on conjecture with this

necessary proviso i should say that he probably entered the service

of wu about the time of ho lus accession and gathered experience

though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer during the

intense military activity which marked the first half of that princes

reign if he rose to be a general at all he certainly was never

on an equal footing with the threexxx above mentioned he was doubtless

present at the investment and occupation of ying and witnessed wus

sudden collapse in the following year yehs attack at this critical

juncture when her rival was embarrassed on every side seems to have

convinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against

whom every effort would henceforth have to be directed sun wu was

thus a wellseasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous

book which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the

end rather than the beginning of ho lus reign the story of the

women may possibly have grown out of some real incident occurring

about the same time as we hear no more of sun wu after this from any

source he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to have

taken part in the deathstruggle with yeh which began with the

disaster at tsuili
if these inferences are approximately correct there is a certain

irony in the fate which decreed that chinas most illustrious man

of peace should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war
the text of sun tz
i have found it difficult to glean much about the history of sun tzs

text the quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the

 chapters of which ssma chien speaks were essentially the same

as those now extant we have his word for it that they were widely

circulated in his day and can only regret that he refrained from

discussing them on that account sun hsingyen says in his preface
during the chin and han dynasties sun tzs art of war was in

general use amongst military commanders but they seem to have

treated it as a work of mysterious import and were unwilling to

expound it forxxxi the benefit of posterity thus it came about that

wei wu was the first to write a commentary on it
as we have already seen there is no reasonable ground to suppose that

tsao kung tampered with the text but the text itself is often so

obscure and the number of editions which appeared from that time

onward so great especially during the tang and sung dynasties that

it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to

creep in towards the middle of the sung period by which time all the

chief commentaries on sun tz were in existence a certain  chi

tienpao published a work in  chan entitled  sun tz

with the collected commentaries of ten writers there was another

text with variant readings put forward by chu fu of  tahsing

which also had supporters among the scholars of that period but in

the ming editions sun hsingyen tells us these readings were for

some reason or other no longer put into circulation thus until

the end of the th century the text in sole possession of the field

was one derived from chi tienpaos edition although no actual copy

of that important work was known to have survived that therefore

is the text of sun tz which appears in the war section of the great

imperial encyclopaedia printed in  the  ku chin tu

shu chi chng another copy at my disposal of what is practically

the same text with slight variations is that contained in the

 eleven philosophers of the chou and chin dynastiesxxxii

 and the chinese printed in capt calthrops first edition

is evidently a similar version which has filtered through japanese

channels so things remained until  sun hsingyen  a

distinguished antiquarian and classical scholar who claimed to be

an actual descendant of sun wu accidentally discovered a copy of

chi tienpaos longlost work when on a visit to the library of the

 huayin temple appended to it was the  i shuo of 

chng yuhsien mentioned in the tung chih and also believed to

have perished this is what sun hsingyen designates as the 

or  original edition or texta rather misleading name for it

cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of sun tz in

its pristine purity chi tienpao was a careless compiler and

appears to have been content to reproduce the somewhat debased version

current in his day without troubling to collate itxxxiii with the earliest

editions then available fortunately two versions of sun tz even

older than the newly discovered work were still extant one buried

in the tung tien tu yus great treatise on the constitution the

other similarly enshrined in the tai ping y lan encyclopaedia in

both the complete text is to be found though split up into fragments

intermixed with other matter and scattered piecemeal over a number of

different sections considering that the y lan takes us back to

the year  and the tung tien about  years further still to

the middle of the tang dynasty the value of these early transcripts

of sun tz can hardly be overestimated yet the idea of utilising them

does not seem to have occurred to anyone until sun hsingyen acting

under government instructions undertook a thorough recension of the

text this is his own account
because of the numerous mistakes in the text of sun tz which his

editors had handed down the government ordered that the ancient

edition of chi tienpao should be used and that the text

should be revised and corrected throughout it happened that wu

nienhu the governor pi kua and hsi a graduate of the second

degree had all devoted themselves to this study probably

surpassing me therein accordingly i have had the whole work cut

on blocks as a textbook for military men
the three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on

the text of sun tz prior to sun hsingyens commission but we are

left in doubt as to the work they really accomplished at any rate

the new edition when ultimately produced appeared in the names of

sun hsingyen and only one coeditor  wu jnchi they took the

original text as their basis and by careful comparison with the

older versions as well as the extant commentaries and other sources

of information such asxxxiv the i shuo succeeded in restoring a very

large number of doubtful passages and turned out on the whole what

must be accepted as the closest approximation we are ever likely to

get to sun tzs original work this is what will hereafter be

denominated the standard text
the copy which i have used belongs to a reissue dated  it is in

 pn forming part of a wellprinted set of  early philosophical

works in  pn it opens with a preface by sun hsingyen

largely quoted in this introduction vindicating the traditional

view of sun tzs life and performances and summing up in remarkably

concise fashion the evidence in its favour this is followed by tsao

kungs preface to his edition and the biography of sun tz from

the shih chi both translated above then come firstly chng

yuhsiens i shuo with authors preface and next a short

miscellany of historical and bibliographical information entitled

 sun tz hs lu compiled by  pi ihsn as regards the

body of the work each separate sentence is followed by a note on the

text if required and then by the various commentaries appertaining

to it arranged in chronological order these we shall now proceed to

discuss briefly one by one
the commentators
sun tz can boast an exceptionally long and distinguished roll of

commentators which would do honour to any classic  ouyang hsiu

remarks on this fact though he wrote before the tale was complete

and rather ingeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of

war beingxxxv inexhaustible must therefore be susceptible of treatment

in a great variety of ways
  tsao tsao or  tsao kung afterwards known as  wei

wu ti ad  there is hardly any room for doubt that the

earliest commentary on sun tz actually came from the pen of this

extraordinary man whose biography in the san kuo chih reads

like a romance one of the greatest military geniuses that the world

has seen and napoleonic in the scale of his operations he was

especially famed for the marvellous rapidity of his marches which has

found expression in the line  talk of tsao tsao and

tsao tsao will appear ouyang hsiu says of him that he was a great

captain who measured his strength against tung cho l pu and the two

yan father and son and vanquished them all whereupon he divided

the empire of han with wu and shu and made himself king it is

recorded that whenever a council of war was held by wei on the eve

of a farreaching campaign he had all his calculations ready those

generals who made use of them did not lose one battle in ten

those who ran counter to them in any particular saw their armies

incontinently beaten and put to flight tsao kungs notes on sun

tz models of austere brevity are so thoroughly characteristic

of the stern commander known to history that it is hard indeed to

conceive of them as the work of a mere littrateur sometimes

indeed owing to extremexxxvi compression they are scarcely intelligible

and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text itself as

we have seen tsao kung is the reputed author of the  a book on

war in  odd words now lost but mentioned in the 
  mng shih the commentary which has come down to us under this

name is comparatively meagre and nothing about the author is known

even his personal name has not been recorded chi tienpaos edition

places him after chia lin and  chao kungwu also assigns him to

the tang dynasty but this is obviously a mistake as his work is

mentioned in the  in sun hsingyens preface he appears as

mng shih of the liang dynasty  others would identify him

with  mng kang of the rd century in the  he is

named last of the  five commentators the others being wei wu ti

tu mu chn hao and chia lin
  li chan of the th century was a wellknown writer on

military tactics his  has been in constant use down to the

present day the  mentions  lives of famous generals from

the chou to the tang dynasty as written by him he is also

generally supposed to be the real author of the popular taoist

tract the  according to chao kungwu and the tieniko

catalogue he followed the  text of sun tz which differs

considerably from thosexxxvii now extant his notes are mostly short and to

the point and he frequently illustrates his remarks by anecdotes from

chinese history
  tu yu died  did not publish a separate commentary on sun

tz his notes being taken from the tung tien the encyclopaedic

treatise on the constitution which was his lifework they are largely

repetitions of tsao kung and mng shih besides which it is believed

that he drew on the ancient commentaries of  wang ling and others

owing to the peculiar arrangement of the tung tien he has to explain

each passage on its merits apart from the context and sometimes his

own explanation does not agree with that of tsao kung whom he always

quotes first though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the ten

commentators he was added to their number by chi tienpao being

wrongly placed after his grandson tu mu
  tu mu  is perhaps best known as a poeta bright star

even in the glorious galaxy of the tang period we learn from chao

kungwu that although he had no practical experience of war he was

extremely fond of discussing the subject and was moreover well read

in the military history of the chun chiu and chan kuo eras

his notes therefore are well worth attention they are very copious

and replete with historical parallels the gist of sun tzs work is

thus summarised by him practise benevolence and justice but on the

other hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency

he further declared that all the militaryxxxviii triumphs and disasters of

the thousand years which had elapsed since sun wus death would upon

examination be found to uphold and corroborate in every particular

the maxims contained in his book tu mus somewhat spiteful

charge against tsao kung has already been considered elsewhere
  chn hao appears to have been a contemporary of tu mu chao

kungwu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on sun tz

because tsao kungs on the one hand was too obscure and subtle and

that of tu mu on the other too longwinded and diffuse ouyang

hsiu writing in the middle of the th century calls tsao kung tu

mu and chn hao the three chief commentators on sun tz  and

observes that chn hao is continually attacking tu mus shortcomings

his commentary though not lacking in merit must rank below those of

his predecessors
  chia lin is known to have lived under the tang dynasty for

his commentary on sun tz is mentioned in the  and was afterwards

republished by  chi hsieh of the same dynasty together with those

of mng shih and tu yu it is of somewhat scanty texture and in

point of quality too perhaps the least valuable of the eleven
  mei yaochn  commonly known by his style

as mei  shngy was like tu mu a poet of distinction his

commentary was published with a laudatory preface by the great ouyang

hsiu from which we may cull the following
later scholars have misread sun tz distorting his words and

trying to make them square with their own onesided views thus

thoughxxxix commentators have not been lacking only a few have proved

equal to the task my friend shngy has not fallen into this

mistake in attempting to provide a critical commentary for sun

tzs work he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings

were intended for states engaged in internecine warfare that the

author is not concerned with the military conditions prevailing

under the sovereigns of the three ancient dynasties nor with

the nine punitive measures prescribed to the minister of war

again sun wu loved brevity of diction but his meaning is always

deep whether the subject be marching an army or handling

soldiers or estimating the enemy or controlling the forces of

victory it is always systematically treated the sayings are

bound together in strict logical sequence though this has been

obscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their

meaning in his own commentary mei shngy has brushed aside all

the obstinate prejudices of these critics and has tried to bring

out the true meaning of sun tz himself in this way the clouds

of confusion have been dispersed and the sayings made clear i am

convinced that the present work deserves to be handed down side by

side with the three great commentaries and for a great deal that

they find in the sayings coming generations will have constant

reason to thank my friend shngy
making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship i am inclined

to endorse this favourable judgment and would certainly place him

above chn hao in order of merit
xl
  wang hsi also of the sung dynasty is decidedly original

in some of his interpretations but much less judicious than mei

yaochn and on the whole not a very trustworthy guide he is fond

of comparing his own commentary with that of tsao kung but the

comparison is not often flattering to him we learn from chao kungwu

that wang hsi revised the ancient text of sun tz filling up lacunae

and correcting mistakes
  ho yenhsi of the sung dynasty the personal name of this

commentator is given as above by  chng chiao in the tung chih

written about the middle of the twelfth century but he appears simply

as  ho shih in the y hai and ma tuanlin quotes chao kungwu

as saying that his personal name is unknown there seems to be no

reason to doubt chng chiaos statement otherwise i should have

been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one 

ho chfei the author of a short treatise on war entitled 

who lived in the latter part of the th century ho shihs

commentary in the words of the tieniko catalogue 

contains helpful additions here and there but is chiefly remarkable

for the copious extracts taken in adapted form from the dynastic

histories and other sources
  chang y the list closes with a commentator of no great

originality perhaps but gifted with admirable powers of lucid

exposition his commentary is based on that of tsao kung whose terse

sentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion

without chang y it is safe to say that much of tsao kungs

commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and

therefore valueless his work is not mentioned in the sung history

the tung kao orxli the y hai but it finds a niche in the tung

chih which also names him as the author of the  lives of

famous generals
it is rather remarkable that the lastnamed four should all have

flourished within so short a space of time chao kungwu accounts for

it by saying during the early years of the sung dynasty the empire

enjoyed a long spell of peace and men ceased to practise the art

of war but when chao yanhaos rebellion came  and the

frontier generals were defeated time after time the court made

strenuous enquiry for men skilled in war and military topics became

the vogue amongst all the high officials hence it is that the

commentators of sun tz in our dynasty belong mainly to that

period
besides these eleven commentators there are several others whose work

has not come down to us the sui shu mentions four namely  wang

ling often quoted by tu yu as   chang tzshang  chia

hs of  wei and  shn yu of  wu the tang shu adds

 sun hao and the tung chih  hsiao chi while the tu shu

mentions a ming commentator  huang juny it is possible that

some of these may have been merely collectors and editors of other

commentaries like chi tienpao and chi hsieh mentioned above

certainly in the case of the latter the entry  in the tung

kao without the following note would give one to understand that

he had written an independent commentary of his own
there are two works described in the ssu ku chanxlii shu and no

doubt extremely rare which i should much like to have seen one is

entitled  in  chan it gives selections from four new

commentators probably of the ming dynasty as well as from the eleven

known to us the names of the four are  hsieh yan  chang ao

 li tsai and  huang chihchng the other work is 

in  chan compiled by  chng tuan of the present dynasty it is

a compendium of information on ancient warfare with special reference

to sun tzs  chapters
appreciations of sun tz
sun tz has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of

chinas greatest men among the famous generals who are known to have

studied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned  han hsin d

bc   fng i d ad   l mng d

 and  yo fei  the opinion of tsao kung

who disputes with han hsin the highest place in chinese military

annals has already been recorded still more remarkable in one

way is the testimony of purely literary men such as  su hsn the

father of su tungpo who wrote several essays on military topics

all of which owe their chief inspiration to sun tz the following

short passage by him is preserved in the y hai
xliii
sun wus saying that in war one cannot make certain of

conquering is very different indeed from what other books

tell us wu chi was a man of the same stamp as sun wu they

both wrote books on war and they are linked together in popular

speech as sun and wu but wu chis remarks on war are less

weighty his rules are rougher and more crudely stated and there

is not the same unity of plan as in sun tzs work where the

style is terse but the meaning fully brought out
the  ch  contains the following extract from the 

impartial judgments in the garden of literature by  chng hou
sun tzs  chapters are not only the staple and base of all

military mens training but also compel the most careful

attention of scholars and men of letters his sayings are terse

yet elegant simple yet profound perspicuous and eminently

practical such works as the lun y the i ching and the great

commentary as well as the writings of mencius hsn kuang

and yang chu all fall below the level of sun tz
chu hsi commenting on this fully admits the first part of the

criticism although he dislikes the audacious comparison with

the venerated classical works language of this sort he says

encourages a rulers bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless

militarism
apologies for war
accustomed as we are to think of china as the greatest peaceloving

nation on earth we are in some danger ofxliv forgetting that her

experience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern

state can parallel her long military annals stretch back to a point

at which they are lost in the mists of time she had built the great

wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier

centuries before the first roman legionary was seen on the danube

what with the perpetual collisions of the ancient feudal states

the grim conflicts with huns turks and other invaders after the

centralisation of government the terrific upheavals which accompanied

the overthrow of so many dynasties besides the countless rebellions

and minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one

by one it is hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never

ceased to resound in one portion or another of the empire
no less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom

china can point with pride as in all countries the greatest are

found emerging at the most fateful crises of her history thus po

chi stands out conspicuous in the period when chin was entering upon

her final struggle with the remaining independent states the stormy

years which followed the breakup of the chin dynasty are illumined

by the transcendent genius of han hsin when the house of han in turn

is tottering to its fall the great and baleful figure of tsao tsao

dominates the scene and in the establishment of the tang dynasty

one of the mightiest tasks achieved by man the superhuman energy of

li shihmin afterwards the emperor tai tsung was seconded by the

brilliant strategy of li ching none of these generals need fear

comparison with the greatest names in the military history of europe
in spite of all this the great body of chinese sentiment from lao

tz downwards and especially as reflected in the standard literature

of confucianism has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed

to militarism in any form it is such an uncommon thing to find any of

the literatixlv defending warfare on principle that i have thought it

worth while to collect and translate a few passages in which the

unorthodox view is upheld the following by ssma chien shows that

for all his ardent admiration of confucius he was yet no advocate of

peace at any price
military weapons are the means used by the sage to punish

violence and cruelty to give peace to troublous times to remove

difficulties and dangers and to succour those who are in peril

every animal with blood in its veins and horns on its head will

fight when it is attacked how much more so will man who carries

in his breast the faculties of love and hatred joy and anger

when he is pleased a feeling of affection springs up within him

when angry his poisoned sting is brought into play that is the

natural law which governs his being what then shall be said of

those scholars of our time blind to all great issues and without

any appreciation of relative values who can only bark out their

stale formulas about virtue and civilisation condemning the

use of military weapons they will surely bring our country to

impotence and dishonour and the loss of her rightful heritage or

at the very least they will bring about invasion and rebellion

sacrifice of territory and general enfeeblement yet they

obstinately refuse to modify the position they have taken up the

truth is that just as in the family the teacher must not spare

the rod and punishments cannot be dispensed with in the state so

military chastisement can never be allowed to fall into abeyance

in the empire all one can say is that this power will be

exercised wisely by some foolishly by others and that among

those who bear arms some will be loyal and others rebellious
the next piece is taken from tu mus preface to his commentary on

sun tz
war may be defined as punishment which is one of the functions of

government it was the profession of chung yu and jan chiu bothxlvi

disciples of confucius nowadays the holding of trials and

hearing of litigation the imprisonment of offenders and their

execution by flogging in the marketplace are all done by

officials but the wielding of huge armies the throwing down of

fortified cities the haling of women and children into captivity

and the beheading of traitorsthis is also work which is done by

officials the objects of the rack and of military weapons

are essentially the same there is no intrinsic difference between

the punishment of flogging and cutting off heads in war for the

lesser infractions of law which are easily dealt with only a

small amount of force need be employed hence the institution of

torture and flogging for more serious outbreaks of lawlessness

which are hard to suppress a greater amount of force is

necessary hence the use of military weapons and wholesale

decapitation in both cases however the end in view is to get

rid of wicked people and to give comfort and relief to the

good
chisun asked jan yu saying have you sir acquired your

military aptitude by study or is it innate jan yu replied it

has been acquired by study how can that be so said

chisun seeing that you are a disciple of confucius it is a

fact replied jan yu i was taught by confucius it is fitting

that the great sage should exercise both civil and military

functions though to be sure my instruction in the art of fighting

has not yet gone very far
now who the author was of this rigid distinction between the

civil and the military and the limitation of each to a

separate sphere of action or in what year of which dynasty it

was first introduced is more than i can say but at any rate

it has come about that the members of the governing class are

quite afraid of enlarging on military topics or do so only in a

shamefaced manner if any are bold enough to discuss the subject

they are at once set down as eccentric individuals of coarse and

brutal propensities this is an extraordinary instance of the way

inxlvii which through sheer lack of reasoning men unhappily lose

sight of fundamental principles
when the duke of chou was minister under chng wang he

regulated ceremonies and made music and venerated the arts of

scholarship and learning yet when the barbarians of the river huai

revolted he sallied forth and chastised them when confucius

held office under the duke of lu and a meeting was convened at

chiaku he said if pacific negotiations are in progress

warlike preparations should have been made beforehand he rebuked

and shamed the marquis of chi who cowered under him and dared

not proceed to violence how can it be said that these two great

sages had no knowledge of military matters
we have seen that the great chu hsi held sun tz in high esteem he

also appeals to the authority of the classics
our master confucius answering duke ling of wei said i have

never studied matters connected with armies and battalions

replying to kung wntz he said i have not been instructed

about buffcoats and weapons but if we turn to the meeting

at chiaku we find that he used armed force against the men

of lai so that the marquis of chi was overawed again when

the inhabitants of pi revolted he ordered his officers to attack

them whereupon they were defeated and fled in confusion

he once uttered the words if i fight ixlviii conquer and

jan yu also said the sage exercises both civil and military

functions can it be a fact that confucius never studied or

received instruction in the art of war we can only say that he

did not specially choose matters connected with armies and

fighting to be the subject of his teaching
sun hsingyen the editor of sun tz writes in similar strain
confucius said i am unversed in military matters he also

said if i fight i conquer confucius ordered ceremonies

and regulated music now war constitutes one of the five

classes of state ceremonial and must not be treated as an

independent branch of study hence the words i am unversed in

must be taken to mean that there are things which even an inspired

teacher does not know those who have to lead an army and devise

stratagems must learn the art of war but if one can command the

services of a good general like sun tz who was employed by wu

tzhs there is no need to learn it oneself hence the remark

added by confucius if i fight i conquer
the men of the present day however wilfully interpret these

words of confucius in their narrowest sense as though he meant

that books on the art of war were not worth reading with blind

persistency they adduce the example of chao kua who pored over

his fathers books to no purpose as a proof that all

military theory is useless again seeingxlix that books on war have

to do with such things as opportunism in designing plans and

the conversion of spies they hold that the art is immoral and

unworthy of a sage these people ignore the fact that the studies

of our scholars and the civil administration of our officials

also require steady application and practice before efficiency is

reached the ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere

novices to botch their work weapons are baneful and

fighting perilous and unless a general is in constant practice

he ought not to hazard other mens lives in battle hence it

is essential that sun tzs  chapters should be studied
hsiang liang used to instruct his nephew chi in the art of

war chi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings

but would not pursue his studies to their proper outcome the

consequence being that he was finally defeated and overthrown he

did not realise that the tricks and artifices of war are beyond

verbal computation duke hsiang of sung and king yen of

hs were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity

the treacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use

of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion there is a case on

record of confucius himself having violated an extorted oath

and also of his having left the sung state in disguise can

we then recklessly arraign sun tz for disregarding truth and

honesty

bibliography
the following are the oldest chinese treatises on war after sun tz

  ssma fa in  chan or  chapters wrongly attributed to

be early as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly

to be met with in its pages see shih chi ch 
the ss ku chan shu ch  f  remarks that the oldest three

treatises on war sun tz wu tz and the ssma fa are

generally speaking only concerned with things strictly militarythe

art of producing collecting training and drilling troops and the

correct theory with regard to measures of expediency laying plans

transport of goods and the handling of soldiersin strong contrast

to later works in which the science of war is usually blended with

metaphysics divination and magical arts in general
  liu tao in  chan or  chapters attributed to  l

wang or l  shang also known as  tai kung of the th century

bc butli its style does not belong to the era of the three

dynasties  lu tming  ad mentions the work and

enumerates the headings of the six sections      and 

so that the forgery cannot have been later than the sui dynasty
  wei liao tz in  chan attributed to wei liao th cent

 mentions a book of wei liao in  chapters whereas the text we

possess contains only  its matter is sound enough in the main

though the strategical devices differ considerably from those of the

warring states period it has been furnished with a commentary by

the wellknown sung philosopher  chang tsai

legendary personage who is said to have bestowed it on chang liang

style is not that of works dating from the chin or han period the

han emperor kuang wu ad  apparently quotes from it in one of

his proclamations but the passage in question may have been inserted

later on in order to prove the genuineness of the work we shall not

be far out if we refer it to the northern sung period  ad

or somewhat earlier
lii
  li wei kung wn tui in  sections written in the form

of a dialogue between tai tsung and his great general  li ching

it is usually ascribed to the latter competent authorities consider

it a forgery though the author was evidently well versed in the art

of war
  li ching ping fa not to be confounded with the foregoing

is a short treatise in  chapters preserved in the tung tien but

not published separately this fact explains its omission from the

of the han dynasty d bc  and said to have been eulogised by

the celebrated general  ma lung d ad  yet the earliest

mention of it is in the  although a forgery the work is well put

together
considering the high popular estimation in which  chuko liang

has always been held it is not surprising to find more than one work

on war ascribed to his pen such are  the  shih liu ts 

chan preserved in the  yung lo ta tien   chiang

yan  ch and   hsin shu  ch which steals wholesale

from sun tz none of these has the slightest claim to be considered

genuine

laying plans

this is the only possible meaning of  which m amiot and capt

calthrop wrongly translate fondements de lart militaire and

first principles respectively tsao kung says it refers to the

deliberations in the temple selected by the general for his

temporary use or as we should say in his tent see  
 
sun tz said the art of war is of vital importance to the state
 
it is a matter of life and death a road either to safety or to ruin

hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected
 
the art of war then is governed by five constant factors to be

taken into account in ones deliberations when seeking to determine

the conditions obtaining in the field
the old text of the tung tien has  etc later

editors have inserted  after  and  before  the former

correction is perhaps superfluous but the latter seems necessary

in order to make sense and is supported by the accepted reading

in   where the same words recur i am inclined to think

however that the whole sentence from  to  is an interpolation

and has no business here at all if it be retained wang hsi must

be right in saying that  denotes the seven considerations in 

  are the circumstances or conditions likely to bring about

victory or defeat the antecedent of the first  is  of the

second   contains the idea of comparison with the enemy

which cannot well be brought out here but will appear in  

altogether difficult though it is the passage is not so

hopelessly corrupt as to justify capt calthrop in burking it

entirely
 
these are  the moral law  heaven  earth  the

commander  method and discipline
it appears from what follows that sun tz means by  a principle

of harmony not unlike the tao of lao tz in its moral aspect one

might be tempted to render it by morale were it not considered

as an attribute of the ruler in  
 
 
the moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with their

ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives

undismayed by any danger
the original text omits  inserts an  after each  and

omits  after  capt calthrop translates if the ruling

authority be upright the people are uniteda very pretty

sentiment but wholly out of place in what purports to be a

translation of sun tz
 
heaven signifies night and day cold and heat times and seasons
the commentators i think make an unnecessary mystery of 

thus mng shih defines the words as  the hard and the

soft waxing and waning which does not help us much wang hsi

however may be right in saying that what is meant is  the

general economy of heaven including the five elements the four

seasons wind and clouds and other phenomena
 
earth comprises distances great and small danger and security

open ground and narrow passes the chances of life and death
 omitted by capt calthrop may have been included here

because the safety of an army depends largely on its quickness to

turn these geographical features to account

 
the commander stands for the virtues of wisdom sincerity

benevolence courage and strictness
the five cardinal virtues of the chinese are   humanity or

benevolence   uprightness of mind   selfrespect

selfcontrol or proper feeling   wisdom   sincerity

or good faith here  and  are put before  and the two

military virtues of courage and strictness substituted for 

and 
 
by method and discipline are to be understood the marshalling of the

army in its proper subdivisions the gradations of rank among the

officers the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the

army and the control of military expenditure
the chinese of this sentence is so concise as to be practically

unintelligible without commentary i have followed the

interpretation of tsao kung who joins  and again  others

take each of the six predicates separately  has the somewhat

uncommon sense of cohort or division of an army capt calthrop

translates partition and ordering of troops which only covers


 
these five heads should be familiar to every general he who knows

them will be victorious he who knows them not will fail
 
therefore in your deliberations when seeking to determine the

military conditions let them be made the basis of a comparison in

this wise
the y lan has an interpolated  before  it is obvious

however that the  just enumerated cannot be described as 

capt calthrop forced to give some rendering of the words which

he had omitted in   shows himself decidedly hazy further

with regard to these and the following seven matters the

condition of the enemy must be compared with our own he does not

appear to see that the seven queries or considerations which

follow arise directly out of the five heads instead of being

supplementary to them

 
 which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law
ie is in harmony with his subjects cf  
 which of the two generals has most ability
 with whom lie the advantages derived from heaven and earth
see   
 on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced
tu mu alludes to the remarkable story of tsao tsao ad

 who was such a strict disciplinarian that once in

accordance with his own severe regulations against injury to

standing crops he condemned himself to death for having allowed

his horse to shy into a field of corn however in lieu of losing

his head he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by

cutting off his hair tsao tsaos own comment on the present

passage is characteristically curt  when you lay

down a law see that it is not disobeyed if it is disobeyed the

offender must be put to death
 which army is the stronger
morally as well as physically as mei yaochn puts it 

which might be freely rendered esprit de corps and big

battalions
 on which side are officers and men more highly trained
tu yu quotes  as saying without constant practice the

officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle

without constant practice the general will be wavering and

irresolute when the crisis is at hand
 in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and

punishment
 literally clear that is on which side is there the most

absolute certainty that merit will be properly rewarded and

misdeeds summarily punished
 
by means of these seven considerations i can forecast victory or defeat

 
the general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it will

conquerlet such a one be retained in command the general that

hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it will suffer defeatlet

such a one be dismissed
the form of this paragraph reminds us that sun tzs treatise was

composed expressly for the benefit of his patron  ho l king of

the wu state it is not necessary however to understand  before

 as some commentators do or to take  as generals under my

command
 
while heeding the profit of my counsel avail yourself also of any

helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules
capt calthrop blunders amazingly over this sentence wherefore with

regard to the foregoing considering that with us lies the advantage

and the generals agreeing we create a situation which promises

victory mere logic should have kept him from penning such frothy

balderdash
 
according as circumstances are favourable one should modify ones

plans
sun tz as a practical soldier will have none of the bookish

theoric he cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract

principles for as chang y puts it while the main laws of

strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and

sundry you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting

to secure a favourable position in actual warfare on the eve of the

battle of waterloo lord uxbridge commanding the cavalry went to the

duke of wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations

were for the morrow because as he explained he might suddenly find

himself commanderinchief and would be unable to frame new plans in a

critical moment the duke listened quietly and then said who will

attack the first tomorrowi or bonaparte bonaparte replied lord

uxbridge well continued the duke bonaparte has not given me any

idea of his projects and as my plans will depend upon his how can

you expect me to tell you what mine are

 
all warfare is based on deception
the truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by

every soldier col henderson tells us that wellington great in

so many military qualities was especially distinguished by the

extraordinary skill with which he concealed his movements and

deceived both friend and foe
 
hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our

forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the

enemy believe we are far away when far away we must make him believe

we are near
 
hold out baits to entice the enemy feign disorder and crush him
 as often in sun tz is used in the sense of  it is rather

remarkable that all the commentators with the exception of chang

y refer  to the enemy when he is in disorder crush him it

is more natural to suppose that sun tz is still illustrating the

uses of deception in war
 
if he is secure at all points be prepared for him if he is in

superior strength evade him
the meaning of  is made clear from chap vi where it is opposed

to  weak or vulnerable spots  according to tu yu and other

commentators has reference to the keenness of the men as well as

to numerical superiority capt calthrop evolves an

extraordinarily farfetched translation if there are defects

give an appearance of perfection and awe the enemy pretend to be

strong and so cause the enemy to avoid you
 
if your opponent is of choleric temper seek to irritate him pretend

to be weak that he may grow arrogant
i follow chang y in my interpretation of   is expanded by mei

yaochn into  wang tz quoted by tu yu says that the

good tactician plays with his adversary as a cat plays with a

mouse first feigning weakness and immobility and then suddenly

pouncing upon him
 
if he is taking his ease give him no rest
this is probably the meaning though mei yaochn has the note

 while we are taking our ease wait for the enemy

to tire himself out the y lan has  lure him on and

tire him out this would seem also to have been tsao kungs

text judging by his comment 
if his forces are united separate them
less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the

commentators if sovereign and subject are in accord put

division between them
 
attack him where he is unprepared appear where you are not expected
 
these military devices leading to victory must not be divulged

beforehand
this seems to be the way in which tsao kung understood the

passage and is perhaps the best sense to be got out of the text

as it stands most of the commentators give the following

explanation it is impossible to lay down rules for warfare

before you come into touch with the enemy this would be very

plausible if it did not ignore  which unmistakably refers to the

maxims which sun tz has been laying down it is possible of

course that  may be a later interpolation in which case the

sentence would practically mean success in warfare cannot be

taught as an alternative however i would venture to suggest

that a second  may have fallen out after  so that we get

these maxims for succeeding in war are the first that ought to be

imparted
 


now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his

temple ere the battle is fought

chang y tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a

temple to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to

take the field in order that he might there elaborate his plan of

campaign capt calthrop misunderstands it as the shrine of the

ancestors and gives a loose and inaccurate rendering of the

whole passage
the general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand

thus do many calculations lead to victory and few calculations to

defeat how much more no calculation at all it is by attention to

this point that i can foresee who is likely to win or lose


ii 



waging war

tsao kung has the note  he who wishes to fight

must first count the cost which prepares us for the discovery

that the subject of the chapter is not what we might expect from

the title but is primarily a consideration of ways and means
 


sun tz said in the operations of war where there are in the field a

thousand swift chariots as many heavy chariots and a hundred

thousand mailclad soldiers
the  were lightly built and according to chang y used for

the attack the  were heavier and designed for purposes of

defence li chan it is true says that the latter were light

but this seems hardly probable capt calthrop translates

chariots and supply wagons respectively but is not supported

by any commentator it is interesting to note the analogies

between early chinese warfare and that of the homeric greeks in

each case the warchariot was the important factor forming as it

did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of

footsoldiers with regard to the numbers given here we are

informed that each swift chariot was accompanied by  footmen

and each heavy chariot by  footmen so that the whole army would

be divided up into a thousand battalions each consisting of two

chariots and a hundred men
with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li
 modern li go to a mile the length may have varied slightly

since sun tzs time
the expenditure at home and at the front including entertainment of

guests small items such as glue and paint and sums spent on chariots

and armour will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day
 which follows  in the textus receptus is important as

indicating the apodosis in the text adopted by capt calthrop it

is omitted so that he is led to give this meaningless translation

of the opening sentence now the requirements of war are such

that we need  chariots etc the second  which is

redundant is omitted in the y lan  like  above is

meant to suggest a large but indefinite number as the chinese

have never possessed gold coins it is incorrect to translate it

 pieces of gold
such is the cost of raising an army of  men
capt calthrop adds you have the instruments of victory which

he seems to get from the first five characters of the next sentence
 
when you engage in actual fighting if victory is long in coming the

mens weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped
the y lan omits  but though  is certainly a bold phrase

it is more likely to be right than not both in this place and in

  the tung tien and y lan read  in the sense of to

injure instead of 
if you lay siege to a town you will exhaust your strength
as synonyms to  are given    and 
 
again if the campaign is protracted the resources of the state will

not be equal to the strain
 means literally if there is long exposure of the army

of  in this sense kang hsi cites an instance from the biography

of  tou jung in the hou han shu where the commentary defines

it by  cf also the following from the  

general you have long been exposed to all weathers

 
now when your weapons are dulled your ardour damped your strength

exhausted and your treasure spent other chieftains will spring up to

take advantage of your extremity then no man however wise will be

able to avert the consequences that must ensue
following tu yu i understand  in the sense of to make good

ie to mend but tu mu and ho shih explain it as to make good

plansfor the future
 
thus though we have heard of stupid haste in war cleverness has

never been seen associated with long delays
this concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any

of the commentators tsao kung li chan mng shih tu yu tu

mu and mei yaochn have notes to the effect that a general

though naturally stupid may nevertheless conquer through sheer

force of rapidity ho shih says haste may be stupid but at any

rate it saves expenditure of energy and treasure protracted

operations may be very clever but they bring calamity in their

train wang hsi evades the difficulty by remarking lengthy

operations mean an army growing old wealth being expended an

empty exchequer and distress among the people true cleverness

insures against the occurrence of such calamities chang y says

so long as victory can be attained stupid haste is preferable to

clever dilatoriness now sun tz says nothing whatever except

possibly by implication about illconsidered haste being better

than ingenious but lengthy operations what he does say is

something much more guarded namely that while speed may

sometimes be injudicious tardiness can never be anything but

foolishif only because it means impoverishment to the nation

capt calthrop indulges his imagination with the following

therefore it is acknowledged that war cannot be too short in

duration but though conducted with the utmost art if long

continuing misfortunes do always appear it is hardly worth

while to note the total disappearance of  in this precious

concoction in considering the point raised here by sun tz the

classic example of fabius cunctator will inevitably occur to the

mind that general deliberately measured the endurance of rome

against that of hannibals isolated army because it seemed to him

that the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in

a strange country but it is quite a moot question whether his

tactics would have proved successful in the long run their

reversal it is true led to cannae but this only establishes a

negative presumption in their favour

 
there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged

warfare
the y lan has  instead of evidently the mistake of a scribe
 
it is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that

can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on
that is with rapidity only one who knows the disastrous effects

of a long war can realise the supreme importance of rapidity in

bringing it to a close only two commentators seem to favour this

interpretation but it fits well into the logic of the context

whereas the rendering he who does not know the evils of war

cannot appreciate its benefits is distinctly pointless
 
the skilful soldier does not raise a second levy neither are his

supplywaggons loaded more than twice
once war is declared he will not waste precious time in waiting

for reinforcements nor will he turn his army back for fresh

supplies but crosses the enemys frontier without delay this may

seem an audacious policy to recommend but with all great

strategists from julius caesar to napoleon buonaparte the value

of timethat is being a little ahead of your opponenthas counted

for more than either numerical superiority or the nicest

calculations with regard to commissariat  is used in the sense

of  the tung tien and y lan have the inferior reading 

the commentators explain  by saying that the waggons are

loaded once before passing the frontier and that the army is met

by a further consignment of supplies on the homeward march the

y lan however reads  here as well
 
bring war material with you from home but forage on the enemy thus

the army will have food enough for its needs
 things to be used in the widest sense it includes all the

impedimenta of an army apart from provisions

 
poverty of the state exchequer causes an army to be maintained by

contributions from a distance contributing to maintain an army at a

distance causes the people to be impoverished
the beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the

next though obviously intended to do so the arrangement

moreover is so awkward that i cannot help suspecting some

corruption in the text it never seems to occur to chinese

commentators that an emendation may be necessary for the sense

and we get no help from them here sun tz says that the cause of

the peoples impoverishment is  it is clear therefore that

the words have reference to some system by which the husbandmen

sent their contributions of corn to the army direct but why

should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way except

because the state or government is too poor to do so assuming

then that  ought to stand first in the sentence in order to

balance  the fact that the two words rhyme is significant and

thus getting rid of  we are still left with  which latter

word seems to me an obvious mistake for  poverty in the army

is an unlikely expression especially as the general has just been

warned not to encumber his army with a large quantity of supplies

if we suppose that  somehow got written here instead of  a

very simple supposition as we have  in the next sentence

and that later on somebody scenting a mistake prefixed the gloss

 to  without however erasing  the whole muddle may be

explained my emended text then would be  etc
 
on the other hand the proximity of an army causes prices to go up

and high prices cause the peoples substance to be drained away
 that is as wang hsi says before the army has left its own

territory tsao kung understands it of an army that has already

crossed the frontier capt calthrop drops the  reading 

but even so it is impossible to justify his translation repeated

wars cause high prices
 
when their substance is drained away the peasantry will be afflicted

by heavy exactions

cf mencius vii  xiv  where  has the same meaning as

  was an ancient measure of land the full table as given

by  may not be out of place here          

                         

    according to the chou li there were nine husbandmen

to a  which would assign to each man the goodly allowance of

  of which  now go to an acre what the values of these

measures were in sun tzs time is not known with any certainty

the lineal  however is supposed to have been about  cm 

may include levies of men as well as other exactions
 
 
with this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength the homes of

the people will be stripped bare and threetenths of their incomes

will be dissipated
the y lan omits  i would propose the emended reading

 etc in view of the fact that we have  in the two

preceding paragraphs it seems probable that  is a scribes

mistake for   having been added afterwards to make sense

 literally within the middle plains there is

emptiness in the homes for  cf shih ching ii  vi  and

ii  ii  with regard to  tu mu says 

and wang hsi  that is the people are mulcted not of

 but of  of their income but this is hardly to be

extracted from our text ho shih has a characteristic tag

 the people being regarded as

the essential part of the state and food as the peoples

heaven is it not right that those in authority should value and

be careful of both
while government expenses for broken chariots wornout horses

breastplates and helmets bows and arrows spears and shields

protective mantlets draughtoxen and heavy waggons will amount to

fourtenths of its total revenue

the y lan has several various readings here the more important

of which are  for the less common  read pi  for 

and  for  which latter if right must mean oxen from the

country districts cf supra   for the meaning of  see

note on iii   capt calthrop omits to translate 
 
hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy one

cartload of the enemys provisions is equivalent to twenty of ones

own and likewise a single picul of his provender is equivalent to

twenty from ones own store
because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of

transporting one cartload to the front according to tsao kung a

      or   but according to mng shih   make a

 the  picul consisted of   catties tu mu and others say

  literally beanstalks and straw
 
now in order to kill the enemy our men must be roused to anger that

there may be advantage from defeating the enemy they must have their

rewards
these are two difficult sentences which i have translated in

accordance with mei yaochns paraphrase we may incontinently

reject capt calthrops extraordinary translation of the first

wantonly to kill and destroy the enemy must be forbidden tsao

kung quotes a jingle current in his day  tu

mu says rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see

the advantage of beating the enemy thus when you capture spoils

from the enemy they must be used as rewards so that all your men

may have a keen desire to fight each on his own account chang y

takes  as the direct object of  which is not so good
 
therefore in chariot fighting when ten or more chariots have been

taken those should be rewarded who took the first

capt calthrops rendering is they who are the first to lay

their hands on more than ten of the enemys chariots should be

encouraged we should have expected the gallant captain to see

that such samsonlike prowess deserved something more substantial

than mere encouragement t omits  and has  in place of the

more archaic 
our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy and the

chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours the captured

soldiers should be kindly treated and kept
 
this is called using the conquered foe to augment ones own strength
 
in war then let your great object be victory not lengthy campaigns
as ho shih remarks  war is not a thing to be

trifled with sun tz here reiterates the main lesson which this

chapter is intended to enforce
 
thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the

peoples fate the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be

in peace or in peril
in the original text there is a  before the 


iii 



attack by stratagem






sun tz said in the practical art of war the best thing of all is to

take the enemys country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it

is not so good so too it is better to capture an army entire than

to destroy it to capture a regiment a detachment or a company entire

than to destroy them
a  army corps according to ssma fa consisted nominally of

 men according to tsao kung a  contained  men a 

any number between  and  and a  any number between  and

 for the last two however chang y gives the exact figures

of  and  respectively
 
hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme

excellence supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys

resistance without fighting
here again no modern strategist but will approve the words of the

old chinese general moltkes greatest triumph the capitulation

of the huge french army at sedan was won practically without

bloodshed
 
thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemys plans

ie as li chan says  in their very inception

perhaps the word baulk falls short of expressing the full force

of  which implies not an attitude of defence whereby one might

be content to foil the enemys stratagems one after another but

an active policy of counterattack ho shih puts this very clearly

in his note when the enemy has made a plan of attack against us

we must anticipate him by delivering our own attack first
the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemys forces
isolating him from his allies we must not forget that sun tz in

speaking of hostilities always has in mind the numerous states or

principalities into which the china of his day was split up
the next in order is to attack the enemys army in the field
when he is already in full strength
and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities
the use of the word  is somewhat unusual which may account for

the reading of the modern text 
 
the rule is not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided
another sound piece of military theory had the boers acted upon

it in  and refrained from dissipating their strength before

kimberley mafeking or even ladysmith it is more than probable

that they would have been masters of the situation before the

british were ready seriously to oppose them
the preparation of mantlets movable shelters and various implements

of war will take up three whole months
it is not quite clear what  were tsao kung simply defines them

as  large shields but we get a better idea of them from li

chan who says they were to protect the heads of those who were

assaulting the city walls at close quarters this seems to suggest

a sort of roman testudo ready made tu mu says they were what

are now termed  wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks

according to kang hsi but this is denied by chn hao see

supra ii  the name is also applied to turrets on city

walls of  fn yn we get a fairly clear description from

several commentators they were wooden missileproof structures on

four wheels propelled from within covered over with raw hides

and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls

for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth tu

mu adds that they are now called  wooden donkeys capt

calthrop wrongly translates the term batteringrams i follow

tsao kung in taking  as a verb coordinate and synonymous with

 those commentators who regard  as an adjective equivalent to

 long make  presumably into a noun
and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will

take three months more
the  or  in the modern text were great mounds or ramparts

of earth heaped up to the level of the enemys walls in order to

discover the weak points in the defence and also to destroy the

 fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note tu yu

quotes the tso chuan 
 
the general unable to control his irritation will launch his men to

the assault like swarming ants
capt calthrop unaccountably omits this vivid simile which as

tsao kung says is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants

climbing a wall the meaning is that the general losing patience

at the long delay may make a premature attempt to storm the place

before his engines of war are ready
with the result that onethird of his men are slain while

the town still remains untaken such are the disastrous

effects of a siege
we are reminded of the terrible losses of the japanese before port

arthur in the most recent siege which history has to record the

tung tien reads      for  the

y lan has  capt calthrop does not translate  and

mistranslates 
 
therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemys troops without any

fighting he captures their cities without laying siege to them he

overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field
chia lin notes that he only overthrows the  that is the

government but does no harm to individuals the classical

instance is wu wang who after having put an end to the yin

dynasty was acclaimed father and mother of the people
 
with his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the empire

and thus without losing a man his triumph will be complete
owing to the double meanings of     and  the latter

part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning

and thus the weapon not being blunted by use its keenness

remains perfect chang y says that  is the advantage of a

prosperous kingdom and a strong army
this is the method of attacking by stratagem
 
it is the rule in war if our forces are ten to the enemys one to

surround him if five to one to attack him
straightaway without waiting for any further advantage
if twice as numerous to divide our army into two
note that  does not refer to the enemy as in the two preceding

clauses this sudden change of object is quite common in chinese

tu mu takes exception to the saying and at first sight indeed

it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war tsao kung

however gives a clue to sun tzs meaning 

being two to the enemys one we may use one part of our army in

the regular way and the other for some special diversion for

explanation of  and  see v  note chang y thus further

elucidates the point if our force is twice as numerous as that

of the enemy it should be split up into two divisions one to

meet the enemy in front and one to fall upon his rear if he

replies to the frontal attack he may be crushed from behind if

to the rearward attack he may be crushed in front this is what

is meant by saying that one part may be used in the regular

way and the other for some special diversion tu mu does not

understand that dividing ones army is simply an irregular just

as concentrating it is the regular strategical method and he is

too hasty in calling this a mistake

 
if equally matched we can offer battle
li chan followed by ho shih gives the following paraphrase

 if attackers and attacked are equally matched in

strength only the able general will fight he thus takes  as

though it were  which is awkward
if slightly inferior in numbers we can avoid the enemy
the tu shu has  instead of  which is hardly distinguishable

in sense from  in the next clause the meaning we can watch the

enemy is certainly a great improvement on the above but

unfortunately there appears to be no very good authority for the

variant chang y reminds us that the saying only applies if the

other factors are equal a small difference in numbers is often

more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline
if quite unequal in every way we can flee from him
 
hence though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force in the

end it must be captured by the larger force
in other words cest magnifique mais ce nest pas la guerre
 
now the general is the bulwark of the state if the bulwark is

complete at all points the state will be strong if the bulwark is

defective the state will be weak
 cannot be restricted to anything so particular as in capt

calthrops translation divided in his allegiance it is simply

keeping up the metaphor suggested by  as li chan tersely puts

it  chi gap indicates deficiency if the

generals ability is not perfect ie if he is not thoroughly

versed in his profession his army will lack strength
 
there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his

army

 
 by commanding the army to advance or to retreat being ignorant of

the fact that it cannot obey this is called hobbling the army
tsao kung weakly defines  as  control direct cf  

ad fin but in reality it is one of those graphic metaphors

which from time to time illuminate sun tzs work and is rightly

explained by li chan as   he adds the comment

 it is like tying together the legs of a

thoroughbred so that it is unable to gallop one would naturally

think of the ruler in this passage as being at home and trying

to direct the movements of his army from a distance but the

commentators understand just the reverse and quote the saying of

tai kung  a kingdom should not be

governed from without an army should not be directed from

within of course it is true that during an engagement or when

in close touch with the enemy the general should not be in the

thick of his own troops but a little distance apart otherwise

he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole and give

wrong orders
 
 by attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers

a kingdom being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army

this causes restlessness in the soldiers minds
tsao kungs note is  which may be

freely translated the military sphere and the civil sphere are

wholly distinct you cant handle an army in kid gloves and

chang y says humanity and justice  are the principles on

which to govern a state but not an army opportunism and

flexibility  on the other hand are military rather than

civic virtues  to assimilate the governing of an

armyto that of a state understood the tung tien has 

inserted before  here and in  

 
 by employing the officers of his army without discrimination
that is he is not careful to use the right man in the right place
through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to

circumstances this shakes the confidence of the soldiers
i follow mei yaochn here the other commentators make  etc

refer not to the ruler as in    but to the officers he

employs thus tu yu says  if a general is

ignorant of the principle of adaptability he must not be

entrusted with a position of authority tu mu quotes  the

skilful employer of men will employ the wise man the brave man

the covetous man and the stupid man for the wise man delights in

establishing his merit the brave man likes to show his courage in

action the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages and the

stupid man has no fear of death the tung tien reads 

which tu yu explains as  is utterly defeated capt calthrop

gives a very inaccurate rendering ignorant of the situation of

the army to interfere in its dispositions
 
but when the army is restless and distrustful trouble is sure to come

from the other feudal princes this is simply bringing anarchy into

the army and flinging victory away
most of the commentators take  in the sense of  which it seems

to bear also in the li chi  i   is there given as

its equivalent but legge tries notwithstanding to retain the more

usual sense translating draw  back which is hardly

defensible tu mu and wang hsi however think  means leading

up to the enemys victory
 


thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory  he

will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight
chang y says if he can fight he advances and takes the

offensive if he cannot fight he retreats and remains on the

defensive he will invariably conquer who knows whether it is

right to take the offensive or the defensive
 he will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior

forces
this is not merely the generals ability to estimate numbers

correctly as li chan and others make out chang y expounds the

saying more satisfactorily by applying the art of war it is

possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater and vice

vers the secret lies in an eye for locality and in not letting

the right moment slip thus wu tz says with a superior force

make for easy ground with an inferior one make for difficult

ground
 he will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout

all its ranks
tsao kung refers  less well to sovereign and subjects
 he will win who prepared himself waits to take the enemy

unprepared
 he will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with

by the sovereign
tu yu quotes  as saying  it is the

sovereigns function to give broad instructions but to decide on

battle is the function of the general it is needless to dilate

on the military disasters which have been caused by undue

interference with operations in the field on the part of the home

government napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary

success to the fact that he was not hampered by any central

authoritythat he was in fact  and  in one
victory lies in the knowledge of these five points
literally these five things are knowledge of the principle of

victory
 
hence the saying if you know the enemy and know yourself you need

not fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not

the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat
li chan cites the case of  fu chien prince of  chin who

in  ad marched with a vast army against the  chin emperor

when warned not to despise an enemy who could command the services

of such men as  hsieh an and  huan chung he boastfully

replied i have the population of eight provinces at my back

infantry and horsemen to the number of one million why they

could dam up the yangtsze river itself by merely throwing their

whips into the stream what danger have i to fear nevertheless

his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the  fei river

and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat
if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every

battle
the modern text represented by the  and tu shu has

 which i should be inclined to adopt in preference to  here

though the tung tien and y lan both have the latter chang

y offers the best commentary on  he says that these words

have reference to attack and defence knowing the enemy enables

you to take the offensive knowing yourself enables you to stand

on the defensive he adds  attack is the

secret of defence defence is the planning of an attack it would

be hard to find a better epitome of the rootprinciple of war


iv 



tactical dispositions

 is a very comprehensive and somewhat vague term literally

form body it comes to mean appearance attitude or

disposition and here it is best taken as something between or

perhaps combining tactics and disposition of troops tsao

kung explains it as  marching and

countermarching on the part of the two armies with a view to

discovering each others condition tu mu says it is through

the  dispositions of an army that its condition may be

discovered conceal your dispositions  and your condition

will remain secret which leads to victory show your

dispositions and your condition will become patent which leads

to defeat wang hsi remarks that the good general can

 secure success by modifying his tactics to meet

those of the enemy in the modern text the title of the chapter

appears as  which capt calthrop incorrectly translates the

order of battle
 
sun tz said the good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the

possibility of defeat and then waited for an opportunity of defeating

the enemy
 
to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands but the

opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself
that is of course by a mistake on his part capt calthrop has

the causes of defeat come from within victory is born in the

enemys camp which though certainly an improvement on his

previous attempt is still incorrect

 
thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat
by concealing the disposition of his troops covering up his

tracks and taking unremitting precautions chang y
but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy
the original text reads  which the modern text has

further modified into  capt calthrop makes out the

impossible meaning and further render the enemy incapable of

victory
 
hence the saying one may know how to conquer without being able to

do it
capt calthrop translates the conditions necessary for victory

may be present but they cannot always be obtained which is more

or less unintelligible
 
security against defeat implies defensive tactics ability to defeat

the enemy means taking the offensive
for  i retain the sense which it undoubtedly bears in  

in spite of the fact that the commentators are all against me the

meaning they give he who cannot conquer takes the defensive is

plausible enough but it is highly improbable that  should

suddenly become active in this way an incorrect variant in the

y lan is 
 
standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength attacking

a superabundance of strength
 
the general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret

recesses of the earth
literally hides under the ninth earth which is a metaphor

indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment so that the enemy

may not know his whereabouts the  of this passage have of

course no connection with the  nine situations of chap xi
he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of

heaven
another metaphor implying that he falls on his adversary like a

thunderbolt against which there is no time to prepare this is

the opinion of most of the commentators though tsao kung

followed by tu yu explains  as the hills rivers and other

natural features which will afford shelter or protection to the

attacked and  as the phases of weather which may be turned to

account by the attacking party capt calthrops the skilful in

attack push to the topmost heaven conveys no meaning at all
thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves on the

other a victory that is complete
capt calthrop draws on a fertile imagination for the following

if these precepts be observed victory is certain
 
to see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is

not the acme of excellence
as tsao kung remarks  the thing is to see the plant

before it has germinated to foresee the event before the action

has begun li chan alludes to the story of han hsin who when

about to attack the vastly superior army of  chao which was

strongly entrenched in the city of  chngan said to his

officers gentlemen we are going to annihilate the enemy and

shall meet again at dinner the officers hardly took his words

seriously and gave a very dubious assent but han hsin had

already worked out in his mind the details of a clever stratagem

whereby as he foresaw he was able to capture the city and

inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary for the full story

see  chap   capt calthrop again blunders badly

with a victory even if popularly proclaimed as such by the

common folk may not be a true success
 
neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the

whole empire says well done
true excellence being as tu mu says 

to plan secretly to move surreptitiously to foil the enemys

intentions and baulk his schemes so that at last the day may be

won without shedding a drop of blood sun tz reserves his

approbation for things that




the worlds coarse thumb
and finger fail to plumb








 
to lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength
 is explained as the fur of a hare which is finest in autumn

when it begins to grow afresh the phrase is a very common one in

chinese writers cf mencius i  vii  and chuang tz

 et al
to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight to hear the noise of

thunder is no sign of a quick ear
ho shih gives as real instances of strength sharp sight and quick

hearing  wu huo who could lift a tripod weighing  stone

 li chu who at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects

no bigger than a mustard seed and  shih kuang a blind

musician who could hear the footsteps of a mosquito
 
what the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins

but excels in winning with ease
the original text followed by the tu shu has  but

this is an alteration evidently intended to smooth the awkwardness

of  which means literally one who conquering excels

in easy conquering mei yaochn says he who only sees the

obvious wins his battles with difficulty he who looks below the

surface of things wins with ease
 
hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit

for courage
tu mu explains this very well inasmuch as his victories are

gained over circumstances that have not come to light the world

at large knows nothing of them and he wins no reputation for

wisdom inasmuch as the hostile state submits before there has

been any bloodshed he receives no credit for courage

 
he wins his battles by making no mistakes
chn hao says he plans no superfluous marches he devises no

futile attacks the connection of ideas is thus explained by

chang y one who seeks to conquer by sheer strength clever

though he may be at winning pitched battles is also liable on

occasion to be vanquished whereas he who can look into the future

and discern conditions that are not yet manifest will never make

a blunder and therefore invariably win li chan thinks that the

character  should be  to have doubts but it is better not to

tamper with the text especially when no improvement in sense is

the result
making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory for

it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated
the tu shu omits   is here   chia lin says it is put for

 in the sense of  but this is farfetched capt calthrop

altogether ignores the important word 
 
hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes

defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy
a  counsel of perfection as tu mu truly observes 

need not be confined strictly to the actual ground occupied by the

troops it includes all the arrangements and preparations which a

wise general will make to increase the safety of his army
 
thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle

after the victory has been won whereas he who is destined to defeat

first fights and afterwards looks for victory
ho shih thus expounds the paradox in warfare first lay plans

which will ensure victory and then lead your army to battle if

you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength

alone victory will no longer be assured

 
the consummate leader cultivates the moral law and strictly adheres

to method and discipline
for  and  see supra i  sqq i think that chang y is

wrong in altering their signification here and taking them as

 and  respectively
thus it is in his power to control success
 
in respect of military method we have firstly measurement

secondly estimation of quantity thirdly calculation fourthly

balancing of chances fifthly victory
 
measurement owes its existence to earth estimation of quantity to

measurement calculation to estimation of quantity balancing of

chances to calculation and victory to balancing of chances
it is not easy to distinguish the four terms  very clearly

the first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground

which enable us to  form an estimate of the enemys strength and

to  make calculations based on the data thus obtained we are

thus led to  a general weighingup or comparison of the enemys

chances with our own if the latter turn the scale then  victory

ensues the chief difficulty lies in  which some commentators

take as a calculation of numbers thereby making it nearly

synonymous with  perhaps  is rather a consideration of the

enemys general position or condition  or  while  is

the estimate of his numerical strength on the other hand tu mu

defines  as  and adds  the question

of relative strength having been settled we can bring the

varied resources of cunning into play ho shih seconds this

interpretation which is weakened however by the fact that  is

given as logically consequent on  this certainly points to the

latter being a calculation of numbers of capt calthrops version

the less said the better

 
a victorious army opposed to a routed one is as a pounds weight

placed in the scale against a single grain
literally a victorious army is like an  i  oz weighed

against a  shu  oz a routed army as a shu weighed

against an i the point is simply the enormous advantage which

a disciplined force flushed with victory has over one

demoralised by defeat legge in his note on mencius i  ix 

makes the  to be  chinese ounces and corrects chu hsis

statement that it equalled  oz only but li chan of the tang

dynasty here gives the same figure as chu hsi
 
the onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pentup

waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep so much for tactical

dispositions
the construction here is slightly awkward and elliptical but the

general sense is plain the tu shu omits  a     or

chinese feet


v 



energy

 here is said to be an older form of  sun tz however would

seem to have used the former in the sense of power and the latter

only in the sense of circumstances the fuller title  is found

in the tu shu and the modern text wang hsi expands it into 

the application in various ways of accumulated power and chang y

says  when the soldiers energy has reached its

height it may be used to secure victory
 
sun tz said the control of a large force is the same in principle as

the control of a few men it is merely a question of dividing up their

numbers
that is cutting up the army into regiments companies etc with

subordinate officers in command of each tu mu reminds us of han

hsins famous reply to the first han emperor who once said to

him how large an army do you think i could lead not more than

 men your majesty and you asked the emperor oh he

answered the more the better  chang y gives the

following curious table of the subdivisions of an army men make

a    make a    make a    make a    make a

   make a    make a    make a    make a 

a  or army corps thus works out at  men but cf iii  

note for  see i   it is possible that  in that paragraph

may also be used in the above technical sense
 
fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from

fighting with a small one it is merely a question of instituting

signs and signals

one must be careful to avoid translating  fighting against a

large number no reference to the enemy being intended  is

explained by tsao kung as denoting flags and banners by means of

which every soldier may recognise his own particular regiment or

company and thus confusion may be prevented  he explains as

drums and gongs which from the earliest times were used to sound

the advance and the retreat respectively tu mu defines  as 

marshalling the troops in order and takes  as the flags and

banners wang hsi also dissents from tsao kung referring  to

the ordering of the troops by means of banners drums and gongs

and  to the various names by which the regiments might be

distinguished there is much to be said for this view
 
to ensure that your whole host may withstand the

brunt of the enemys attack and remain unshakenthis

is effected by manuvres direct and indirect
for  there is another reading  all together adopted by

wang hsi and chang y we now come to one of the most interesting

parts of sun tzs treatise the discussion of the  and the 

as it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these

two terms or to render them at all consistently by good english

equivalents it may be as well to tabulate some of the

commentators remarks on the subject before proceeding further li

chan  facing the enemy is chng making

lateral diversions is chi chia lin  in

presence of the enemy your troops should be arrayed in normal

fashion but in order to secure victory abnormal manuvres must be

employed mei yaochn  chi is

active chng is passive passivity means waiting for an

opportunity activity brings the victory itself ho shih

 we must cause the

enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly

designed and vice vers thus chng may also be chi and

chi may also be chng he instances the famous exploit of

han hsin who when marching ostensibly against  linchin now

 chaoi in shensi suddenly threw a large force across the

yellow river in wooden tubs utterly disconcerting his opponent

chien han shu ch  here we are told the march on

linchin was  and the surprise manuvre was  chang y gives

the following summary of opinions on the words military writers

do not all agree with regard to the meaning of chi and chng

 wei liao tz th cent bc says  direct

warfare favours frontal attacks indirect warfare attacks from the

rear tsao kung says going straight out to join battle is a

direct operation appearing on the enemys rear is an indirect

manuvre  li weikung th and th cent ad says in

war to march straight ahead is chng turning movements on the

other hand are chi these writers simply regard chng as

chng and chi as chi they do not note that the two are

mutually interchangeable and run into each other like the two

sides of a circle see infra   a comment of the tang

emperor tai tsung goes to the root of the matter a chi

manuvre may be chng if we make the enemy look upon it as

chng then our real attack will be chi and vice vers

the whole secret lies in confusing the enemy so that he cannot

fathom our real intent to put it perhaps a little more clearly

any attack or other operation is  on which the enemy has had his

attention fixed whereas that is  which takes him by surprise or

comes from an unexpected quarter if the enemy perceives a

movement which is meant to be  it immediately becomes 
 
that the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against

an eggthis is effected by the science of weak points and strong
 literally the hollow and the solid is the title of chap

vi  tuan is the tu shu reading  hsia that of the

standard text it appears from kang hsi that there has been much

confusion between the two characters and indeed it is probable

that one of them has really crept into the language as a mistake

for the other
 
in all fighting the direct method may be used for joining battle but

indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory
chang y says  steadily develop indirect

tactics either by pounding the enemys flanks or falling on his

rear a brilliant example of indirect tactics which decided the

fortunes of a campaign was lord roberts night march round the

peiwar kotal in the second afghan war

 
indirect tactics efficiently applied are inexhaustible as heaven and

earth unending as the flow of rivers and streams
 is the universally accepted emendation for  the reading of

the 
like the sun and moon they end but to begin anew like the four

seasons they pass away but to return once more
tu yu and chang y understand this of the permutations of  and

 but at present sun tz is not speaking of  at all unless

indeed we suppose with  chng yuhsien that a clause

relating to it has fallen out of the text of course as has

already been pointed out the two are so inextricably interwoven

in all military operations that they cannot really be considered

apart here we simply have an expression in figurative language

of the almost infinite resource of a great leader
 
there are not more than five musical notes

yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can

ever be heard
 
there are not more than five primary colours
 blue yellow red white and black
yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever be seen
 
there are not more than five cardinal tastes
 sour acrid salt sweet bitter
yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted

 
in battle there are not more than two methods of attackthe direct

and the indirect yet these two in combination give rise to an endless

series of manuvres
 
the direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn it is like

moving in a circleyou never come to an end who can exhaust the

possibilities of their combination
the tu shu adds  the final  may refer either to the circle

or more probably to the  understood capt calthrop is

wrong with they are a mystery that none can penetrate
 
the onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll

stones along in its course
 
the quality of decision is like the welltimed swoop of a falcon which

enables it to strike and destroy its victim
for  the y lan reads  which is also supported by a

quotation in the  rd cent bc  in this context is a

word which really defies the best efforts of the translator tu

mu says that it is equivalent to  the measurement or

estimation of distance but this meaning does not quite fit the

illustrative simile in   as applied to the falcon it seems to

me to denote that instinct of selfrestraint which keeps the

bird from swooping on its quarry until the right moment together

with the power of judging when the right moment has arrived the

analogous quality in soldiers is the highly important one of being

able to reserve their fire until the very instant at which it

will be most effective when the victory went into action at

trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace she was for several

minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying with

a single gun nelson coolly waited until he was within close

range when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc

on the enemys nearest ships that was a case of 

 
therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset and prompt

in his decision
tu yu defines  here by the word  which is very like decision

in english  is certainly used in a very unusual sense even if

as the commentators say it   this would have reference to the

measurement of distance mentioned above letting the enemy get

near before striking but i cannot help thinking that sun tz

meant to use the word in a figurative sense comparable to our

own idiom short and sharp cf wang hsis note which after

describing the falcons mode of attack proceeds 

this is just how the psychological moment should be seized in

war i do not care for capt calthrops rendering the spirit of

the good fighter is terrifying his occasions sudden
 
energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow decision to the

releasing of the trigger
energy seems to be the best equivalent here for  because the

comparison implies that the force is potential being stored up in

the bent crossbow until released by the finger on the trigger

none of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile
 
amid the turmoil and tumult of battle there may be seeming disorder

and yet no real disorder at all amid confusion and chaos your array

may be without head or tail yet it will be proof against defeat
 literally formation circular is explained by li chan as

 without back or front mei yaochn says the

subdivisions of the army having been previously fixed and the

various signals agreed upon the separating and joining the

dispersing and collecting which will take place in the course of a

battle may give the appearance of disorder when no real disorder

is possible your formation may be without head or tail your

dispositions all topsyturvy and yet a rout of your forces quite

out of the question it is a little difficult to decide whether

 and  should not be taken as imperatives fight in

disorder for the purpose of deceiving the enemy and you will be

secure against real disorder cf i   

 
simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline simulated fear

postulates courage simulated weakness postulates strength
in order to make the translation intelligible it is necessary to

tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the original tsao kung

throws out a hint of the meaning in his brief note 

these things all serve to destroy formation and conceal ones

condition but tu mu is the first to put it quite plainly if

you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on you

must first have perfect discipline if you wish to display

timidity in order to entrap the enemy you must have extreme

courage if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the

enemy overconfident you must have exceeding strength
 
hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of

subdivision
see supra  
concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of

latent energy
it is passing strange that the commentators should understand 

here as circumstancesa totally different sense from that which

it has previously borne in this chapter thus tu mu says

 seeing that we are favourably

circumstanced and yet make no move the enemy will believe that we

are really afraid
masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical

dispositions
chang y relates the following anecdote of kao tsu the first han

emperor wishing to crush the hsiungnu he sent out spies to

report on their condition but the hsiungnu forewarned

carefully concealed all their ablebodied men and wellfed horses

and only allowed infirm soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen

the result was that the spies one and all recommended the emperor

to deliver his attack  lou ching alone opposed them saying

when two countries go to war they are naturally inclined to make

an ostentatious display of their strength yet our spies have seen

nothing but old age and infirmity this is surely some ruse on

the part of the enemy and it would be unwise for us to attack

the emperor however disregarding this advice fell into the trap

and found himself surrounded at  potng

 
thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains

deceitful appearances according to which the enemy will act
tsao kungs note is  make a display of weakness and

want but tu mu rightly points out that  does not refer only to

weakness if our force happens to be superior to the enemys

weakness may be simulated in order to lure him on but if

inferior he must be led to believe that we are strong in order

that he may keep off in fact all the enemys movements should be

determined by the signs that we choose to give him the following

anecdote of  sun pin a descendant of sun wu is related at

length in the  chap  in  bc the  chi state being

at war with  wei sent  tien chi and sun pin against the

general  pang chan who happened to be a deadly personal

enemy of the latter sun pin said the chi state has a

reputation for cowardice and therefore our adversary despises us

let us turn this circumstance to account accordingly when the

army had crossed the border into wei territory he gave orders to

show  fires on the first night  on the next and the

night after only  pang chan pursued them hotly saying to

himself i knew these men of chi were cowards their numbers

have already fallen away by more than half in his retreat sun

pin came to a narrow defile which he calculated that his pursuers

would reach after dark here he had a tree stripped of its bark

and inscribed upon it the words under this tree shall pang

chan die then as night began to fall he placed a strong body

of archers in ambush near by with orders to shoot directly they

saw a light later on pang chan arrived at the spot and

noticing the tree struck a light in order to read what was

written on it his body was immediately riddled by a volley of

arrows and his whole army thrown into confusion the above is tu

mus version of the story the shih chi less dramatically but

probably with more historical truth makes pang chan cut his own

throat with an exclamation of despair after the rout of his army
he sacrifices something that the enemy may snatch at it
 here  
 
by holding out baits he keeps him on the march then with a body of

picked men he lies in wait for him
this would appear to be the meaning if we retain  which mei

yaochn explains as  men of spirit the tu shu reads 

an emendation suggested by  li ching the meaning then would

be he lies in wait with the main body of his troops
 
the clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy and does

not require too much from individuals
tu mu says he first of all considers the power of his army in

the bulk afterwards he takes individual talent into account and

uses each man according to his capabilities he does not demand

perfection from the untalented
hence his ability to pick out the right men and to utilise combined

energy
another reading has  instead of  it would be interesting if

capt calthrop could tell us where the following occurs in the

chinese yet when an opening or advantage shows he pushes it to

its limits
 
when he utilises combined energy his fighting men become as it were

like unto rolling logs or stones for it is the nature of a log or

stone to remain motionless on level ground and to move when on a

slope if fourcornered to come to a standstill but if roundshaped

to go rolling down
tsao kung calls this  the use of natural or inherent

power capt calthrop ignores the last part of the sentence

entirely in its stead he has so await the opportunity and so

act when the opportunity arrivesanother absolutely gratuitous

interpolation the tung tien omits 
 
thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a

round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height so

much on the subject of energy
the tung tien omits  the chief lesson of this chapter in tu

mus opinion is the paramount importance in war of rapid

evolutions and sudden rushes great results he adds can thus

be achieved with small forces


vi 



weak points and strong

chang y attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows

chapter iv on tactical dispositions treated of the offensive

and the defensive chapter v on energy dealt with direct and

indirect methods the good general acquaints himself first with

the theory of attack and defence and then turns his attention to

direct and indirect methods he studies the art of varying and

combining these two methods before proceeding to the subject of

weak and strong points for the use of direct or indirect methods

arises out of attack and defence and the perception of weak and

strong points depends again on the above methods hence the

present chapter comes immediately after the chapter on energy
 
sun tz said whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of

the enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field

and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted
instead of  the y lan has in both clauses the stronger word

 for the antithesis between  and  cf i   where

however  is used as a verb
 
therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy but does

not allow the enemys will to be imposed on him
the next paragraph makes it clear that  does not merely mean as

tu mu says  to make the enemy approach me but rather

to make him go in any direction i please it is thus practically

synonymous with  cf tu mus own note on v   one mark of a

great soldier is that he fights on his own terms or fights not at

all

 
by holding out advantages to him he can cause the enemy to approach

of his own accord or by inflicting damage he can make it impossible

for the enemy to draw near
in the first case he will entice him with a bait in the second

he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have

to defend
 
if the enemy is taking his ease he can harass him
this passage may be cited as evidence against mei yaochns

interpretation of i  
if well supplied with food he can starve him out
 is probably an older form than  the reading of the original

text both are given in the 
if quietly encamped he can force him to move
the subject to  is still  but these clauses would read

better as direct admonitions and in the next sentence we find sun

tz dropping insensibly into the imperative
 
appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly

to places where you are not expected
the original text adopted by the tu shu has  it has

been altered to suit the context and the commentaries of tsao

kung and ho shih who evidently read  the other reading would

mean appear at points to which the enemy cannot hasten but in

this case there is something awkward in the use of  capt

calthrop is wrong of course with appearing where the enemy is not
 
an army may march great distances without distress

if it marches through country where the enemy is not
we must beware of understanding  as uninhabited country

sun tz habitually uses  in the sense of  eg supra  

tsao kung sums up very well  emerge from

the void qd like a bolt from the blue strike at

vulnerable points shun places that are defended attack in

unexpected quarters the difference of meaning between  and 

is worth noting
 
you can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack

places which are undefended
 is of course hyperbolical wang hsi rightly explains it as weak

points that is to say where the general is lacking in capacity or

the soldiers in spirit where the walls are not strong enough or the

precautions not strict enough where relief comes too late or

provisions are too scanty or the defenders are variance amongst

themselves
you can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions

that cannot be attacked
ie where there are none of the weak points mentioned above there

is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this latter

clause tu mu chn hao and mei yaochn assume the meaning to be

in order to make your defence quite safe you must defend even those

places that are not likely to be attacked and tu mu adds how much

more then those that will be attacked taken thus however the

clause balances less well with the precedingalways a consideration in

the highly antithetical style which is natural to the chinese chang

y therefore seems to come nearer the mark in saying he who is

skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven

see iv   making it impossible for the enemy to guard against

him this being so the places that i shall attack are precisely those

that the enemy cannot defend  he who is skilled in defence hides in

the most secret recesses of the earth making it impossible for the

enemy to estimate his whereabouts this being so the places that i

shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack
 
hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know

what to defend and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does not

know what to attack
an aphorism which puts the whole art of war into a nutshell

 
o divine art of subtlety and secrecy through you we learn to be

invisible through you inaudible
literally without form or sound but it is said of course with

reference to the enemy chang y whom i follow draws no sharp

distinction between  and  but tu mu and others think that 

indicates the secrecy to be observed on the defensive and  the

rapidity to be displayed in attack the y lan text differs

considerably from ours reading 
and hence we can hold the enemys fate in our hands
the tung tien has  capt calthrops version of

this paragraph is so remarkable that i cannot refrain from quoting

it in full now the secrets of the art of offence are not to be

easily apprehended as a certain shape or noise can be understood

of the senses but when these secrets are once learnt the enemy

is mastered
 
you may advance and be absolutely irresistible if you make for the

enemys weak points you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your

movements are more rapid than those of the enemy
the second member of the sentence is weak because  is nearly

tautologous with  the y lan reads  for 
 
if we wish to fight the enemy can be forced to an engagement even

though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch all we

need do is to attack some other place that he will be obliged to

relieve
tu mu says if the enemy is the invading party we can cut his

line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have

to return if we are the invaders we may direct our attack

against the sovereign himself it is clear that sun tz unlike

certain generals in the late boer war was no believer in frontal

attacks

 
if we do not wish to fight we can prevent the enemy from engaging us

even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the

ground all we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in

his way
in order to preserve the parallelism with   i should prefer to

follow the tu shu text which inserts  before  this

extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by chia

lin  even though we have constructed neither wall nor

ditch the real crux of the passage lies in   of

course   tsao kung defines  by the word  which is perhaps

a case of obscurum per obscurius li chan however says

 we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions

and tu mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative

anecdotesone of  chuko liang who when occupying 

yangping and about to be attacked by  ssma i suddenly

struck his colours stopped the beating of the drums and flung

open the city gates showing only a few men engaged in sweeping

and sprinkling the ground this unexpected proceeding had the

intended effect for ssma i suspecting an ambush actually drew

off his army and retreated what sun tz is advocating here

therefore is nothing more nor less than the timely use of

bluff capt calthrop translates and prevent the enemy from

attacking by keeping him in suspense which shows that he has not

fully grasped the meaning of 
 
by discovering the enemys dispositions and remaining invisible

ourselves we can keep our forces concentrated while the enemys must

be divided
the conclusion is perhaps not very obvious but chang y after

mei yaochn rightly explains it thus if the enemys

dispositions are visible we can make for him in one body

whereas our own dispositions being kept secret the enemy will be

obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from

every quarter  is here used as an active verb to make to

appear see iv note on heading capt calthrops making feints

is quite wrong

 
we can form a single united body while the enemy must split up into

fractions hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts

of a whole
the original text has  which in accordance with the

tung tien and y lan has been altered as above i adopt the

more plausible reading of the tu shu  in spite of

having to refer  to ourselves and not to the enemy thus tu yu

and mei yaochn both regard  as the undivided force consisting

of so many parts and  as each of the isolated fractions of the

enemy the alteration of  into  can hardly be right though the

true text might conceivably have been 
which means that we shall be many to the enemys few
 
and if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior

one our opponents will be in dire straits
for  the tung tien and y lan have  tu yu followed by

the other commentators arbitrarily defines  as  few and

easy to conquer but only succeeds thereby in making the sentence

absolutely pointless as for capt calthrops translation in

superiority of numbers there is economy of strength its meaning

is probably known to himself alone in justification of my own

rendering of  i would refer to lun y iv  and vii  
 
the spot where we intend to fight must not be made known for then the

enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several

different points
sheridan once explained the reason of general grants victories by

saying that while his opponents were kept fully employed

wondering what he was going to do he was thinking most of what

he was going to do himself
and his forces being thus distributed in many directions the numbers

we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few

 
for should the enemy strengthen his van he will weaken his rear

should he strengthen his rear he will weaken his van should he

strengthen his left he will weaken his right should he strengthen

his right he will weaken his left if he sends reinforcements

everywhere he will everywhere be weak
in frederick the greats instructions to his generals we read

a defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment

those generals who have had but little experience attempt to

protect every point while those who are better acquainted with

their profession having only the capital object in view guard

against a decisive blow and acquiesce in smaller misfortunes to

avoid greater
 
numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible

attacks numerical strength from compelling our adversary to make

these preparations against us
the highest generalship in col hendersons words is to compel

the enemy to disperse his army and then to concentrate superior

force against each fraction in turn
 
knowing the place and the time of the coming battle we may

concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight
there is nothing about defeating anybody in this sentence as

capt calthrop translates what sun tz evidently has in mind is

that nice calculation of distances and that masterly employment of

strategy which enable a general to divide his army for the purpose

of a long and rapid march and afterwards to effect a junction at

precisely the right spot and the right hour in order to confront

the enemy in overwhelming strength among many such successful

junctions which military history records one of the most dramatic

and decisive was the appearance of blcher just at the critical

moment on the field of waterloo

 
but if neither time nor place be known then the left wing will be

impotent to succour the right the right equally impotent to succour

the left the van unable to relieve the rear or the rear to support

the van how much more so if the furthest portions of the army are

anything under a hundred li apart and even the nearest are

separated by several li
the chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in

precision but the mental picture we are required to draw is

probably that of an army advancing towards a given rendezvous in

separate columns each of which has orders to be there on a fixed

date if the general allows the various detachments to proceed at

haphazard without precise instructions as to the time and place

of meeting the enemy will be able to annihilate the army in

detail chang ys note may be worth quoting here if we do not

know the place where our opponents mean to concentrate or the

day on which they will join battle our unity will be forfeited

through our preparations for defence and the positions we hold

will be insecure suddenly happening upon a powerful foe we

shall be brought to battle in a flurried condition and no

mutual support will be possible between wings vanguard or rear

especially if there is any great distance between the foremost

and hindmost divisions of the army
 
though according to my estimate the soldiers of yeh exceed our own in

number that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory
capt calthrop omits  and his translation of the remainder

is flabby and inaccurate as sun tz was in the service of the 

wu state it has been proposed to read  instead of a wholly

unnecessary tampering with the text yeh coincided roughly with

the present province of chehkiang li chan very strangely takes

 not as the proper name but in the sense of  to surpass no

other commentator follows him  belongs to the class of

expressions like  distance  magnitude etc to which

the chinese have to resort in order to express abstract ideas of

degree the tu shu however omits 
i say then that victory can be achieved
alas for these brave words the long feud between the two states

ended in  bc with the total defeat of wu by  kou chien and

its incorporation in yeh this was doubtless long after sun tzs

death with his present assertion compare iv   

which is the obviously mistaken reading of the y lan here

chang y is the only one to point out the seeming discrepancy

which he thus goes on to explain in the chapter on tactical

dispositions it is said one may know how to conquer without

being able to do it whereas here we have the statement that

victory can be achieved the explanation is that in the former

chapter where the offensive and defensive are under discussion

it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared one cannot make

certain of beating him but the present passage refers

particularly to the soldiers of yeh who according to sun tzs

calculations will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of

the impending struggle that is why he says here that victory can

be achieved
 
though the enemy be stronger in numbers we may prevent him from

fighting
capt calthrop quite unwarrantably translates if the enemy be

many in number prevent him etc
scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of

their success
this is the first of four similarly constructed sentences all of

which present decided difficulties chang y explains  as

 this is perhaps the best way of taking the words

though chia lin referring  to ourselves and not the enemy

offers the alternative of  know beforehand all

plans conducive to our success and to the enemys failure
 
rouse him and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity
instead of  the tung tien y lan and also li chans

text have  which the latter explains as the observation of

omens and chia lin simply as watching and waiting  is

defined by tu mu as  and chang y tells us that by noting the

joy or anger shown by the enemy on being thus disturbed we shall

be able to conclude whether his policy is to lie low or the

reverse he instances the action of chuko liang who sent the

scornful present of a womans headdress to ssma i in order to

goad him out of his fabian tactics
force him to reveal himself so as to find out his vulnerable spots
two commentators li chan and chang y take  in the sense

of  put on specious appearances the former says you may

either deceive the enemy by a show of weaknessstriking your

colours and silencing your drums or by a show of strengthmaking

a hollow display of campfires and regimental banners and the

latter quotes v  where  certainly seems to bear this sense

on the other hand i would point to   of this chapter where 

must with equal certainty be active it is hard to choose between

the two interpretations but the context here agrees better i

think with the one that i have adopted another difficulty arises

over  which most of the commentators thinking no doubt of

the  in xi   refer to the actual ground on which the

enemy is encamped the notes of chia lin and mei yaochn

however seem to favour my view the same phrase has a somewhat

different meaning in i  
 
carefully compare the opposing army with your own
tu yu is right i think in attributing this force to  tsao

kung defines it simply as  capt calthrop surpasses himself with

the staggering translation flap the wings can the latin cornu

in its figurative sense have been at the back of his mind
so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is

deficient
cf iv  
 
in making tactical dispositions the highest pitch you can attain is

to conceal them
the piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation  is

perhaps not so much actual invisibility see supra   as

showing no sign of what you mean to do of the plans that are

formed in your brain

conceal your dispositions and you will be safe from the prying of the

subtlest spies from the machinations of the wisest brains
 is expanded by tu mu into  for  see xiii

note on heading he explains  in like fashion

 though the enemy may have clever and

capable officers they will not be able to lay any plans against

us
 
how victory may be produced for them out of the enemys own

tacticsthat is what the multitude cannot comprehend
all the commentators except li chan make  refer to the enemy

so tsao kung   is defined as  the tu shu has

 with the same meaning see iv   the y lan reads 

evidently a gloss
 
all men can see the tactics whereby i conquer but what none can see

is the strategy out of which victory is evolved
ie everybody can see superficially how a battle is won what

they cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which

has preceded the battle it seems justifiable then to render the

first  by tactics and the second by strategy
 
do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory but let

your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances
as wang hsi sagely remarks there is but one rootprinciple 

underlying victory but the tactics  which lead up to it are

infinite in number with this compare col henderson the rules

of strategy are few and simple they may be learned in a week

they may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams

but such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an army like

napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to write like

gibbon

 
military tactics are like unto water for water in its natural course

runs away from high places and hastens downwards
 is  liu choutzs reading for  in the original text
 
so in war the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is

weak
like water taking the line of least resistance
 
water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over

which it flows
the tung tien and y lan read the latter also  the

present text is derived from chng yuhsien
the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is

facing
 
therefore just as water retains no constant shape so in warfare

there are no constant conditions
 
he who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby

succeed in winning may be called a heavenborn captain
 
the five elements
water fire wood metal earth
are not always equally predominant
that is as wang hsi says  they predominate alternately

the four seasons make way for each other in turn
literally have no invariable seat
there are short days and long the moon has its periods of waning and

waxing
cf v   the purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the

want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in

nature the comparison is not very happy however because the

regularity of the phenomena which sun tz mentions is by no means

paralleled in war


vii 



manuvring

the commentators as well as the subsequent text make it clear

that this is the real meaning of  thus li chan says that 

means  marching rapidly to seize an advantage wang hsi

says  striving means striving for an advantage

this being obtained victory will follow and chang y

 the two armies face to face and each striving to

obtain a tactical advantage over the other according to the

latter commentator then the situation is analogous to that of

two wrestlers manuvring for a hold before coming to actual

grips in any case we must beware of translating  by the word

fighting or battle as if it were equivalent to  capt

calthrop falls into this mistake
 
sun tz said in war the general receives his commands from the

sovereign
for  there is another reading  which li chan explains as

 being the reverent instrument of heavens chastisement
 
having collected an army and concentrated his forces he must blend

and harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp
tsao kung takes  as referring to the  or main gate of the

military camp this tu mu tells us was formed with a couple of

flags hung across cf chou li ch xxvii fol  of the

imperial edition   would then mean setting up his 

opposite that of the enemy but chia lins explanation which has

been adopted above is on the whole simpler and better chang y

while following tsao kung adds that the words may also be taken

to mean the establishment of harmony and confidence between the

higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field and he

quotes a saying of wu tz chap  ad init without harmony

in the state no military expedition can be undertaken without

harmony in the army no battle array can be formed in the

historical romance  chap  sun tz himself is

represented as saying to  wu yan 

as a general rule those who are waging war should get rid of all

domestic troubles before proceeding to attack the external foe 

is defined as  it here conveys the notion of encamping after

having taken the field
 
after that comes tactical manuvring than which there is nothing

more difficult
i have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of

tsao kung who says  from the time of

receiving the sovereigns instructions until our encampment over

against the enemy the tactics to be pursued are most difficult

it seems to me that the  tactics or manuvres can hardly be

said to begin until the army has sallied forth and encamped

and chn haos note gives colour to this view for levying

concentrating harmonising and intrenching an army there are

plenty of old rules which will serve the real difficulty comes

when we engage in tactical operations tu yu also observes that

the great difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in

seizing favourable positions
the difficulty of tactical manuvring consists in turning the devious

into the direct and misfortune into gain
 is one of those highly condensed and somewhat enigmatical

expressions of which sun tz is so fond this is how it is

explained by tsao kung  make it appear that

you are a long way off then cover the distance rapidly and arrive

on the scene before your opponent tu mu says hoodwink the

enemy so that he may be remiss and leisurely while you are

dashing along with the utmost speed ho shih gives a slightly

different turn to the sentence although you may have difficult

ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a

drawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of

movement signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two

famous passages across the alpsthat of hannibal which laid italy

at his mercy and that of napoleon two thousand years later which

resulted in the great victory of marengo
 
thus to take a long and circuitous route after enticing the enemy

out of the way and though starting after him to contrive to reach

the goal before him shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation
chia lin understands  as the enemys line of march thus if

our adversarys course is really a short one and we can manage to

divert him from it  either by simulating weakness or by

holding out some small advantage we shall be able to beat him in

the race for good positions this is quite a defensible view

though not adopted by any other commentator  of course  

and  and  are to be taken as verbs tu mu cites the famous

march of  chao sh in  bc to relieve the town of 

oy which was closely invested by a  chin army it should be

noted that the above is the correct pronunciation of  as given

in the commentary on the chien han shu ch  giles

dictionary gives yy and chavannes i know not on what

authority prefers to write yeny the name is omitted

altogether from playfairs cities and towns the king of chao

first consulted  lien po on the advisability of attempting a

relief but the latter thought the distance too great and the

intervening country too rugged and difficult his majesty then

turned to chao sh who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the

march but finally said we shall be like two rats fighting in a

holeand the pluckier one will win so he left the capital with

his army but had only gone a distance of  li when he stopped

and began throwing up intrenchments for  days he continued

strengthening his fortifications and took care that spies should

carry the intelligence to the enemy the chin general was

overjoyed and attributed his adversarys tardiness to the fact

that the beleaguered city was in the han state and thus not

actually part of chao territory but the spies had no sooner

departed than chao sh began a forced march lasting for two days

and one night and arrived on the scene of action with such

astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding

position on the  north hill before the enemy had got wind of

his movements a crushing defeat followed for the chin forces

who were obliged to raise the siege of oy in all haste and

retreat across the border see  chap 
 
manuvring with an army is advantageous with an undisciplined

multitude most dangerous
i here adopt the reading of the tung tien chng yuhsien and the

tu shu where  appears to supply the exact nuance required

in order to make sense the standard text on the other hand in

which  is repeated seems somewhat pointless the commentators

take it to mean that manuvres may be profitable or they may be

dangerous it all depends on the ability of the general capt

calthrop translates  the wrangles of a multitude
 
if you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an

advantage the chances are that you will be too late
the original text has  instead of  but a verb is needed to

balance 
on the other hand to detach a flying column for the purpose involves

the sacrifice of its baggage and stores
 is evidently unintelligible to the chinese commentators who

paraphrase the sentence as though it began with  absolute

tautology in the apodosis can then only be avoided by drawing an

impossibly fine distinction between  and  i submit my own

rendering without much enthusiasm being convinced that there is

some deepseated corruption in the text on the whole it is clear

that sun tz does not approve of a lengthy march being undertaken

without supplies cf infra  
 
thus if you order your men to roll up their buffcoats
 does not mean to discard ones armour as capt calthrop

translates but implies on the contrary that it is to be carried

with you chang y says  this means in full panoply

and make forced marches without halting day or night covering double

the usual distance at a stretch
the ordinary days march according to tu mu was  li but on one

occasion when pursuing  liu pei tsao tsao is said to have

covered the incredible distance of  li within twentyfour hours
doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage the leaders of

all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy
 
the stronger men will be in front the jaded ones will fall behind

and on this plan only onetenth of your army will reach its destination
for  see ii   the moral is as tsao kung and others point

out dont march a hundred li to gain a tactical advantage

either with or without impedimenta manuvres of this description

should be confined to short distances stonewall jackson said

the hardships of forced marches are often more painful than the

dangers of battle he did not often call upon his troops for

extraordinary exertions it was only when he intended a surprise

or when a rapid retreat was imperative that he sacrificed

everything to speed
 
if you march fifty li in order to outmanuvre the enemy you will

lose the leader of your first division and only half your force will

reach the goal
 is explained as similar in meaning to  literally the leader

of the first division will be torn away cf tso chuan  th

year  this is a case of the falling tree tearing up

its roots
 
if you march thirty li with the same object twothirds of your army

will arrive
in the tung tien is added  from this we may know

the difficulty of manuvring

 
we may take it then that an army without its baggagetrain is lost

without provisions it is lost without bases of supply it is lost
 is explained by tu yu as  fodder and the like by tu

mu and chang y as  goods in general and by wang hsi as

 fuel salt foodstuffs etc but i think what sun tz

meant was stores accumulated in dpts as distinguished from

 and  the various impedimenta accompanying an army on its

march cf chou li ch xvi fol    
 
we cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the

designs of our neighbours
   li chan understands it as  guard against which is

hardly so good an original interpretation of  is given by tu mu

who says it stands for  or  join in battle
 
we are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar

with the face of the countryits mountains and forests its pitfalls
 defined as  tsao kung or  chang y
and precipices
 defined as 
its marshes
 defined as 
and swamps
 defined as 
 
we shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we

make use of local guides
  are repeated in chap xi  

 
in war practise dissimulation and you will succeed
according to tu mu  stands for  cf i   in the tactics

of turenne deception of the enemy especially as to the numerical

strength of his troops took a very prominent position
move only if there is a real advantage to be gained
this is the interpretation of all the commentators except wang

hsi who has the brief note  entice out the enemy by

offering him some apparent advantage
 
whether to concentrate or to divide your troops must be decided by

circumstances
 
let your rapidity be that of the wind
the simile is doubly appropriate because the wind is not only

swift but as mei yaochn points out  invisible and

leaves no tracks
your compactness that of the forest
it is hardly possible to take  here in its ordinary sense of

sedate as tu yu tries to do mng shih comes nearer the mark in

his note  when slowly marching order and ranks must be

preservedso as to guard against surprise attacks but natural

forests do not grow in rows whereas they do generally possess the

quality of density or compactness i think then that mei yaochn

uses the right adjective in saying 
 
in raiding and plundering be like fire
cf shih ching iv  iv   fierce as a

blazing fire which no man can check
in immovability like a mountain
that is when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to

dislodge you or perhaps as tu yu says when he is trying to

entice you into a trap

 
let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night and when you move

fall like a thunderbolt
the original text has  instead of  cf iv   tu yu quotes a

saying of tai kung which has passed into a proverb

 you cannot shut your ears to the thunder or

your eyes to the lightningso rapid are they likewise an attack

should be made so quickly that it cannot be parried
 
when you plunder a countryside let the spoil be divided amongst your

men
the reading of tu yu chia lin and apparently tsao kung is

 which is explained as referring to the subdivision of the

army mentioned in v    by means of banners and flags

serving to point out  to each man the way he should go 

but this is very forced and the ellipsis is too great even for

sun tz luckily the tung tien and y lan have the variant

 which not only suggests the true reading  but affords some

clue to the way in which the corruption arose some early

commentator having inserted  as the sound of  the two may

afterwards have been read as one character and this being

interchangeable with   must finally have disappeared

altogether meanwhile  would have been altered to  in order to

make sense as regards  i believe that ho shih alone has

grasped the real meaning the other commentators understanding it

as dividing the men into parties to search for plunder sun tz

wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by

insisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock

which may afterwards be fairly divided amongst all
when you capture new territory cut it up into allotments for the

benefit of the soldiery
that this is the meaning may be gathered from tu mus note

 the  gives the same advice  

means to enlarge or extendat the expense of the enemy

understood cf shih ching iii  vii   hating all

the great states chn hao also says  quarter your

soldiers on the land and let them sow and plant it it is by

acting on this principle and harvesting the lands they invaded

that the chinese have succeeded in carrying out some of their most

memorable and triumphant expeditions such as that of  pan

chao who penetrated to the caspian and in more recent years

those of  fukangan and  tso tsungtang
 
ponder and deliberate
note that both these words like the chinese  are really

metaphors derived from the use of scales
before you make a move
chang y quotes  as saying that we must not break camp until

we have gauged the resisting power of the enemy and the cleverness

of the opposing general cf the seven comparisons in i  

capt calthrop omits this sentence
 
he will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation
see supra   
such is the art of manuvring
with these words the chapter would naturally come to an end but

there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from

an earlier book on war now lost but apparently extant at the

time when sun tz wrote the style of this fragment is not

noticeably different from that of sun tz himself but no

commentator raises a doubt as to its genuineness
 
the book of army management says
it is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators

give us any information about this work mei yaochn calls it

 an ancient military classic and wang hsi  an old

book on war considering the enormous amount of fighting that had

gone on for centuries before sun tzs time between the various

kingdoms and principalities of china it is not in itself

improbable that a collection of military maxims should have been

made and written down at some earlier period

on the field of battle
implied though not actually in the chinese
the spoken word does not carry far enough hence the institution of

gongs and drums
i have retained the words  of the original text which recur in

the next paragraph in preference to the other reading  drums

and bells which is found in the tung tien pei tang shu

chao and y lan  is a bell with a clapper see lun y iii

 chou li xxix    of course would include both gongs

and bells of every kind the tu shu inserts a  after each 
nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough hence the institution

of banners and flags
 
gongs and drums banners and flags are means whereby the ears and

eyes of the host
the original text followed by the tu shu has  for  here

and in the next two paragraphs but as we have seen  is

generally used in sun tz for the enemy
may be focussed on one particular point
note the use of  as a verb chang y says

 if sight and hearing converge

simultaneously on the same object the evolutions of as many as a

million soldiers will be like those of a single man
 
the host thus forming a single united body it is impossible either

for the brave to advance alone or for the cowardly to retreat alone
chang y quotes a saying  equally

guilty are those who advance against orders and those who retreat

against orders tu mu tells a story in this connection of  wu

chi when he was fighting against the chin state before the

battle had begun one of his soldiers a man of matchless daring

sallied forth by himself captured two heads from the enemy and

returned to camp wu chi had the man instantly executed

whereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate saying this man

was a good soldier and ought not to have been beheaded wu chi

replied i fully believe he was a good soldier but i had him

beheaded because he acted without orders
this is the art of handling large masses of men
 
in nightfighting then make much use of signalfires and drums and

in fighting by day of flags and banners as a means of influencing

the ears and eyes of your army
the tung tien has the bad variant  for  with regard to the

latter word i believe i have hit off the right meaning the whole

phrase being slightly elliptical for influencing the movements of

the army through their senses of sight and hearing li chan tu

mu and chia lin certainly seem to understand it thus the other

commentators however take  or  as the enemy and  as

equivalent to  or  to perplex or confound this does

not agree so well with what has gone before though on the other

hand it renders the transition to   less abrupt the whole

question i think hinges on the alternative readings  and 

the latter would almost certainly denote the enemy chn hao

alludes to  li kuangpis night ride to  hoyang at the

head of  mounted men they made such an imposing display with

torches that though the rebel leader  shih ssming had a

large army he did not dare to dispute their passage chn hao

gives the date as  ad  but according to the  new

tang history   it must have been later than this probably


 
a whole army may be robbed of its spirit
in war says chang y if a spirit of anger can be made to

pervade all ranks of an army at one and the same time its onset

will be irresistible now the spirit of the enemys soldiers will

be keenest when they have newly arrived on the scene and it is

therefore our cue not to fight at once but to wait until their

ardour and enthusiasm have worn off and then strike it is in

this way that they may be robbed of their keen spirit li chan

and others tell an anecdote to be found in the tso chuan 

year    of  tsao kuei a protg of duke chuang of lu

the latter state was attacked by chi and the duke was about to

join battle at  changcho after the first roll of the enemys

drums when tsao said not just yet only after their drums had

beaten for the third time did he give the word for attack then

they fought and the men of chi were utterly defeated questioned

afterwards by the duke as to the meaning of his delay tsao kuei

replied in battle a courageous spirit is everything now the

first roll of the drum tends to create this spirit but with the

second it is already on the wane and after the third it is gone

altogether i attacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at

its height hence our victory  chap  puts spirit first

among the four important influences in war and continues

 the value of a whole armya

mighty host of a million menis dependent on one man alone such

is the influence of spirit
a commanderinchief may be robbed of his presence of mind
capt calthrop goes woefully astray with defeat his generals

ambition chang y says  presence

of mind is the generals most important asset it is the quality

which enables him to discipline disorder and to inspire courage

into the panicstricken the great general  li ching ad

 has a saying 

attacking does not merely consist in assaulting walled cities or

striking at an army in battle array it must include the art of

assailing the enemys mental equilibrium  pt 
 
now a soldiers spirit is keenest in the morning
always provided i suppose that he has had breakfast at the

battle of the trebia the romans were foolishly allowed to fight

fasting whereas hannibals men had breakfasted at their leisure

see livy xxi liv  lv  and 
by noonday it has begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent

only on returning to camp
 
a clever general therefore

the  which certainly seems to be wanted here is omitted in the

tu shu
avoids an army when its spirit is keen but attacks it when it is

sluggish and inclined to return this is the art of studying moods
the tung tien for reasons of  avoidance of personal names

of the reigning dynasty reads  for  in this and the two next

paragraphs
 
disciplined and calm to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub

amongst the enemythis is the art of retaining selfpossession
 
to be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it to wait at

ease
the tung tien has  for  the two characters are practically

synonymous but according to the commentary the latter is the

form always used in sun tz
while the enemy is toiling and struggling to be wellfed while the

enemy is famishedthis is the art of husbanding ones strength
 
to refrain from intercepting
 is the reading of the original text but the  quotes the

passage with  yao also meaning to intercept and this is

supported by the pei tang shu chao the y lan and wang

hsis text
an enemy whose banners are in perfect order to refrain from attacking

an army drawn up in calm and confident array
for this translation of  i can appeal to the authority of tu

mu who defines the phrase as  the other commentators mostly

follow tsao kung who says  probably meaning grand and

imposing li chan however has  in subdivisions which is

somewhat strange

this is the art of studying circumstances
i have not attempted a uniform rendering of the four phrases 

  and  though  really bears the same meaning in each

case it is to be taken i think not in the sense of to govern

or control but rather as kang hsi defines it   to

examine and practise hence look after keep a watchful eye

upon we may find an example of this use in the chou li xviii

fol   sun tz has not told us to control or restrain

the quality which he calls  but only to observe the time at

which it is strongest as for  it is important to remember that

in the present context it can only mean presence of mind to

speak of controlling presence of mind is absurd and capt

calthrops to have the heart under control is hardly less so

the whole process recommended here is that of vi   
 
it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to

oppose him when he comes downhill
the y lan reads  for 
 
do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight do not attack soldiers

whose temper is keen
 
do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy
li chan and tu mu with extraordinary inability to see a

metaphor take these words quite literally of food and drink that

have been poisoned by the enemy chn hao and chang y carefully

point out that the saying has a wider application the tung

tien reads  to covet instead of  the similarity of the two

characters sufficiently accounts for the mistake
do not interfere with an army that is returning home
the commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by

saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight

to the death against any attempt to bar his way and is therefore

too dangerous an opponent to be tackled chang y quotes the words

of han hsin  invincible is the soldier who

hath his desire and returneth homewards a marvellous tale is

told of tsao tsaos courage and resource in ch  of the san

kuo chih  in  ad he was besieging  chang hsiu in

 jang when  liu piao sent reinforcements with a view to

cutting off tsaos retreat the latter was obliged to draw off

his troops only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies

who were guarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had

engaged himself in this desperate plight tsao waited until

nightfall when he bored a tunnel into the mountain side and laid

an ambush in it then he marched on with his baggagetrain and

when it grew light chang hsiu finding that the bird had flown

pressed after him in hot pursuit as soon as the whole army had

passed by the hidden troops fell on its rear while tsao himself

turned and met his pursuers in front so that they were thrown

into confusion and annihilated tsao tsao said afterwards

 the brigands tried to check my

army in its retreat and brought me to battle in a desperate

position hence i knew how to overcome them
 
when you surround an army leave an outlet free
this does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape the

object as tu mu puts it is  to make him

believe that there is a road to safety and thus prevent his

fighting with the courage of despair tu mu adds pleasantly

 after that you may crush him
do not press a desperate foe too hard
for  the tu shu reads  pursue chn hao quotes the

saying  birds and beasts when brought to bay will

use their claws and teeth chang y says 

if your adversary has burned his boats and destroyed his

cookingpots and is ready to stake all on the issue of a battle

he must not be pushed to extremities the phrase  doubtless

originated with sun tz the pei wn yn fu gives four examples

of its use the earliest being from the chien han shu and

i have found another in chap  of the same work ho shih

illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of  fu

yenching in ch  of the  that general together with his

colleague  tu chungwei was surrounded by a vastly superior

army of khitans in the year  ad the country was bare and

desertlike and the little chinese force was soon in dire straits

for want of water the wells they bored ran dry and the men were

reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the moisture

their ranks thinned rapidly until at last fu yenching

exclaimed we are desperate men far better to die for our

country than to go with fettered hands into captivity a strong

gale happened to be blowing from the northeast and darkening the

air with dense clouds of sandy dust tu chungwei was for waiting

until this had abated before deciding on a final attack but

luckily another officer  li shouchng by name was quicker

to see an opportunity and said they are many and we are few

but in the midst of this sandstorm our numbers will not be

discernible victory will go to the strenuous fighter and the

wind will be our best ally accordingly fu yenching made a

sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his cavalry routed

the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to safety

certain details in the above account have been added from the

 ch 
 
such is the art of warfare
chng yuhsien in his  inserts  after  i take it that these

words conclude the extract from the  which began at  


viii 



variation of tactics

the heading means literally the nine variations but as sun tz

does not appear to enumerate these and as indeed he has already

told us v   that such deflections from the ordinary

course are practically innumerable we have little option but to

follow wang hsi who says that nine stands for an indefinitely

large number all it means is that in warfare  we ought to

vary our tactics to the utmost degree  i do not know what tsao

kung makes these nine variations out to be the latters note is

 but it has been suggested that they are

connected with the nine situationsof chap xi this is the view

adopted by chang y see note on    the only other

alternative is to suppose that something has been losta

supposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends

some weight
 
sun tz said in war the general receives his commands from the

sovereign collects his army and concentrates his forces
repeated from vii   where it is certainly more in place it

may have been interpolated here merely in order to supply a

beginning to the chapter
 
when in difficult country do not encamp
for explanation of  see xi  
in country where high roads intersect join hands with your allies
see xi    capt calthrop omits 

do not linger in dangerously isolated positions
 is not one of the nine situations as given in the beginning

of chap xi but occurs later on ibid   qv we may

compare it with  xi   chang y calls it a 

situated across the frontier in hostile territory li chan says

it is country in which there are no springs or wells flocks or

herds vegetables or firewood chia lin one of gorges chasms

and precipices without a road by which to advance
in hemmedin situations you must resort to stratagem
see xi    capt calthrop has mountainous and wooded

country which is a quite inadequate translation of 
in a desperate position you must fight
see xi    chang y has an important note here which must

be given in full from  he says down to this point

the nine variations are presented to us the reason why only five

are given is that the subject is treated en prcis 

so in chap xi where he discusses the variations of tactics

corresponding to the nine grounds sun tz mentions only six

variations there again we have an abridgment i cannot

understand what chang y means by this statement he can only be

referring to   or   of chap xi but in both places

all the nine grounds are discussed perhaps he is confusing

these with the six  of chap x all kinds of ground have

corresponding military positions and also a variation of tactics

suitable to each  in chap xi what we find

enumerated first   are the situations afterwards 

 the corresponding tactics now how can we tell that the

 nine variations are simply the  variations of

tactics corresponding to the nine grounds it is said further

on   that the general who does not understand the nine

variations of tactics may be well acquainted with the features

of the country yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to

practical account again in chap xi   we read the

different measures adapted to the nine varieties of ground

 and the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics

must be carefully examined from a consideration of these

passages the meaning is made clear when later on the nine grounds

are enumerated sun tz recurs to these nine variations he wishes

here to speak of the five advantages see infra   so he

begins by setting forth the nine variations these are inseparably

connected in practice and therefore they are dealt with

together the weak point of this argument is the suggestion that

 five things can stand as a  that is an abstract or

abridgment of nine when those that are omitted are not less

important than those that appear and when one of the latter is

not included amongst the nine at all
 
there are roads which must not be followed
especially those leading through narrow defiles says li chan

where an ambush is to be feared
armies which must not be attacked
more correctly perhaps there are times when an army must not be

attacked chn hao says when you see your way to obtain a

trivial advantage but are powerless to inflict a real defeat

refrain from attacking for fear of overtaxing your mens strength
towns
capt calthrop says castlesan unfortunate attempt to introduce

local colour
which must not be besieged
cf iii   tsao kung gives an interesting illustration from

his own experience when invading the territory of  hschou

he ignored the city of  huapi which lay directly in his path

and pressed on into the heart of the country this excellent

strategy was rewarded by the subsequent capture of no fewer than

fourteen important district cities chang y says no town should

be attacked which if taken cannot be held or if left alone

will not cause any trouble  hsn ying when urged to attack

 piyang replied the city is small and wellfortified even

if i succeed in taking it t will be no great feat of arms

whereas if i fail i shall make myself a laughingstock in the

seventeenth century sieges still formed a large proportion of

war it was turenne who directed attention to the importance of

marches countermarches and manuvres he said it is a great

mistake to waste men in taking a town when the same expenditure of

soldiers will gain a province
positions which must not be contested commands of the sovereign which

must not be obeyed
this is a hard saying for the chinese with their reverence for

authority and wei liao tz quoted by tu mu is moved to exclaim
 weapons are baleful instruments

strife is antagonistic to virtue a military commander is the

negation of civil order the unpalatable fact remains however

that even imperial wishes must be subordinated to military

necessity cf iii    x   the tung tien has 

before  etc this is a gloss on the words by chuko liang

which being repeated by tu yu became incorporated with the text

chang y thinks that these five precepts are the  referred

to in   another theory is that the mysterious  are here

enumerated starting with  and ending at  while

the final clause  embraces and as it were sums up all

the nine thus ho shih says even if it be your sovereigns

command to encamp in difficult country linger in isolated

positions etc you must not do so the theory is perhaps a

little too ingenious to be accepted with confidence
 
the general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany

variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops
before  in the original text there is a  which is obviously not

required
 
the general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with

the configuration of the country yet he will not be able to turn his

knowledge to practical account
literally get the advantage of the ground which means not only

securing good positions but availing oneself of natural

advantages in every possible way chang y says every kind of

ground is characterised by certain natural features and also

gives scope for a certain variability of plan how is it possible

to turn these natural features to account unless topographical

knowledge is supplemented by versatility of mind
 
so the student of war who is unversed in the art of varying his

plans even though he be acquainted with the five advantages will

fail to make the best use of his men

tsao kung says that the  are  the five things that

follow but this cannot be right we must rather look back to the

five variations contained in   chia lin who reads  here

to balance the  tells us that these imply five obvious and

generally advantageous lines of action namely if a certain road

is short it must be followed if an army is isolated it must

be attacked if a town is in a parlous condition it must be

besieged if a position can be stormed it must be attempted and

if consistent with military operations the rulers commands must

be obeyed but there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a

general to use these advantages for instance a certain road may

be the shortest way for him but if he knows that it abounds in

natural obstacles or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it he

will not follow that road a hostile force may be open to attack

but if he knows that it is hardpressed and likely to fight with

desperation he will refrain from striking and so on here the

 comes in to modify the  and hence we see the uselessness of

knowing the one without the otherof having an eye for weaknesses

in the enemys armour without being clever enough to recast ones

plans on the spur of the moment capt calthrop offers this

slovenly translation in the management of armies if the art of

the nine changes be understood sic a knowledge of the five

advantages is of no avail
 
hence in the wise leaders plans considerations of advantage and of

disadvantage will be blended together
whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one

says tsao kung the opposite state should be always present to

your mind
 
if our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way we may

succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes
 according to tu mu is equivalent to  and  is

paraphrased by chang y as  tu mu goes on to say if

we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy we must not fix our

minds on that alone but allow for the possibility of the enemy

also doing some harm to us and let this enter as a factor into

our calculations
 
if on the other hand in the midst of difficulties we are always

ready to seize an advantage we may extricate ourselves from misfortune
a translator cannot emulate the conciseness of  to blend

thoughts of advantage with disadvantage but the meaning is as

given tu mu says if i wish to extricate myself from a dangerous

position i must consider not only the enemys ability to injure

me but also my own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy

if in my counsels these two considerations are properly blended

i shall succeed in liberating myself for instance if i am

surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting an escape the

nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pursue and

crush me it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a

bold counterattack and use the advantage thus gained to free

myself from the enemys toils see the story of tsao tsao vii

  note in his first edition capt calthrop translated  

as follows the wise man perceives clearly wherein lies advantage

and disadvantage while recognising an opportunity he does not

overlook the risks and saves future anxiety this has now been

altered into the wise man considers well both advantage and

disadvantage he sees a way out of adversity and on the day of

victory to danger is not blind owing to a needless inversion of

the chinese the words which i have italicised are evidently

intended to represent  
 
reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them
chia lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury some

of which would only occur to the oriental mindentice away the

enemys best and wisest men so that he may be left without

counsellors introduce traitors into his country that the

government policy may be rendered futile foment intrigue and

deceit and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his

ministers by means of every artful contrivance cause

deterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure corrupt

his morals by insidious gifts leading him into excess disturb and

unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women chang y

after wang hsi considers the  to be military chastisement get

the enemy he says into a position where he must suffer injury

and he will submit of his own accord capt calthrop twists sun

tzs words into an absurdly barbarous precept in reducing an

enemy to submission inflict all possible damage upon him
make trouble for them
 is defined by tsao kung as  and his definition is generally

adopted by the commentators tu mu however seems to take it in

the sense of possessions or as we might say assets which

he considers to be  a large army a rich exchequer

harmony amongst the soldiers punctual fulfilment of commands

these give us a whiphand over the enemy
and keep them constantly engaged
 literally make servants of them tu yu says 

prevent them from having any rest
hold out specious allurements and make them rush to any given point
mng shihs note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic

use of   cause them to forget pien the reasons

for acting otherwise than on their first impulse and hasten in

our direction
 
the art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemys

not coming but on our own readiness to receive him
the tung tien and y lan read  but the conciser

form is more likely to be right
not on the chance of his not attacking but rather on the

fact that we have made our position unassailable
the tung tien and y lan insert  after the first  and

omit 
 
there are five dangerous faults which may affect a general 

recklessness which leads to destruction
 bravery without forethought as tsao kung analyses it

which causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad

bull such an opponent says chang y must not be encountered

with brute force but may be lured into an ambush and slain cf

wu tz chap iv ad init 

in estimating the character of a general

men are wont to pay exclusive attention to his courage forgetting

that courage is only one out of many qualities which a general

should possess the merely brave man is prone to fight recklessly

and he who fights recklessly without any perception of what is

expedient must be condemned ssma fa too makes the incisive

remark  simply going to ones death does not bring about

victory
 cowardice which leads to capture
 is explained by tsao kung of the man whom timidity prevents

from advancing to seize an advantage and wang hsi adds who is

quick to flee at the sight of danger mng shih gives the closer

paraphrase  he who is bent on returning alive that is

the man who will never take a risk but as sun tz knew nothing

is to be achieved in war unless you are willing to take risks

tai kung said  he who lets an advantage slip will

subsequently bring upon himself real disaster in  ad 

liu y pursued the rebel  huan hsan up the yangtsze and fought

a naval battle with him at  the island of chnghung the

loyal troops numbered only a few thousands while their opponents

were in great force but huan hsan fearing the fate which was in

store for him should he be overcome had a light boat made fast to

the side of his warjunk so that he might escape if necessary

at a moments notice the natural result was that the fighting

spirit of his soldiers was utterly quenched and when the

loyalists made an attack from windward with fireships all

striving with the utmost ardour to be first in the fray huan

hsans forces were routed had to burn all their baggage and fled

for two days and nights without stopping see  chap 

fol  chang y tells a somewhat similar story of  chao

yingchi a general of the chin state who during a battle with

the army of chu in  bc had a boat kept in readiness for him

on the river wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get

across
 a hasty temper which can be provoked by insults
i fail to see the meaning of capt calthrops which brings

insult tu mu tells us that  yao hsiang when opposed in 

ad by  huang mei  tng chiang and others shut himself

up behind his walls and refused to fight tng chiang said our

adversary is of a choleric temper and easily provoked let us make

constant sallies and break down his walls then he will grow angry

and come out once we can bring his force to battle it is doomed

to be our prey this plan was acted upon yao hsiang came out to

fight was lured on as far as  sanyuan by the enemys

pretended flight and finally attacked and slain
 a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame
this need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really

a defect in a general what sun tz condemns is rather an

exaggerated sensitiveness to slanderous reports the thinskinned

man who is stung by opprobrium however undeserved mei yaochn

truly observes though somewhat paradoxically  the seeker

after glory should be careless of public opinion
 oversolicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and

trouble
here again sun tz does not mean that the general is to be

careless of the welfare of his troops all he wishes to emphasise

is the danger of sacrificing any important military advantage to

the immediate comfort of his men this is a shortsighted policy

because in the long run the troops will suffer more from the

defeat or at best the prolongation of the war which will be

the consequence a mistaken feeling of pity will often induce

a general to relieve a beleaguered city or to reinforce a

hardpressed detachment contrary to his military instincts it

is now generally admitted that our repeated efforts to relieve

ladysmith in the south african war were so many strategical

blunders which defeated their own purpose and in the end relief

came through the very man who started out with the distinct

resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to

sentiment in favour of a part an old soldier of one of our

generals who failed most conspicuously in this war tried once i

remember to defend him to me on the ground that he was always so

good to his men by this plea had he but known it he was only

condemning him out of sun tzs mouth
 
these are the five besetting sins of a general ruinous to the conduct

of war
 
when an army is overthrown and its leader slain the cause will surely

be found among these five dangerous faults let them be a subject of

meditation


ix 



the army on the march

the contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in  

than by this heading
 
sun tz said we come now to the question of encamping the army and

observing signs of the enemy
the discussion of  as chang y points out extends from here

down to    and  from that point down to

   the rest of the chapter consists of a few

desultory remarks chiefly on the subject of discipline
pass quickly over mountains
for this use of  cf infra   see also  ch  fol 

standard edition of   shih chi ch  ad init


and keep in the neighbourhood of valleys
tu mu says that  here   the idea is not to linger among

barren uplands but to keep close to supplies of water and grass

capt calthrop translates camp in valleys heedless of the very

next sentence cf wu tz ch   abide not in natural

ovens ie  the openings of large valleys chang y

tells the following anecdote  wutu chiang was a robber

captain in the time of the later han and  ma yuan was sent to

exterminate his gang chiang having found a refuge in the hills

ma yuan made no attempt to force a battle but seized all the

favourable positions commanding supplies of water and forage

chiang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of provisions

that he was forced to make a total surrender he did not know the

advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys

 
camp in high places
not on high hills but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the

surrounding country
facing the sun
   tu mu takes this to mean facing south and chn hao

facing east cf infra   
do not climb heights in order to fight
 is here simply equivalent to  the tung tien and y lan

read 
so much for mountain warfare
after  the tung tien and y lan insert 
 
after crossing a river you should get far away from it
in order to tempt the enemy to cross after you according to

tsao kung and also says chang y in order not to be impeded

in your evolutions the tung tien reads  if the

enemy crosses a river etc but in view of the next sentence

this is almost certainly an interpolation
 
when an invading force crosses a river in its onward march do not

advance to meet it in midstream it will be best to let half the army

get across and then deliver your attack
the tung tien and y lan read  for  without change of

meaning wu tz plagiarises this passage twice overch ii ad

fin  ch v  li chan alludes to

the great victory won by han hsin over  lung ch at the  wei

river turning to the chien han shu ch  fol  verso we

find the battle described as follows the two armies were drawn

up on opposite sides of the river in the night han hsin ordered

his men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and

construct a dam a little higher up then leading half his army

across he attacked lung ch but after a time pretending to have

failed in his attempt he hastily withdrew to the other bank lung

ch was much elated by this unlookedfor success and exclaiming

i felt sure that han hsin was really a coward he pursued him

and began crossing the river in his turn han hsin now sent a

party to cut open the sandbags thus releasing a great volume of

water which swept down and prevented the greater portion of lung

chs army from getting across he then turned upon the force

which had been cut off and annihilated it lung ch himself being

amongst the slain the rest of the army on the further bank also

scattered and fled in all directions
 
if you are anxious to fight you should not go to meet the invader

near a river which he has to cross
for fear of preventing his crossing capt calthrop makes the

injunction ridiculous by omitting 
 
moor your craft higher up than the enemy and facing the sun
see supra   the repetition of these words in connection with

water is very awkward chang y has the note 

said either of troops marshalled on the riverbank

or of boats anchored in the stream itself in either case it is

essential to be higher than the enemy and facing the sun the

other commentators are not at all explicit one is much tempted

to reject their explanation of  altogether and understand it

simply as seeking safety cf  in viii   and infra

  it is true that this involves taking  in an unusual though

not i think an impossible sense of course the earlier passage

would then have to be translated in like manner
do not move upstream to meet the enemy
tu mu says as water flows downwards we must not pitch our camp

on the lower reaches of a river for fear the enemy should open

the sluices and sweep us away in a flood this is implied above

in the words  chuko wuhou has remarked that in river

warfare we must not advance against the stream which is as

much as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of

the enemy for then they would be able to take advantage of the

current and make short work of us there is also the danger

noted by other commentators that the enemy may throw poison on

the water to be carried down to us capt calthrops first version

was do not cross rivers in the face of the streama sapient

piece of advice which made one curious to know what the correct

way of crossing rivers might be he has now improved this into

do not fight when the enemy is between the army and the source of

the river
so much for river warfare
 
in crossing saltmarshes your sole concern should be to get over them

quickly without any delay
because of the lack of fresh water the poor quality of the

herbage and last but not least because they are low flat and

exposed to attack
 
if forced to fight in a saltmarsh you should have water and grass

near you and get your back to a clump of trees
li chan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous

where there are trees while tu yu says that they will serve to

protect the rear capt calthrop with a perfect genius for going

wrong says in the neighbourhood of a marsh for  the tung

tien and y lan wrongly read  and the latter also has 

instead of 
so much for operations in saltmarshes
 
in dry level country take up an easily accessible position
this is doubtless the force of  its opposite being  thus tu

mu explains it as  ground that is smooth and firm and

therefore adapted for cavalry chang y as  level

ground free from depressions and hollows he adds later on

that although sun tz is discussing flat country there will

nevertheless be slight elevations and hillocks
with rising ground to your right and on your rear

the y lan again reads  for  tu mu quotes tai kung as saying

an army should have a stream or a marsh on its left and a hill

or tumulus on its right
so that the danger may be in front and safety lie behind
wang hsi thinks that  contradicts the saying  in   and

therefore suspects a mistake in the text
so much for campaigning in flat country
 
these are the four useful branches of military knowledge
those namely concerned with  mountains  rivers 

marshes and  plains compare napoleons military maxims no


which enabled the yellow emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns
mei yaochn asks with some plausibility whether  is not a

mistake for  armies as nothing is known of huang ti having

conquered four other emperors the shih chi ch i ad init

speaks only of his victories over  yen ti and  chih yu

in the  it is mentioned that he fought seventy battles and

pacified the empire tsao kungs explanation is that the yellow

emperor was the first to institute the feudal system of vassal

princes each of whom to the number of four originally bore

the title of emperor li chan tells us that the art of war

originated under huang ti who received it from his minister 

fng hou
 
all armies prefer high ground to low
high ground says mei yaochn is not only more agreeable and

salubrious but more convenient from a military point of view low

ground is not only damp and unhealthy but also disadvantageous

for fighting the original text and the tu shu have  instead

of 
and sunny places to dark
 
if you are careful of your men
tsao kung says  make for fresh water and pasture

where you can turn out your animals to graze and the other

commentators follow him apparently taking  as   cf mencius

v  ix  where  means a cattlekeeper but here 

surely has reference to the health of the troops it is the title

of chuang tzs third chapter where it denotes moral rather than

physical wellbeing
and camp on hard ground
 must mean dry and solid as opposed to damp and marshy ground

this is to be found as a rule in high places so the commentators

explain  as practically equivalent to 
the army will be free from disease of every kind
chang y says the dryness of the climate will prevent the

outbreak of illness
and this will spell victory
 
when you come to a hill or a bank occupy the sunny side with the

slope on your right rear thus you will at once act for the benefit of

your soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground
 
when in consequence of heavy rains upcountry a river which you

wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam you must wait until it

subsides
the tung tien and y lan have a superfluous  before 
 
country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running

between
 explained by mei yaochn as 
deep natural hollows
 explained as  places enclosed on every side

by steep banks with pools of water at the bottom
confined places

 natural pens or prisons explained as 

places surrounded by precipices on three sideseasy to get into

but hard to get out of
tangled thickets
 explained as  places covered with such dense

undergrowth that spears cannot be used
quagmires
 explained as  lowlying places so heavy with

mud as to be impassible for chariots and horsemen
and crevasses
 is explained by mei yaochn as  a narrow

difficult way between beetling cliffs but tsao kung says

 which seems to denote something on a much

smaller scale tu mus note is  ground covered

with trees and rocks and intersected by numerous ravines and

pitfalls this is very vague but chia lin explains it clearly

enough as a defile or narrow pass  and chang

y takes much the same view on the whole the weight of the

commentators certainly inclines to the rendering defile but the

ordinary meaning of  a crack or fissure and the fact that 

above must be something in the nature of a defile make me think

that sun tz is here speaking of crevasses the tung tien and

y lan read  for  with the same meaning the latter also

has  after a palpable gloss
should be left with all possible speed and not approached
 
while we keep away from such places we should get the enemy to

approach them while we face them we should let the enemy have them

on his rear
 
if in the neighbourhood of your camp
the original text has  but  has been generally adopted as

yielding much better sense

there should be any hilly country
 is  according to chang y
ponds surrounded by aquatic grass hollow basins filled with reeds
the original text omits  and  so that  and  join to make a

pair ponds and basins this is plausible enough at first sight

but there are several objections to the reading   is unlikely

to have got into the text as a gloss on   it is easy to

suppose on the other hand that  and afterwards  to restore

the balance of the sentence were omitted by a copyist who jumped

to the conclusion that  and  must go together  the sense

when one comes to consider it actually requires  for it is

absurd to talk of pools and ponds as in themselves suitable places

for an ambush  li ching  a d in his  art

of war has the words  this is evidently a

reminiscence of sun tz so there can be little doubt that  stood

in the text at this early date it may be added that the tung

tien and y lan both have  and the latter also reads  for 
or woods with thick undergrowth
i read  with the y lan in preference to  given in the

original text which is accepted by the commentators without

question the text of the tu shu up to this point runs as

follows 
they must be carefully routed out and searched for these are places

where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking
the original text omits  which has been restored from the tung

tien and y lan the tu shu omits  as well making  a

substantive on  chang y has the note 

we must also be on our guard against traitors who may

lie in close covert secretly spying out our weaknesses and

overhearing our instructions fu and chien are to be taken

separately
 
when the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet he is relying on

the natural strength of his position

here begin sun tzs remarks on the reading of signs much of

which is so good that it could almost be included in a modern

manual like gen badenpowells aids to scouting
 
when he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle he is anxious for

the other side to advance
probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes

to dislodge us if he came close up to us says tu mu and

tried to force a battle he would seem to despise us and there

would be less probability of our responding to the challenge
 
if his place of encampment is easy of access he is tendering a bait
 is here the opposite of  in   the reading of the tung

tien and y lan  is pretty obviously corrupt

the original text which transposes  and  may very possibly be

right tu mu tells us that there is yet another reading


 
movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is

advancing
tsao kung explains this as felling trees to clear a passage

and chang y says every army sends out scouts to climb high

places and observe the enemy if a scout sees that the trees of a

forest are moving and shaking he may know that they are being cut

down to clear a passage for the enemys march
the appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass

means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious
whenever the meaning of a passage happens to be somewhat elusive

capt calthrop seems to consider himself justified in giving free

rein to the imagination thus though his text is here identical

with ours he renders the above broken branches and trodden

grass as of the passing of a large host must be regarded with

suspicion tu yus explanation borrowed from tsao kung is as

follows the presence of a number of screens or sheds in the

midst of thick vegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled

and fearing pursuit has constructed these hidingplaces in order

to make us suspect an ambush it appears that these screens

were hastily knotted together out of any long grass which the

retreating enemy happened to come across
 
the rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade
chang ys explanation is doubtless right when birds that are

flying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards it means

that soldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath
startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming
an example of  fou in the meaning of ambuscade may be found

in the tso chuan  th year  in the present

passage however it is to be distinguished from  just above in

that it implies onward motion on the part of the attacking force

thus li chan defines it as  and tu mu as 
 
when there is dust rising in a high column it is the sign of chariots

advancing when the dust is low but spread over a wide area it

betokens the approach of infantry
 high and sharp or rising to a peak is of course somewhat

exaggerated as applied to dust the commentators explain the

phenomenon by saying that horses and chariots being heavier than

men raise more dust and also follow one another in the same

wheeltrack whereas footsoldiers would be marching in ranks

many abreast according to chang y every army on the march must

have scouts  some way in advance who on sighting dust

raised by the enemy will gallop back and report it to the

commanderinchief cf gen badenpowell as you move along

say in a hostile country your eyes should be looking afar for

the enemy or any signs of him figures dust rising birds getting

up glitter of arms etc
when it branches out in different directions it shows that parties

have been sent to collect firewood
there is some doubt about the reading  the tung tien and

y lan have  and li chan proposes 

a few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is

encamping
chang y says in apportioning the defences for a cantonment

light horse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain

the weak and strong points all along its circumference hence the

small quantity of dust and its motion
 
humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is

about to advance
as though they stood in great fear of us says tu mu their

object is to make us contemptuous and careless after which they

will attack us chang y alludes to the story of  tien tan of

the chi state who in  bc was hardpressed in his defence of

 chimo against the yen forces led by  chi chieh in ch

 of the shih chi we read tien tan openly said my only

fear is that the yen army may cut off the noses of their chi

prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight against us

that would be the undoing of our city the other side being

informed of this speech at once acted on the suggestion

but those within the city were enraged at seeing their

fellowcountrymen thus mutilated and fearing only lest they

should fall into the enemys hands were nerved to defend

themselves more obstinately than ever once again tien tan sent

back converted spies who reported these words to the enemy what

i dread most is that the men of yen may dig up the ancestral

tombs outside the town and by inflicting this indignity on our

forefathers cause us to become fainthearted forthwith the

besiegers dug up all the graves and burned the corpses lying in

them and the inhabitants of chimo witnessing the outrage from

the citywalls wept passionately and were all impatient to go out

and fight their fury being increased tenfold tien tan knew then

that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise but instead of a

sword he himself took a mattock in his hands and ordered others

to be distributed amongst his best warriors while the ranks were

filled up with their wives and concubines he then served out all

the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill the regular

soldiers were told to keep out of sight and the walls were manned

with the old and weaker men and with women this done envoys were

despatched to the enemys camp to arrange terms of surrender

whereupon the yen army began shouting for joy tien tan also

collected  ounces of silver from the people and got the

wealthy citizens of chimo to send it to the yen general with the

prayer that when the town capitulated he would not allow their

homes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated chi chieh

in high good humour granted their prayer but his army now became

increasingly slack and careless meanwhile tien tan got together

a thousand oxen decked them with pieces of red silk painted

their bodies dragonlike with coloured stripes and fastened

sharp blades on their horns and wellgreased rushes on their

tails when night came on he lighted the ends of the rushes and

drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had pierced in

the walls backing them up with a force of  picked warriors

the animals maddened with pain dashed furiously into the enemys

camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay for their

tails acted as torches showing up the hideous pattern on their

bodies and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with

whom they came into contact in the meantime the band of  had

crept up with gags in their mouths and now threw themselves on

the enemy at the same moment a frightful din arose in the city

itself all those that remained behind making as much noise as

possible by banging drums and hammering on bronze vessels until

heaven and earth were convulsed by the uproar terrorstricken

the yen army fled in disorder hotly pursued by the men of chi

who succeeded in slaying their general chi chieh the result

of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some seventy cities

which had belonged to the chi state
violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs

that he will retreat
i follow the original text here also adopted by the tu shu

the standard text reads  on the strength of tsao

kungs commentary  which shows that his text included

the word  strong as this ground is i do not think it can

counterbalance the obvious superiority of the other reading in

point of sense  not only provides no antithesis to  but makes

the whole passage absurd for if the language of the enemy is

calculated to deceive it cannot be known as deceitful at the

time and can therefore afford no sign moreover the extra word

in  an awkward locution by the way spoils the parallelism

with 
 
when the light chariots
the same according to tu yu as the  of ii  
come out first and take up a position on the wings it is a sign that the enemy is

forming for battle
the tung tien omits 
 
peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot

tu yu defines  as  and li chan as  a treaty

confirmed by oaths and hostages wang hsi and chang y on the

other hand simply say  without reason on a frivolous

pretext as though  bore the rather unusual sense of

important capt calthrop has without consultation which is

too loose
 
when there is much running about
every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental

banner
and the soldiers fall into rank
i follow the tu shu in omitting  after  tu mu quotes the

chou li ch xxix fol  
it means that the critical moment has come
what chia lin calls  as opposed to 
 
when some are seen advancing and some retreating it is a lure
capt calthrop is hardly right in translating an advance

followed by sudden retirement it is rather a case of feigned

confusion as tu mu says 
 
when the soldiers stand leaning on their spears they are faint from

want of food
 is here probably not a synonym for  but   a weapon the

original text has  which has been corrected from the

tung tien and y lan
 
if those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves the

army is suffering from thirst
as tu mu remarks  one may know the condition of a

whole army from the behaviour of a single man the  may mean

either that they drink before drawing water for the army or before

they return to camp chang y takes the latter view the tung

tien has the faulty reading  and the y lan worse

still 

 
if the enemy sees an advantage to be gained
not necessarily booty as capt calthrop translates it the

tung tien and y lan read  etc
and makes no effort to secure it the soldiers are exhausted
 
if birds gather on any spot it is unoccupied
a useful fact to bear in mind when for instance as chn hao

says the enemy has secretly abandoned his camp
clamour by night betokens nervousness
owing to false alarms or as tu mu explains it 

fear makes men restless so they fall to shouting at night

in order to keep up their courage the tung tien inserts 

before 
 
if there is disturbance in the camp the generals authority is weak

if the banners and flags are shifted about sedition is afoot
the tung tien and y lan omit 
if the officers are angry it means that the men are weary
and therefore as capt calthrop says slow to obey tu yu

understands the sentence differently if all the officers of an

army are angry with their general it means that they are broken

with fatigue owing to the exertions which he has demanded from

them
 
when an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food
 is expanded by mei yaochn following tu mu into

 which is the sense i have given above in

the ordinary course of things the men would be fed on grain and

the horses chiefly on grass
and when the men do not hang their cookingpots

the tung tien reads  which is much the same as  and the y

lan  which is manifestly wrong
over the campfires showing that they will not return to their tents
for  the tung tien and y lan both read 
you may know that they are determined to fight to the death
for  see vii   i may quote here the illustrative passage

from the hou han shu ch  given in abbreviated form by

the pei wn yn fu the rebel  wang kuo of  liang was

besieging the town of  chntsang and  huangfu sung

who was in supreme command and  tung cho were sent out against

him the latter pressed for hasty measures but sung turned a deaf

ear to his counsel at last the rebels were utterly worn out and

began to throw down their weapons of their own accord sung was

now for advancing to the attack but cho said it is a principle

of war not to pursue desperate men and not to press a retreating

host sung answered that does not apply here what i am about

to attack is a jaded army not a retreating host with disciplined

troops i am falling on a disorganised multitude not a band of

desperate men thereupon he advanced to the attack unsupported by

his colleague and routed the enemy wang kuo being slain the

inferior reading of the tu shu for   is as follows

 the first clause strikes me as rather

shallow for sun tz and it is hard to make anything of  in

the second without the negative capt calthrop nothing daunted

set down in his first edition when they cast away their

cookingpots he now has when the cookingpots are hung up on

the wall
 
the sight of men whispering together
 is well explained by tu mu as  speaking with bated

breath
in small knots
the shuo wn rather strangely defines  by the word  but the

rh ya says  to join or contract which is undoubtedly its

primary meaning chang y is right then in explaining it here by

the word  the other commentators are very much at sea tsao

kung says  tu yu  tu mu  chia lin  mei

yaochn  wang hsi 

or speaking in subdued tones
 is said to be the same as 
points to disaffection amongst the rank and file
 is equivalent to  the subject of course being the

general understood in the original text which seems to be

followed by several commentators the whole passage stands thus

 here it would be the general who is talking

to his men not the men amongst themselves for  which is the

chief stumblingblock in the way of this reading the tu shu

gives the very plausible emendation  also read hsi and

defined by kang hsi as  to speak fast but this is

unnecessary if we keep to the standard text
 
too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his

resources
because when an army is hard pressed as tu mu says there is

always a fear of mutiny and lavish rewards are given to keep the

men in good temper
too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress
because in such case discipline becomes relaxed and unwonted

severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty
 
to begin by bluster but afterwards to take fright at the enemys

numbers shows a supreme lack of intelligence
i follow the interpretation of tsao kung 

also adopted by li chan tu mu and chang y another possible

meaning set forth by tu yu chia lin mei yaochn and wang hsi

is the general who is first tyrannical towards his men and then

in terror lest they should mutiny etc this would connect the

sentence with what went before about rewards and punishments the

tung tien and y lan read  affection instead of 
 
when envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths it is a sign

that the enemy wishes for a truce

tu mu says  if the enemy

open friendly relations by sending hostages it is a sign that

they are anxious for an armistice either because their strength

is exhausted or for some other reason but it hardly needs a sun

tz to draw such an obvious inference and although tu mu is

supported by mei yaochn and chang y i cannot think that

hostages are indicated by the word 
 
if the enemys troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for

a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off

again the situation is one that demands great vigilance and

circumspection
capt calthrop falls into a trap which often lurks in the word 

he translates when both sides eager for a fight face each

other for a considerable time neither advancing nor retiring

etc had he reflected a little he would have seen that this is

meaningless as addressed to a commander who has control over the

movements of his own troops  then does not mean that the two

armies go to meet each other but simply that the other side comes

up to us likewise with  if this were not perfectly clear of

itself mei yaochns paraphrase would make it so 

etc as tsao kung points out a manuvre of this sort may be only

a ruse to gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying

of an ambush
 
if our troops are no more in number than the enemy that is amply

sufficient
wang hsis paraphrase partly borrowed from tsao kung is

 another reading adopted by chia lin and the tu shu

is  which capt calthrop renders much too loosely

numbers are no certain mark of strength
it only means that no direct attack can be made
literally no martial advance that is to say  chng

tactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed and stratagem

resorted to instead
what we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength

keep a close watch on the enemy and obtain reinforcements

this is an obscure sentence and none of the commentators succeed

in squeezing very good sense out of it the difficulty lies

chiefly in the words  which have been taken in every possible

way i follow li chan who appears to offer the simplest

explanation  only the side that gets more men will

win tsao kungs note concise as usual to the verge of

incomprehensibility is  fortunately we have chang y to

expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself



when the numbers are even and no favourable opening

presents itself although we may not be strong enough to deliver

a sustained attack we can find additional recruits amongst our

sutlers and campfollowers and then concentrating our forces

and keeping a close watch on the enemy contrive to snatch the

victory but we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us

he then quotes from wei liao tz ch  

the nominal strength of mercenary troops may be  but

their real value will be not more than half that figure

according to this interpretation  means to get recruits not

from outside but from the tagrag and bobtail which follows in

the wake of a large army this does not sound a very soldierly

suggestion and i feel convinced that it is not what sun tz

meant chia lin on the other hand takes the words in a different

sense altogether namely to conquer the enemy cf i   but

in that case they could hardly be followed by  better than

this would be the rendering to make isolated captures as

opposed to  a general attack
 
he who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is

sure to be captured by them
the force of  is not easy to appreciate chn hao says 

thus referring  to the second verb he continues quoting

from the tso chuan  if bees and

scorpions carry poison how much more will a hostile state 

xxii  even a puny opponent then should not be treated with

contempt
 
if soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you they

will not prove submissive and unless submissive they will be

practically useless if when the soldiers have become attached to

you punishments are not enforced they will still be useless
this is wrongly translated by capt calthrop if the troops know

the general but are not affected by his punishments they are

useless
 
therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with

humanity but kept under control by means of iron discipline
 and  according to tsao kung are here equivalent to  and

 respectively compare our two uses of the word civil  yen

tz  bc  said of  ssma jangch 

his civil virtues endeared him to the people his martial prowess

kept his enemies in awe cf wu tz ch  init 

the ideal commander unites culture with a

warlike temper the profession of arms requires a combination

of hardness and tenderness again i must find fault with capt

calthrops translation by humane treatment we obtain obedience

authority brings uniformity
this is a certain road to victory
 
if in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced the army

will be welldisciplined if not its discipline will be bad
the tung tien and y lan read 
 
if a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his

orders being obeyed
the original text has   is certainly awkward without

 but on the other hand it is clear that tu mu accepted the

tung tien text which is identical with ours he says a

general ought in time of peace to show kindly confidence in his

men and also make his authority respected so that when they

come to face the enemy orders may be executed and discipline

maintained because they all trust and look up to him what sun

tz has said in   however would lead one rather to expect

something like this if a general is always confident that his

orders will be carried out etc hence i am tempted to think that

he may have written  but this is perhaps too conjectural
the gain will be mutual
chang y says  the general has

confidence in the men under his command and the men are docile

having confidence in him thus the gain is mutual he quotes a

pregnant sentence from wei liao tz ch  

the art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders

and not to be swayed by petty doubts vacillation and fussiness

are the surest means of sapping the confidence of an army capt

calthrop winds up the chapter with a final mistranslation of a

more than usually heinous description orders are always obeyed

if general and soldiers are in sympathy besides inventing the

latter half of the sentence he has managed to invert protasis and

apodosis


x 



terrain

only about a third of the chapter comprising   deals with

 the subject being more fully treated in ch xi the six

calamities are discussed in   and the rest of the chapter

is again a mere string of desultory remarks though not less

interesting perhaps on that account
 
sun tz said we may distinguish six kinds of terrain to wit

 accessible ground
mei yaochn says  plentifully provided with roads and

means of communication
 entangling ground
the same commentator says  netlike country

venturing into which you become entangled
 temporising ground
tu yu explains  as  this meaning is still retained in modern

phrases such as   stave off delay i do not know why

capt calthrop calls  suspended ground unless he is

confusing it with 
 narrow passes  precipitous heights
the root idea in  is narrowness in  steepness
 positions at a great distance from the enemy
it is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this

classification a strange lack of logical perception is shown in

the chinamans unquestioning acceptance of glaring crossdivisions

such as the above

 
ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called

accessible
generally speaking  level country is meant cf ix   
 
with regard to ground of this nature
the tung tien reads 
be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots
see ix   the tung tien reads 
and carefully guard your line of supplies
a curious use of  as a verb if our text is right the general

meaning is doubtless as tu yu says  not to allow

the enemy to cut your communications tu mu who was not a

soldier and can hardly have had any practical experience of

fighting goes more into detail and speaks of protecting the line

of communications by a wall  or enclosing it by embankments on

each side  in view of napoleons dictum the secret of

war lies in the communications we could wish that sun tz

had done more than skirt the edge of this important subject here

and in i   vii   col henderson says the line of

supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an army as

the heart to the life of a human being just as the duellist who

finds his adversarys point menacing him with certain death and

his own guard astray is compelled to conform to his adversarys

movements and to content himself with warding off his thrusts so

the commander whose communications are suddenly threatened finds

himself in a false position and he will be fortunate if he has

not to change all his plans to split up his force into more or

less isolated detachments and to fight with inferior numbers on

ground which he has not had time to prepare and where defeat will

not be an ordinary failure but will entail the ruin or the

surrender of his whole army
then you will be able to fight with advantage
omitted by capt calthrop

 
ground which can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called

entangling
capt calthrop is wrong in translating  retreat from it
 
from a position of this sort if the enemy is unprepared you may

sally forth and defeat him but if the enemy is prepared for your

coming and you fail to defeat him then return being impossible

disaster will ensue
 an example of litotes is paraphrased by mei yaochn as

 you will receive a check
 
when the position is such that neither side will gain by making the

first move it is called temporising ground
 each side finds it inconvenient to move and the

situation remains at a deadlock tu yu
 
in a position of this sort even though the enemy should offer us an

attractive bait
tu yu says  turning their backs on us and pretending to

flee but this is only one of the lures which might induce us to

quit our position here again  is used as a verb but this time

in a different sense to hold out an advantage to
it will be advisable not to stir forth but rather to retreat

thus enticing the enemy in his turn then when part of

his army has come out we may deliver our attack with

advantage
mei yaochn paraphrases the passage in a curious jingle the scheme

of rhymes being abcbdd 

 
with regard to narrow passes if you can occupy them first
capt calthrop says defiles make haste to occupy but this is

a conditional clause answering to  in the next paragraph
let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy
because then as tu yu observes  the

initiative will lie with us and by making sudden and unexpected

attacks we shall have the enemy at our mercy the commentators

make a great pother about the precise meaning of  which to the

foreign reader seems to present no difficulty whatever
 
should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass do not go after

him if the pass is fully garrisoned but only if it is weakly

garrisoned
 
with regard to precipitous heights if you are beforehand with your

adversary you should occupy the raised and sunny spots and there

wait for him to come up
tsao kung says  the particular advantage of

securing heights and defiles is that your actions cannot then

be dictated by the enemy for the enunciation of the grand

principle alluded to see vi   chang y tells the following

anecdote of  pei hsingchien ad  who was sent

on a punitive expedition against the turkic tribes at nightfall

he pitched his camp as usual and it had already been completely

fortified by wall and ditch when suddenly he gave orders that the

army should shift its quarters to a hill near by this was highly

displeasing to his officers who protested loudly against the

extra fatigue which it would entail on the men pei hsingchien

however paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp

moved as quickly as possible the same night a terrific storm

came on which flooded their former place of encampment to the

depth of over twelve feet the recalcitrant officers were amazed

at the sight and owned that they had been in the wrong how did

you know what was going to happen they asked pei hsingchien

replied from this time forward be content to obey orders without

asking unnecessary questions see chiu tang shu ch  fol

 ro and hsin tang shu ch  fol  vo from this

it may be seen chang y continues that high and sunny places

are advantageous not only for fighting but also because they are

immune from disastrous floods
 
if the enemy has occupied them before you do not follow him but

retreat and try to entice him away
the turningpoint of  li shihmins campaign in  ad

against the two rebels  tou chient king of  hsia and

 wang shihchung prince of  chng was his seizure of the

heights of  wulao in spite of which tou chient persisted in

his attempt to relieve his ally in loyang was defeated and taken

prisoner see chiu tang shu ch  fol  vo and also ch


 
if you are situated at a great distance from the enemy and the

strength of the two armies is equal
the tung tien reads 
it is not easy to provoke a battle
tsao kung says that  means  challenging the enemy but

the enemy being far away that plainly involves as tu yu says

 going to meet him the point of course is that we must not

think of undertaking a long and wearisome march at the end of

which  we should be exhausted and our adversary fresh

and keen
and fighting will be to your disadvantage
 
these six are the principles connected with earth
or perhaps the principles relating to ground see however i

 
the general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to

study them
capt calthrop omits  out of the foregoing six  it will

be noticed that nos  and  have really no reference to the

configuration of the country and that only  and  can be said to

convey any definite geographical idea

 
now an army is exposed to six several calamities not arising from

natural causes
the tu shu reads 
but from faults for which the general is responsible these are 

flight  insubordination  collapse  ruin 

disorganisation  rout
i take exception to capt calthrops rendering of  and  as

distress and disorganisation respectively
 
other conditions being equal if one force is hurled against another

ten times its size the result will be the flight of the former
cf iii   the generals fault here is that of  not

calculating the enemys strength it is obvious that  cannot

have the same force as in   where it was equivalent to  i

should not be inclined however to limit it with chang y to

 the wisdom and valour of the general and the

sharpness of the weapons as li chan very justly remarks

 given a decided advantage in position

or the help of some stratagem such as a flank attack or an

ambuscade it would be quite possible to fight in the ratio of

one to ten
 
when the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak

the result is insubordination
 laxitythe metaphor being taken from an unstrung bow capt

calthrops relaxation is not good on account of its ambiguity

tu mu cites the unhappy case of  tien pu hsin tang shu

ch  who was sent to  wei in  ad with orders to lead an

army against  wang tingtsou but the whole time he was in

command his soldiers treated him with the utmost contempt and

openly flouted his authority by riding about the camp on donkeys

several thousands at a time tien pu was powerless to put a stop

to this conduct and when after some months had passed he made an

attempt to engage the enemy his troops turned tail and dispersed

in every direction after that the unfortunate man committed

suicide by cutting his throat
when the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak the

result is collapse
tsao kung says  the officers are energetic and

want to press on the common soldiers are feeble and suddenly

collapse note that  is to be taken literally of physical

weakness whereas in the former clause it is figurative li chan

makes  equivalent to  and tu mu explains it as 

stumbling into a deathtrap
 
when the higher officers
 according to tsao kung are the  generals of inferior

rank but li chan chn hao and wang hsi take the term as

simply convertible with  or 
are angry and insubordinate and on meeting the enemy give battle

on their own account from a feeling of resentment before the

commanderinchief can tell whether or no he is in a position to

fight the result is ruin
tsao kung makes  understood the subject of  which seems

rather farfetched wang hsis note is 

this means the general is angry without just

cause and at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his

subordinate officers thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings

an avalanche of ruin upon his head he takes  therefore

in the sense of  but i think that chn hao is right in his

paraphrase  they dont care if it be possible or no my

interpretation of the whole passage is that of mei yaochn and

chang y tu mu gives a long extract from the tso chuan 

xii  showing how the great battle of  pi  bc was lost

for the  chin state through the contumacy of  hsien hu and

the resentful spite of  wei i and  chao chan chang y also

alludes to the mutinous conduct of  luan yen ibid 

xiv 

 
when the general is weak and without authority when his orders are

not clear and distinct
wei liao tz ch  says  if

the commander gives his orders with decision the soldiers will not

wait to hear them twice if his moves are made without vacillation

the soldiers will not be in two minds about doing their duty

general badenpowell says italicising the words the secret of

getting successful work out of your trained men lies in one

nutshellin the clearness of the instructions they receive

assuming that clear instructions beget confidence this is very much

what wei liao tz loc cit goes on to say 

cf also wu tz ch   the

most fatal defect in a military leader is diffidence the worst

calamities that befall an army arise from hesitation
when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men
 neither officers nor men have any regular routine

tu mu
and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner the result is

utter disorganisation
 
when a general unable to estimate the enemys strength allows an

inferior force to engage a larger one or hurls a weak detachment

against a powerful one and neglects to place picked soldiers in the

front rank the result must be a rout
chang y paraphrases the latter part of the sentence 

and continues 

whenever there is fighting to be done the keenest spirits

should be appointed to serve in the front ranks both in order to

strengthen the resolution of our own men and to demoralise the

enemy cf the primi ordines of caesar de bello gallico v

  et al there seems little to distinguish  from  in 

 except that  is a more forcible word
 
these are six ways of courting defeat
chn hao makes them out to be   neglect to estimate

the enemys strength   want of authority 

 defective training   unjustifiable anger

  nonobservance of discipline   failure

to use picked men
which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a

responsible post
see supra  
 
the natural formation of the country is the soldiers best ally
chia lins text has the reading  for  chn hao says

 the advantages of weather and season are not equal to those

connected with ground
but a power of estimating the adversary
the insertion of a but is necessary to show the connection of

thought here a general should always utilise but never rely

wholly on natural advantages of terrain
of controlling the forces of victory
 is one of those condensed expressions which mean so much in

chinese and so little in an english translation what it seems to

imply is complete mastery of the situation from the beginning
and of shrewdly calculating difficulties dangers and distances
the tung tien and y lan read  i am decidedly

puzzled by capt calthrops translation an eye for steepness

command and distances where did he find the word which i have

put in italics

constitutes the test of a great general
a somewhat free translation of  as chang y remarks these are

 the essentials of soldiering ground being only a helpful

accessory
 
he who knows these things and in fighting puts his knowledge into

practice will win his battles he who knows them not nor practises

them will surely be defeated
 
if fighting is sure to result in victory then you must fight even

though the ruler forbid it if fighting will not result in victory

then you must not fight even at the rulers bidding
cf viii   fin huang shihkung of the chin dynasty who

is said to have been the patron of  chang liang and to have

written the  has these words attributed to him

 the responsibility of setting an

army in motion must devolve on the general alone if advance and

retreat are controlled from the palace brilliant results will

hardly be achieved hence the godlike ruler and the enlightened

monarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their

countrys cause lit kneel down to push the chariot wheel

this means that  in matters lying outside the

zenana the decision of the military commander must be absolute

chang y also quotes the saying  decrees of the

son of heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp napoleon who

has been accused of allowing his generals too little independence

of action speaks in the same sense un gnral en chef nest pas

 couvert de ses fautes  la guerre par un ordre de son souverain

ou du ministre quand celui qui le donne est loign du champ

dopration et quil connat mal ou ne connat pas du tout le

dernier tat des choses

 
the general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without

fearing disgrace
it was wellington i think who said that the hardest thing of all

for a soldier is to retreat
whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for

his sovereign
 which is omitted by the tu shu is said by chn hao to be

equivalent to  if it had to be separately translated it would

be something like our word accrue
is the jewel of the kingdom
a noble presentment in few words of the chinese happy warrior

such a man says ho shih  even if he had to suffer

punishment would not regret his conduct
 
regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into

the deepest valleys look on them as your own beloved sons and they

will stand by you even unto death
cf i   in this connection tu mu draws for us an engaging

picture of the famous general wu chi from whose treatise on war

i have frequently had occasion to quote he wore the same clothes

and ate the same food as the meanest of his soldiers refused to

have either a horse to ride or a mat to sleep on carried his own

surplus rations wrapped in a parcel and shared every hardship

with his men one of his soldiers was suffering from an abscess

and wu chi himself sucked out the virus the soldiers mother

hearing this began wailing and lamenting somebody asked her

saying why do you cry your son is only a common soldier and

yet the commanderinchief himself has sucked the poison from his

sore the woman replied many years ago lord wu performed a

similar service for my husband who never left him afterwards and

finally met his death at the hands of the enemy and now that he

has done the same for my son he too will fall fighting i know not

where li chan mentions  the viscount of chu who invaded

the small state of  hsiao during the winter  the duke of

shn said to him many of the soldiers are suffering severely

from the cold so he made a round of the whole army comforting

and encouraging the men and straightway they felt as if they

were clothed in garments lined with floss silk tso chuan 

xii  chang y alludes to the same passage saying 
 
if however you are indulgent but unable to make your authority

felt kindhearted but unable to enforce your commands and

incapable moreover of quelling disorder
capt calthrop has got these three clauses quite wrong the last

he translates overindulgence may produce disorder
then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children they are

useless for any practical purpose
cf ix   we read in the  pt   injury comes

out of kindness li ching once said that if you could make your

soldiers afraid of you they would not be afraid of the enemy tu

mu recalls an instance of stern military discipline which occurred

in  ad when  l mng was occupying the town of 

chiangling he had given stringent orders to his army not to

molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by force

nevertheless a certain officer serving under his banner who

happened to be a fellowtownsman ventured to appropriate a bamboo

hat  belonging to one of the people in order to wear it over

his regulation helmet as a protection against the rain l mng

considered that the fact of his being also a native of  junan

should not be allowed to palliate a clear breach of discipline

and accordingly he ordered his summary execution the tears

rolling down his face however as he did so this act of severity

filled the army with wholesome awe and from that time forth even

articles dropped in the highway were not picked up san kuo

chih ch  f  ro  vo
 
if we know that our own men are in a condition to attack but are

unaware that the enemy is not open to attack we have gone only

halfway towards victory
that is as tsao kung says the issue in this case is uncertain

 
if we know that the enemy is open to attack but are unaware that our

own men are not in a condition to attack we have gone only halfway

towards victory
cf iii   
 
if we know that the enemy is open to attack and also know that our

men are in a condition to attack but are unaware that the nature of

the ground makes fighting impracticable we have still gone only

halfway towards victory
i may take this opportunity of pointing out the rather nice

distinction in meaning between  and  the latter is simply to

attack without any further implication whereas  is a stronger

word which in nine cases out of ten means to attack with

expectation of victory to fall upon as we should say or even

to crush on the other hand  is not quite synonymous with 

which is mostly used of operations on a larger scale as of one

state making war on another often with the added idea of

invasion  finally has special reference to the subjugation of

rebels see mencius vii  ii 
 
hence the experienced soldier once in motion is never bewildered

once he has broken camp he is never at a loss
the reason being according to tu mu that he has taken his

measures so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand he does

not move recklessly says chang y so that when he does move

he makes no mistakes another reading substitutes  for  and

 for  the latter variant only is adopted by the tung tien

and y lan note that  here means at the end of his mental

resources
 
hence the saying if you know the enemy and know yourself your

victory will not stand in doubt

capt calthrop makes the saying end here which cannot be justified
if you know heaven and know earth
 and  are transposed for the sake of the jingle between  and

 the original text however has  and the correction

has been made from the tung tien
you may make your victory complete
as opposed to  above the original text has  the

corruption being perhaps due to the occurrence of  in the

preceding sentence here however  would not be synonymous

with  but equivalent to  inexhaustible beyond

the nine situations

li chan is not quite right in calling these  as we shall

see some of them are highly disadvantageous from the military

point of view wang hsi more correctly says 

there are nine military situations good and bad one would like

to distinguish the  from the six  of chap x by saying that

the latter refer to the natural formation or geographical features

of the country while the  have more to do with the condition

of the army being  situations as opposed to grounds but

it is soon found impossible to carry out the distinction both are

crossdivisions for among the  we have temporising ground

side by side with narrow passes while in the present chapter

there is even greater confusion
 
sun tz said the art of war recognises nine varieties of ground 

dispersive ground  facile ground  contentious ground  open

ground  ground of intersecting highways  serious ground 

difficult ground  hemmedin ground  desperate ground
 
when a chieftain is fighting in his own territory it is dispersive

ground
so called because the soldiers being near to their homes and

anxious to see their wives and children are likely to seize the

opportunity afforded by a battle and scatter in every direction

in their advance observes tu mu they will lack the valour of

desperation and when they retreat they will find harbours of

refuge the  which appears in the tu shu seems to have been

accidentally omitted in my edition of the standard text

 
when he has penetrated into hostile territory but to no great

distance it is facile ground
li chan and ho shih say  because of the facility for

retreating and the other commentators give similar explanations

tu mu remarks  when your army has

crossed the border you should burn your boats and bridges in

order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering

after home i do not think that disturbing ground capt

calthrops rendering of  has anything to justify it if an

idiomatic translation is out of the question one should at least

attempt to be literal
 
ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side

is contentious ground
i must apologise for using this word in a sense not known to the

dictionary ie to be contended fortu mus  tsao kung

says  ground on which the few and the weak can

defeat the many and the strong such as  the neck of a pass

instanced by li chan thus thermopylae was a  because the

possession of it even for a few days only meant holding the

entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time

cf wu tz ch v ad init  for those who have

to fight in the ratio of one to ten there is nothing better

than a narrow pass when  l kuang was returning from his

triumphant expedition to turkestan in  ad and had got as far

as  iho laden with spoils  liang hsi administrator of

 liangchou taking advantage of the death of fu chien king

of chin plotted against him and was for barring his way into the

province  yang han governor of  kaochang counselled

him saying l kuang is fresh from his victories in the west

and his soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome if we oppose him in

the shifting sands of the desert we shall be no match for him

and we must therefore try a different plan let us hasten to

occupy the defile at the mouth of the  kaowu pass thus

cutting him off from supplies of water and when his troops are

prostrated with thirst we can dictate our own terms without

moving or if you think that the pass i mention is too far off

we could make a stand against him at the  iwu pass which is

nearer the cunning and resource of  tzfang himself ie

 would be expended in vain against the enormous strength of

these two positions liang hsi refusing to act on this advice

was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader see  ch 

fol  ro and  ch  fol 
 
ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground
this is only a makeshift translation of  which according to

tsao kung stands for  ground covered with a network of

roads like a chessboard another interpretation suggested by

ho shih is  ground on which intercommunication is easy in

either case it must evidently be  flat country and

therefore  cannot be blocked cf  x  
 
ground which forms the key to three contiguous states
 our country adjoining the enemys and a third

country conterminous with both tsao kung mng shih instances

the small principality of  chng which was bounded on the

northeast by  chi on the west by  chin and on the south by

 chu
so that he who occupies it first has most of the empire at his command
 of course stands for the loose confederacy of states into

which china was divided under the chou dynasty the belligerent

who holds this dominating position can constrain most of them to

become his allies see infra    appears at first sight to

be the masses or population of the empire but it is more

probably as tu yu says 
is ground of intersecting highways
capt calthrops pathridden ground might stand well enough for

 above but it does not bring out the force of  which

clearly denotes the central position where important highways meet

 
when an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country

leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear
after  the tung tien intercalates the gloss 
it is serious ground
wang hsi explains the name by saying that  when an

army has reached such a point its situation is serious li

chan instances  the victorious march of  yo i into the

capital of chi in  bc and  the attack on chu six years

later by the chin general  po chi
 
mountain forests
or simply forests i follow the tu shu in omitting the 

before  given in the standard text which is not only otiose

but spoils the rhythm of the sentence
rugged steeps marshes and fensall country that is hard to traverse

this is difficult ground
 pi to be distinguished from  i is defined by kang

hsi after the shuo wn as  to destroy hence chia lin

explains  as ground  that has been ruined by water

passing over it and tu yu simply as  swampy ground but

chn hao says that the word is specially applied to deep

hollowswhat chuko liang he tells us used to designate by the

expressive term  earthhells compare the  of ix  
 
ground which is reached through narrow gorges and from which we can

only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy

would suffice to crush a large body of our men this is hemmedin

ground
 
ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting

without delay is desperate ground

the situation as pictured by tsao kung is very similar to the

 except that here escape is no longer possible 

a lofty mountain in front a large river behind

advance impossible retreat blocked chn hao says 

to be on desperate ground is like sitting in a

leaking boat or crouching in a burning house tu mu quotes

from li ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus

entrapped suppose an army invading hostile territory without the

aid of local guidesit falls into a fatal snare and is at the

enemys mercy a ravine on the left a mountain on the right a

pathway so perilous that the horses have to be roped together

and the chariots carried in slings no passage open in front

retreat cut off behind no choice but to proceed in single

file  then before there is time to range our

soldiers in order of battle the enemy in overwhelming strength

suddenly appears on the scene advancing we can nowhere take a

breathingspace retreating we have no haven of refuge we seek a

pitched battle but in vain yet standing on the defensive none

of us has a moments respite if we simply maintain our ground

whole days and months will crawl by the moment we make a move we

have to sustain the enemys attacks on front and rear the country

is wild destitute of water and plants the army is lacking in the

necessaries of life the horses are jaded and the men wornout

all the resources of strength and skill unavailing the pass so

narrow that a single man defending it can check the onset of ten

thousand all means of offence in the hands of the enemy all

points of vantage already forfeited by ourselvesin this terrible

plight even though we had the most valiant soldiers and the

keenest of weapons how could they be employed with the slightest

effect students of greek history may be reminded of the awful

close to the sicilian expedition and the agony of the athenians

under nicias and demosthenes see thucydides vii  sqq
 
on dispersive ground therefore fight not on facile ground halt

not on contentious ground attack not
but rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the

advantageous position first so tsao kung li chan and others

however suppose the meaning to be that the enemy has already

forestalled us so that it would be sheer madness to attack in

the  when the king of wu inquires what should be done in

this case sun tz replies the rule with regard to contentious

ground is that those in possession have the advantage over the

other side if a position of this kind is secured first by the

enemy beware of attacking him lure him away by pretending to

fleeshow your banners and sound your drumsmake a dash for other

places that he cannot afford to losetrail brushwood and raise a

dustconfound his ears and eyesdetach a body of your best troops

and place it secretly in ambuscade then your opponent will sally

forth to the rescue
 
on open ground do not try to block the enemys way
because the attempt would be futile and would expose the blocking

force itself to serious risks there are two interpretations of

 i follow that of chang y  the other

is indicated in tsao kungs brief note  draw closer

togetherie see that a portion of your own army is not cut

off wang hsi points out that  is only another name for the

 accessible ground of x   and says that the advice here

given is simply a variation of  keep a sharp eye on the line

of supplies be careful that your communications are not cut the

tung tien reads 
on ground of intersecting highways join hands with your

allies
or perhaps form alliances with neighbouring states thus tsao

kung has  capt calthrops cultivate intercourse is

much too timid and vague the original text reads 
 
on serious ground gather in plunder
on this li chan has the following delicious note

 when

an army penetrates far into the enemys country care must be

taken not to alienate the people by unjust treatment follow

the example of the han emperor kao tsu whose march into chin

territory was marked by no violation of women or looting of

valuables nota bene this was in  bc and may well cause

us to blush for the christian armies that entered peking in 

ad thus he won the hearts of all in the present passage then

i think that the true reading must be not  plunder but 

do not plunder alas i fear that in this instance the worthy

commentators feelings outran his judgment tu mu at least

has no such illusions he says when encamped on serious

ground there being no inducement as yet to advance further

and no possibility of retreat one ought to take measures for a

protracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides

and keep a close watch on the enemy cf also ii   
in difficult ground keep steadily on the march
or in the words of viii   do not encamp
 
on hemmedin ground resort to stratagem
tsao kung says  try the effect of some unusual artifice

and tu yu amplifies this by saying  in

such a position some scheme must be devised which will suit the

circumstances and if we can succeed in deluding the enemy the

peril may be escaped this is exactly what happened on the famous

occasion when hannibal was hemmed in among the mountains on

the road to casilinum and to all appearances entrapped by the

dictator fabius the stratagem which hannibal devised to baffle

his foes was remarkably like that which tien tan had also

employed with success exactly  years before see ix  

note when night came on bundles of twigs were fastened to the

horns of some  oxen and set on fire the terrified animals

being then quickly driven along the mountain side towards the

passes which were beset by the enemy the strange spectacle of

these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and discomfited the romans

that they withdrew from their position and hannibals army passed

safely through the defile see polybius iii   livy xxii

 
on desperate ground fight
for as chia lin remarks  if you fight with all

your might there is a chance of life whereas death is certain if

you cling to your corner
 
those who were called skilful leaders of old
 is omitted in the tu shu text
knew how to drive a wedge between the enemys front and rear
more literally cause the front and rear to lose touch with each

other

to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions to

hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad
i doubt if  can mean officers and men as capt calthrop

translates this is wanted for 
the officers from rallying their men
the reading  derived from the y lan must be considered very

doubtful the original text has  and the tu shu 
 
when the enemys men were scattered they prevented them from

concentrating
capt calthrop translates  they scattered the enemy which

cannot be right
even when their forces were united they managed to keep them in

disorder
mei yaochns note makes the sense plain 
 all these clauses of course down to  are dependent

on  in  
 
when it was to their advantage they made a forward move when

otherwise they stopped still
mei yaochn connects this with the foregoing

 having succeeded in thus

dislocating the enemy they would push forward in order to secure any

advantage to be gained if there was no advantage to be gained they

would remain where they were
 
if asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array

and on the point of marching to the attack
 is like  introducing a supposed question
i should say begin by seizing something which your opponent holds

dear then he will be amenable to your will

opinions differ as to what sun tz had in mind tsao kung thinks

it is  some strategical advantage on which the enemy is

depending tu mu says 

the three things which an enemy is anxious to do and on

the accomplishment of which his success depends are  to

capture our favourable positions  to ravage our cultivated

land  to guard his own communications our object then must

be to thwart his plans in these three directions and thus render

him helpless cf iii   but this exegesis unduly strains the

meaning of  and  and i agree with chn hao who says that

 does not refer only to strategical advantages but is any

person or thing that may happen to be of importance to the enemy

by boldly seizing the initiative in this way you at once throw

the other side on the defensive
 
rapidity is the essence of war
 means the conditions of war not as capt calthrop says

the spirit of the troops according to tu mu 

this is a summary of leading principles in warfare and he adds

 these are the profoundest truths of military

science and the chief business of the general the following

anecdotes told by ho shih show the importance attached to speed

by two of chinas greatest generals in  ad  mng ta

governor of  hsinchng under the wei emperor wn ti was

meditating defection to the house of shu and had entered into

correspondence with chuko liang prime minister of that state

the wei general ssma i was then military governor of  wan and

getting wind of mng tas treachery he at once set off with an

army to anticipate his revolt having previously cajoled him by a

specious message of friendly import ssmas officers came to him

and said if mng ta has leagued himself with wu and shu the

matter should be thoroughly investigated before we make a move

ssma i replied mng ta is an unprincipled man and we ought to

go and punish him at once while he is still wavering and before

he has thrown off the mask then by a series of forced marches

he brought his army under the walls of hsinchng within the

space of eight days now mng ta had previously said in a letter

to chuko liang wan is  li from here when the news of

my revolt reaches ssma i he will at once inform his imperial

master but it will be a whole month before any steps can be

taken and by that time my city will be well fortified besides

ssma i is sure not to come himself and the generals that will

be sent against us are not worth troubling about the next

letter however was filled with consternation though only eight

days have passed since i threw off my allegiance an army is

already at the citygates what miraculous rapidity is this a

fortnight later hsinchng had fallen and mng ta had lost his

head see chin shu ch  f  in  ad li ching was

sent from  kueichou in sschuan to reduce the successful

rebel  hsiao hsien who had set up as emperor at the modern

 chingchou fu in hupeh it was autumn and the yangtsze being

then in flood hsiao hsien never dreamt that his adversary would

venture to come down through the gorges and consequently made no

preparations but li ching embarked his army without loss of time

and was just about to start when the other generals implored him

to postpone his departure until the river was in a less dangerous

state for navigation li ching replied to the soldier

overwhelming speed is of paramount importance and he must never

miss opportunities now is the time to strike before hsiao hsien

even knows that we have got an army together if we seize the

present moment when the river is in flood we shall appear before

his capital with startling suddenness like the thunder which is

heard before you have time to stop your ears against it see

vii   note this is the great principle in war even if he

gets to know of our approach he will have to levy his soldiers in

such a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us thus the full

fruits of victory will be ours all came about as he predicted

and hsiao hsien was obliged to surrender nobly stipulating that

his people should be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of

death see hsin tang shu ch  f  vo
take advantage of the enemys unreadiness make your

way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots
 
the following are the principles to be observed by an invading force

the further you penetrate into a country the greater will be the

solidarity of your troops and thus the defenders will not prevail

against you
 
make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food
cf supra   li chan does not venture on a note here
 
carefully study the wellbeing of your men

 according to wang hsi means  pet them humour

them give them plenty of food and drink and look after them

generally
and do not overtax them concentrate your energy and hoard your

strength
tu mu explains these words in a rhyming couplet 

and chn recalls the line of action adopted in  bc by the

famous general  wang chien whose military genius largely

contributed to the success of the first emperor he had invaded

the chu state where a universal levy was made to oppose him

but being doubtful of the temper of his troops he declined all

invitations to fight and remained strictly on the defensive in

vain did the chu general try to force a battle day after day

wang chien kept inside his walls and would not come out but

devoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection and

confidence of his men he took care that they should be well fed

sharing his own meals with them provided facilities for bathing

and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them

into a loyal and homogeneous body after some time had elapsed

he told off certain persons to find out how the men were amusing

themselves the answer was that they were contending with one

another in putting the weight and longjumping  when

wang chien heard that they were engaged in these athletic

pursuits he knew that their spirits had been strung up to the

required pitch and that they were now ready for fighting by this

time the chu army after repeating their challenge again and

again had marched away eastwards in disgust the chin general

immediately broke up his camp and followed them and in the

battle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter shortly

afterwards the whole of chu was conquered by chin and the king

 fuchu led into captivity see shih chi ch  f  ro

it should be noted that  being a taboo character under the chin

dynasty the name figures as  throughout
keep your army continually on the move
in order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are it

has struck me however that the true reading might be not 

but  link your army together cf supra   

which would be more in keeping with  capt calthrop cuts

the gordian knot by omitting the words altogether
and devise unfathomable plans
chang ys paraphrase is 

 
throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape and they

will prefer death to flight
cf nicias speech to the athenians      

         

       etc thuc

vii  vii
if they will face death there is nothing they may not achieve
 by itself constitutes the protasis and  is the interrogative

  capt calthrop makes the protasis end with  if there be

no alternative but death but i do not see how this is to be got

out of the chinese chang y gives a clear paraphrase 

and quotes his favourite wei liao tz ch 

 if one man were to run

amok with a sword in the marketplace and everybody else tried to

get out of his way i should not allow that this man alone had

courage and that all the rest were contemptible cowards the truth

is that a desperado and a man who sets some value on his life do

not meet on even terms
officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength
 appears to stand for the more usual  chang y says

 if they are in an awkward place together they

will surely exert their united strength to get out of it
 
soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear if there is

no place of refuge they will stand firm if they are in the heart of

a hostile country they will show a stubborn front
capt calthrop weakly says there is unity as though the text

were  as in   but  introduces quite a new ideathat of

tenacitywhich tsao kung tries to explain by the word  to

bind fast
if there is no help for it they will fight hard

 
thus without waiting to be marshalled the soldiers will be

constantly on the qui vive
tu mu says  capt calthrop wrongly translates 

without warnings
without waiting to be asked they will do your will
literally without asking you will get chang ys paraphrase

is 
without restrictions they will be faithful
chang y says 
without giving orders they can be trusted
this last clause is very similar in sense to the one preceding

except that  indicates the soldiers attachment to their leader

and  the leaders attitude towards them i rather doubt if

 can mean they will have confidence in their leader as the

commentary seems to indicate that way the sense is not nearly

so good on the other hand it is just possible that here as in

viii   and infra    may   without orders they

will carry out their leaders plans the whole of this

paragraph of course has reference to desperate ground
 
prohibit the taking of omens and do away with superstitious doubts
 is amplified by tsao kung into  and  into 

cf the ssma fa ch  
then until death itself comes no calamity need be feared
the superstitious bound in to saucy doubts and fears

degenerate into cowards and die many times before their deaths

tu mu quotes huang shihkung 

spells and incantations should be strictly forbidden and no

officer allowed to inquire by divination into the fortunes of an

army for fear the soldiers minds should be seriously perturbed

the meaning is he continues that if all doubts and scruples

are discarded your men will never falter in their resolution

until they die the reading of the standard text is  there

will be no refuge which does not fit in well here i therefore

prefer to adopt the variant  which evidently stood in li

chans text
 
if our soldiers are not overburdened with money it is not because

they have a distaste for riches if their lives are not unduly long

it is not because they are disinclined to longevity
chang y has the best note on this passage

 wealth and long life are things for

which all men have a natural inclination hence if they burn or

fling away valuables and sacrifice their own lives it is not

that they dislike them but simply that they have no choice sun

tz is slyly insinuating that as soldiers are but human it is

for the general to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow

rich are not thrown in their way capt calthrop mistaking  for

the adjective has not because money is a bad thing  not

because long life is evil
 
on the day they are ordered out to battle your soldiers may weep
the word in the chinese is  snivel this is taken to indicate

more genuine grief than tears alone
those sitting up bedewing their garments and those lying down letting

the tears run down their cheeks
not because they are afraid but because as tsao kung says

 all have embraced the firm resolution to do or

die we may remember that the heroes of the iliad were equally

childlike in showing their emotion chang y alludes to the

mournful parting at the  i river between  ching ko and his

friends when the former was sent to attempt the life of the king

of chin afterwards first emperor in  bc the tears of all

flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and uttered the

following lines   the shrill blast

is blowing chilly the burn your champion is goingnot to

return
but let them once be brought to bay and they will display the courage

of a chu or a kuei
 was the personal name of  chuan chu a native of the wu

state and contemporary with sun tz himself who was employed by

 kungtz kuang better known as ho l wang to assassinate

his sovereign  wang liao with a dagger which he secreted in

the belly of a fish served up at a banquet he succeeded in his

attempt but was immediately hacked to pieces by the kings

bodyguard this was in  bc the other hero referred to 

tsao kuei or tsao  mo performed the exploit which has made

his name famous  years earlier in  bc lu had been

thrice defeated by chi and was just about to conclude a treaty

surrendering a large slice of territory when tsao kuei suddenly

seized  huan kung the duke of chi as he stood on the altar

steps and held a dagger against his chest none of the dukes

retainers dared to move a muscle and tsao kuei proceeded to

demand full restitution declaring that lu was being unjustly

treated because she was a smaller and weaker state huan kung in

peril of his life was obliged to consent whereupon tsao kuei

flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the

terrified assemblage without having so much as changed colour as

was to be expected the duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the

bargain but his wise old counsellor  kuan chung pointed out

to him the impolicy of breaking his word and the upshot was that

this bold stroke regained for lu the whole of what she had lost

in three pitched battles for another anecdote of tsao kuei see

vii   note and for the biographies of these three bravos

tsao chuan and ching see shih chi ch 
 
the skilful tactician may be likened to the shuaijan now the

shuaijan is a snake that is found in the chang mountains
 means suddenly or rapidly and the snake in question

was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements

through this passage the term has now come to be used in the

sense of military manuvres the  have apparently not been

identified

strike at its head and you will be attacked by its tail strike at

its tail and you will be attacked by its head strike at its middle
another reading in the y lan for  is  belly
and you will be attacked by head and tail both
 
asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuaijan
that is as mei yaochn says  is it

possible to make the front and rear of an army each swiftly

responsive to attack on the other just as though they were parts

of a single living body
i should answer yes for the men of wu and the men of yeh are enemies
cf vi  
yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a

storm they will come to each others assistance just as the left hand

helps the right
the meaning is if two enemies will help each other in a time

of common peril how much more should two parts of the same

army bound together as they are by every tie of interest and

fellowfeeling yet it is notorious that many a campaign has been

ruined through lack of cooperation especially in the case of

allied armies
 
hence it is not enough to put ones trust in the tethering of horses
 is said here to be equivalent to 
and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground
these quaint devices to prevent ones army from running away

recall the athenian hero sphanes who carried an anchor with him

at the battle of plataea by means of which he fastened himself

firmly to one spot see herodotus ix  it is not enough

says sun tz to render flight impossible by such mechanical

means you will not succeed unless your men have tenacity and

unity of purpose and above all a spirit of sympathetic

cooperation this is the lesson which can be learned from the

shuaijan
 
the principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of

courage which all must reach
literally level the courage of all as though it were that of

one if the ideal army is to form a single organic whole then it

follows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts

must be of the same quality or at any rate must not fall below a

certain standard wellingtons seemingly ungrateful description of

his army at waterloo as the worst he had ever commanded meant no

more than that it was deficient in this important particularunity

of spirit and courage had he not foreseen the belgian defections

and carefully kept those troops in the background he would almost

certainly have lost the day
 
how to make the best of both strong and weakthat is a question

involving the proper use of ground
this is rather a hard sentence on the first reading but the key

to it will be found firstly in the pause after  and next in

the meaning of  itself the best equivalent for this that i

can think of is the german zur geltung kommen mei yaochns

paraphrase is  the way to eliminate the

differences of strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to

utilise accidental features of the ground less reliable troops

if posted in strong positions will hold out as long as better

troops on more exposed terrain the advantage of position

neutralises the inferiority in stamina and courage col henderson

says with all respect to the text books and to ordinary

tactical teaching i am inclined to think that the study of ground

is often overlooked and that by no means sufficient importance

is attached to the selection of positions  and to the immense

advantages that are to be derived whether you are defending or

attacking from the proper utilisation of natural features
 
thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were

leading a single man willynilly by the hand

tu mu says  the simile has reference to the ease with which

he does it  means that he makes it impossible for his

troops to do otherwise than obey chang y quotes a jingle to be

found in wu tz ch  
 
it is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy

upright and just and thus maintain order
 seems to combine the meanings noiseless and imperturbable

both of which attributes would of course conduce to secrecy tu mu

explains  as  deep and inscrutable and  as 

fair and unbiassed mei yaochn alone among the commentators

takes  in the sense of  selfcontrolled  and  are

causally connected with  and  respectively this is not brought

out at all in capt calthrops rendering the general should be

calm inscrutable just and prudent the last adjective

moreover can in no sense be said to represent 
 
he must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and

appearances
literally to deceive their eyes and ears being here used as

a verb in the sense of 
and thus keep them in total ignorance
tsao kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms 

the troops must not be allowed to share your schemes

in the beginning they may only rejoice with you over their happy

outcome to mystify mislead and surprise the enemy is one of

the first principles in war as has been frequently pointed out

but how about the other processthe mystification of ones own

men those who may think that sun tz is overemphatic on this

point would do well to read col hendersons remarks on stonewall

jacksons valley campaign the infinite pains he says with

which jackson sought to conceal even from his most trusted staff

officers his movements his intentions and his thoughts a

commander less thorough would have pronounced uselessetc

etc in the year  ad as we read in ch  of the hou

han shu pan chao took the field with  men from khotan

and other central asian states with the object of crushing

yarkand the king of kutcha replied by dispatching his chief

commander to succour the place with an army drawn from the

kingdoms of wnsu kumo and weitou totalling  men pan

chao summoned his officers and also the king of khotan to a

council of war and said our forces are now outnumbered and

unable to make head against the enemy the best plan then is for

us to separate and disperse each in a different direction the

king of khotan will march away by the easterly route and i will

then return myself towards the west let us wait until the evening

drum has sounded and then start pan chao now secretly released

the prisoners whom he had taken alive and the king of kutcha was

thus informed of his plans much elated by the news the latter

set off at once at the head of  horsemen to bar pan chaos

retreat in the west while the king of wnsu rode eastwards with

 horse in order to intercept the king of khotan as soon as

pan chao knew that the two chieftains had gone he called his

divisions together got them well in hand and at cockcrow

hurled them against the army of yarkand as it lay encamped the

barbarians panicstricken fled in confusion and were closely

pursued by pan chao over  heads were brought back as

trophies besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle

and valuables of every description yarkand then capitulating

kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces

from that time forward pan chaos prestige completely overawed

the countries of the west in this case we see that the chinese

general not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real

plans but actually took the bold step of dividing his army in

order to deceive the enemy
 
by altering his arrangements and changing his plans
wang hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem

twice he says 
he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge
note that  denotes the enemy as opposed to the  of  

capt calthrop not perceiving this joins the two paragraphs into

one chang y quotes  as saying

 the axiom that war is based on deception

does not apply only to deception of the enemy you must deceive

even your own soldiers make them follow you but without letting

them know why

by shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes he prevents the

enemy from anticipating his purpose
wang hsi paraphrases  as  camp on easy ground and

chang y follows him saying  but this is an

utterly untenable view for  cf vii  chia lin retaining

his old interpretation of those words is now obliged to explain

 as cause the enemy to shift his camp which is awkward in

the extreme
 
at the critical moment the leader of an army acts like one who has

climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him
i must candidly confess that i do not understand the syntax of

 though the meaning is fairly plain the difficulty has

evidently been felt for tu mu tells us that one text omits 

it is more likely however that a couple of characters have

dropped out
he carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand
 literally releases the spring see v   that is

takes some decisive step which makes it impossible for the army to

returnlike  hsiang y who sunk his ships after crossing a

river chn hao followed by chia lin understands the words less

well as  puts forth every artifice at his command but 

in this derived sense occurs nowhere else in sun tz
 
he burns his boats and breaks his cookingpots
omitted in the tu shu
like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep he drives his men this way

and that and none knows whither he is going
the tu shu inserts another  after  tu mu says

 the army is only cognisant of orders to

advance or retreat it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of

attacking and conquering

 
to muster his host and bring it into dangerthis may be termed the

business of the general
sun tz means that after mobilisation there should be no delay in

aiming a blow at the enemys heart with  cf supra 

  note how he returns again and again to this point

among the warring states of ancient china desertion was no doubt

a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the armies

of today
 
the different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground
chang y says  one must not be hidebound in

interpreting the rules for the nine varieties of ground
the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics
the use of  contraction and expansion may be illustrated by

the saying  which almost exactly corresponds to the french

il faut reculer pour mieux sauter capt calthrop more

suo avoids a real translation and has the suiting of the means

to the occasion
and the fundamental laws of human nature these are things that must

most certainly be studied
 
when invading hostile territory the general principle is that

penetrating deeply brings cohesion penetrating but a short way means

dispersion
cf supra  
 
when you leave your own country behind and take your army across

neighbouring territory
chang ys paraphrase is 
you find yourself on critical ground

this ground is cursorily mentioned in viii   but it does not

figure among the nine  of this chapter or the six  in chap

x ones first impulse would be to translate it distant ground

 is commonly used in the sense of distant lands but this

if we can trust the commentators is precisely what is not meant

here mei yaochn says it is  a position

not far enough advanced to be called facile and not near enough

to home to be called dispersive but something between the two

that of course does not explain the name  which seems to imply

that the general has severed his communications and temporarily

cut himself off from his base thus wang hsi says it is ground

separated from home by an interjacent state whose territory we

have had to cross in order to reach it hence it is incumbent

on us to settle our business there quickly he adds that this

position is of rare occurrence which is the reason why it is not

included among the  capt calthrop gives but a poor rendering

of this sentence to leave home and cross the borders is to be

free from interference
when there are means of communication
the tu shu reads  for 
on all four sides the ground is one of intersecting highways
from  down to the end of   we have some of the definitions

of the early part of the chapter repeated in slightly different

language capt calthrop omits these altogether
 
when you penetrate deeply into a country it is serious ground when

you penetrate but a little way it is facile ground
 
when you have the enemys strongholds on your rear
  
and narrow passes in front it is hemmedin ground when there is no

place of refuge at all it is desperate ground
 
therefore on dispersive ground i would inspire my men with unity of

purpose

this end according to tu mu is best attained by remaining on the

defensive and avoiding battle cf supra  
on facile ground i would see that there is close connection between

all parts of my army
the tung tien has  instead of  the present reading is

supported by the  of chng yuhsien as tu mu says the object

is to guard against two possible contingencies 

 the desertion of our own troops  a sudden attack

on the part of the enemy cf vii    mei yaochn

says  on the march the regiments should be

in close touch in an encampment there should be continuity

between the fortifications he seems to have forgotten by the

way what sun tz says above 
 
on contentious ground i would hurry up my rear
this is tsao kungs interpretation chang y adopts it saying

 we must quickly bring up our rear so that

head and tail may both reach the goal that is they must not be

allowed to straggle up a long way apart mei yaochn offers

another equally plausible explanation 

supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position and

we are behind him we should advance with all speed in order to

dispute its possession  would thus denote the enemy  being

the preposition and  would retain its usual intransitive sense

cf vii    chn hao on the other hand assuming

that the enemy has had time select his own ground quotes vi  

where sun tz warns us against coming exhausted to the attack his

own idea of the situation is rather vaguely expressed



if there is a favourable

position lying in front of you detach a picked body of troops to

occupy it then if the enemy relying on their numbers come up to

make a fight for it you may fall quickly their rear with your

main body and victory will be assured it was thus he adds

that chao sh beat the army of chin see p  li chan would

read  for  it is not easy to see why

 
on open ground i would keep a vigilant eye on my defences
as wang hsi says  fearing a surprise attack the

tung tien reads here  see next sentence
on ground of intersecting highways i would consolidate my alliances
the tung tien reads  which tu yu explains as watching

the market towns  the hotbeds of revolution capt

calthrop translates  by the same words as  in  

cultivate intercourse
 
on serious ground i would try to ensure a continuous stream of

supplies
the commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder

not as one might expect to an unbroken communication with a home

base one text indeed gives the reading  cf   capt

calthrops be careful of supplies fails to render the force of 
on difficult ground i would keep pushing on along the road
capt calthrops do not linger cannot be called a translation

but only a paraphrase of the paraphrase offered by tsao kung

 pass away from it in all haste
 
on hemmedin ground i would block any way of retreat
 to make it seem that i mean to defend the

position whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through

the enemys lines mng shih  in order to make my

soldiers fight with desperation mei yaochn 

fearing lest my men be tempted to run away wang hsi tu mu

points out that this is the converse of vii   where it is the

enemy who is surrounded in  ad  kao huan afterwards

emperor and canonised as  shnwu was surrounded by a great

army under  rhchu chao and others his own force was

comparatively small consisting only of  horse and something

under  foot the lines of investment had not been drawn very

closely together gaps being left at certain points but kao huan

instead of trying to escape actually made a shift to block all

the remaining outlets himself by driving into them a number of

oxen and donkeys roped together as soon as his officers and men

saw that there was nothing for it but to conquer or die their

spirits rose to an extraordinary pitch of exaltation and they

charged with such desperate ferocity that the opposing ranks broke

and crumbled under their onslaught see tu mus commentary and

 ch  fol 
on desperate ground i would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness

of saving their lives
tu yu says  burn your baggage

and impedimenta throw away your stores and provisions choke up

the wells destroy your cookingstoves and make it plain to your

men that they cannot survive but must fight to the death mei

yaochn says epigrammatically  the only chance of life

lies in giving up all hope of it this concludes what sun tz has

to say about grounds and the variations corresponding to them

reviewing the passages which bear on this important subject we

cannot fail to be struck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion

in which it is treated sun tz begins abruptly in viii   to

enumerate variations before touching on grounds at all but

only mentions five namely nos    and  of the subsequent

list and one that is not included in it a few varieties of

ground are dealt with in the earlier portion of chap ix and then

chap x sets forth six new grounds with six variations of plan

to match none of these is mentioned again though the first

is hardly to be distinguished from ground no  in the next

chapter at last in chap xi we come to the nine grounds par

excellence immediately followed by the variations this takes us

down to   in   fresh definitions are provided for nos

    and  in the order given as well as for the tenth

ground noticed in chap viii and finally the nine variations

are enumerated once more from beginning to end all with the

exception of   and  being different from those previously

given though it is impossible to account for the present state

of sun tzs text a few suggestive facts may be brought into

prominence  chap viii according to the title should deal

with nine variations whereas only five appear  it is an

abnormally short chapter  chap xi is entitled the nine

grounds several these are defined twice over besides which there

are two distinct lists of the corresponding variations  the

length of the chapter is disproportionate being double that of

any other except ix i do not propose to draw any inferences from

these facts beyond the general conclusion that sun tzs work

cannot have come down to us in the shape in which it left his

hands chap viii is obviously defective and probably out of

place while xi seems to contain matter that has either been added

by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere
 
for it is the soldiers disposition to offer an obstinate resistance

when surrounded to fight hard when he cannot help himself and to

obey promptly when he has fallen into danger
 is rendered by capt calthrop to pursue the enemy if he

retreat but  cannot mean to retreat its primary sense is

to pass over hence to go too far to exceed or to err here

however the word has lost all implication of censure and appears

to mean to pass the boundary line dividing safety from danger

or as chang y puts it  to be deeply involved in a

perilous position the latter commentator alludes to the conduct

of pan chaos devoted followers in  ad the story runs thus in

the hou han shu ch  fol  vo when pan chao arrived at

 shanshan  kuang the king of the country received him at

first with great politeness and respect but shortly afterwards

his behaviour underwent a sudden change and he became remiss

and negligent pan chao spoke about this to the officers of his

suite have you not noticed he said that kuangs polite

intentions are on the wane this must signify that envoys have

come from the northern barbarians and that consequently he is in

a state of indecision not knowing with which side to throw in his

lot that surely is the reason the truly wise man we are told

can perceive things before they have come to pass how much more

then those that are already manifest thereupon he called one of

the natives who had been assigned to his service and set a trap

for him saying where are those envoys from the hsiungnu who

arrived some days ago the man was so taken aback that between

surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth pan

chao keeping his informant carefully under lock and key then

summoned a general gathering of his officers thirtysix in all

and began drinking with them when the wine had mounted into their

heads a little he tried to rouse their spirit still further by

addressing them thus gentlemen here we are in the heart of an

isolated region anxious to achieve riches and honour by some

great exploit now it happens that an ambassador from the

hsiungnu arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago and the

result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our

royal host has disappeared should this envoy prevail upon him to

seize our party and hand us over to the hsiungnu our bones will

become food for the wolves of the desert what are we to do with

one accord the officers replied standing as we do in peril of

our lives we will follow our commander through life and death

 for the sequel of this adventure see

chap xii   note
 
we cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are

acquainted with their designs we are not fit to lead an army on

the march unless we are familiar with the face of the countryits

mountains and forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and

swamps we shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account

unless we make use of local guides
these three sentences are repeated from vii  in order

to emphasise their importance the commentators seem to think i

prefer to regard them as interpolated here in order to form an

antecedent to the following words with regard to local guides

sun tz might have added that there is always the risk of going

wrong either through their treachery or some misunderstanding

such as livy records xxii  hannibal we are told ordered a

guide to lead him into the neighbourhood of casinum where there

was an important pass to be occupied but his carthaginian accent

unsuited to the pronunciation of latin names caused the guide to

understand casilinum instead of casinum and turning from his

proper route he took the army in that direction the mistake not

being discovered until they had almost arrived
 
to be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles
referring i think to what is contained in    tsao kung

thinking perhaps of the  in viii   takes them to be

 the advantages and disadvantages attendant on the nine

varieties of ground the tu shu reads 
does not befit a warlike prince
 one who rules by force was a term specially used for those

princes who established their hegemony over other feudal states

the famous  of the th century bc were   duke huan

of chi   duke wn of chin   duke hsiang of sung

  prince chuang of chu   duke mu of chin their

reigns covered the period  bc
 
when a warlike prince attacks a powerful state his generalship shows

itself in preventing the concentration of the enemys forces he

overawes his opponents
here and in the next sentence the y lan inserts  after 
and their allies are prevented from joining against him
mei yaochn constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are

so much affected by the chinese in attacking a powerful state

if you can divide her forces you will have a superiority in

strength if you have a superiority in strength you will overawe

the enemy if you overawe the enemy the neighbouring states will

be frightened and if the neighbouring states are frightened the

enemys allies will be prevented from joining her the following

gives a stronger meaning to   if the

great state has once been defeated before she has had time to

summon her allies then the lesser states will hold aloof and

refrain from massing their forces chn hao and chang y take

the sentence in quite another way the former says powerful

though a prince may be if he attacks a large state he will be

unable to raise enough troops and must rely to some extent on

external aid if he dispenses with this and with overweening

confidence in his own strength simply tries to intimidate the

enemy he will surely be defeated chang y puts his view thus

if we recklessly attack a large state our own people will be

discontented and hang back but if as will then be the case our

display of military force is inferior by half to that of the

enemy the other chieftains will take fright and refuse to join

us according to this interpretation  would refer not to the

 but to the  himself
 
hence he does not strive
for  the y lan reads 

to ally himself with all and sundry
 as in   stands for  the feudal princes or the

states ruled by them
nor does he foster the power of other states he carries out his own

secret designs
for  read shn in the meaning of  cf viii   the

commentators are unanimous on this point and we must therefore

beware of translating  by secretly selfconfident or the

like capt calthrop omitting  has he has confidence in

himself
keeping his antagonists in awe
the train of thought appears to be this secure against a

combination of his enemies  he

can afford to reject entangling alliances and simply pursue his

own secret designs his prestige enabling him to dispense with

external friendships li chan
thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms
this paragraph though written many years before the chin state

became a serious menace is not a bad summary of the policy by

which the famous six chancellors gradually paved the way for her

final triumph under shih huang ti chang y following up his

previous note thinks that sun tz is condemning this attitude of

coldblooded selfishness and haughty isolation he again refers 

to the warlike prince thus making it appear that in the end he is

bound to succumb
 
bestow rewards without regard to rule
wu tz ch  less wisely says  let advance be

richly rewarded and retreat be heavily punished
issue orders
 literally hang or post up
without regard to previous arrangements
 in order to prevent treachery says wang hsi the general

meaning is made clear by tsao kungs quotation from the ssma

fa  give instructions only on sighting the enemy

give rewards only when you see deserving deeds  however

presents some difficulty tsao kungs paraphrase 

i take to mean the final instructions you give to your army

should not correspond with those that have been previously posted

up chang y simplifies this into  your arrangements

should not be divulged beforehand and chia lin says 

there should be no fixity in your rules and arrangements not

only is there danger in letting your plans be known but war often

necessitates the entire reversal of them at the last moment
and you will be able to handle a whole army
 according to tsao kung is here equal to  the exact meaning

is brought out more clearly in the next paragraph
as though you had to do with but a single man
cf supra  
 
confront your soldiers with the deed itself never let them know your

design
literally do not tell them words ie do not give your

reasons for any order lord mansfield once told a junior colleague

to give no reasons for his decisions and the maxim is even more

applicable to a general than to a judge capt calthrop translates

this sentence with beautiful simplicity orders should direct the

soldiers that is all
when the outlook is bright bring it before their eyes but tell them

nothing when the situation is gloomy
 
place your army in deadly peril and it will survive plunge it into

desperate straits and it will come off in safety
compare the paradoxical saying  these words of

sun tz were once quoted by han hsin in explanation of the tactics

he employed in one of his most brilliant battles already alluded

to on p  in  bc he was sent against the army of chao

and halted ten miles from the mouth of the  chinghsing pass

where the enemy had mustered in full force here at midnight

he detached a body of  light cavalry every man of which was

furnished with a red flag their instructions were to make their

way through narrow defiles and keep a secret watch on the enemy

when the men of chao see me in full flight han hsin said they

will abandon their fortifications and give chase this must be the

sign for you to rush in pluck down the chao standards and set

up the red banners of  han in their stead turning then to

his other officers he remarked our adversary holds a strong

position and is not likely to come out and attack us until he

sees the standard and drums of the commanderinchief for fear

i should turn back and escape through the mountains so saying

he first of all sent out a division consisting of  men and

ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to the

river  ti seeing this manuvre the whole army of chao broke

into loud laughter by this time it was broad daylight and han

hsin displaying the generalissimos flag marched out of the pass

with drums beating and was immediately engaged by the enemy a

great battle followed lasting for some time until at length han

hsin and his colleague  chang ni leaving drums and banner on

the field fled to the division on the river bank where another

fierce battle was raging the enemy rushed out to pursue them and

to secure the trophies thus denuding their ramparts of men but

the two generals succeeded in joining the other army which was

fighting with the utmost desperation the time had now come for

the  horsemen to play their part as soon as they saw the men

of chao following up their advantage they galloped behind the

deserted walls tore up the enemys flags and replaced them by

those of han when the chao army turned back from the pursuit the

sight of these red flags struck them with terror convinced that

the hans had got in and overpowered their king they broke up in

wild disorder every effort of their leader to stay the panic

being in vain then the han army fell on them from both sides and

completed the rout killing a great number and capturing the rest

amongst whom was king  ya himself after the battle some of

han hsins officers came to him and said in the art of war we

are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear and a river

or marsh on the left front this appears to be a blend of sun tz

and tai kung see ix   and note you on the contrary

ordered us to draw up our troops with the river at our back under

these conditions how did you manage to gain the victory the

general replied i fear you gentlemen have not studied the art of

war with sufficient care is it not written there plunge your

army into desperate straits and it will come off in safety place

it in deadly peril and it will survive had i taken the usual

course i should never have been able to bring my colleagues

round what says the military classic swoop down on the

marketplace and drive the men off to fight  this

passage does not occur in the present text of sun tz if i had

not placed my troops in a position where they were obliged to

fight for their lives but had allowed each man to follow his own

discretion there would have been a general dbandade and it

would have been impossible to do anything with them the officers

admitted the force of his argument and said these are higher

tactics than we should have been capable of see chien han

shu ch  ff  
 
for it is precisely when a force has fallen into harms way that it is

capable of striking a blow for victory
danger has a bracing effect
 
success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to

the enemys purpose
tsao kung says  feign stupidityby an appearance of

yielding and falling in with the enemys wishes chang ys note

makes the meaning clear if the enemy shows an inclination to

advance lure him on to do so if he is anxious to retreat delay

on purpose that he may carry out his intention the object is to

make him remiss and contemptuous before we deliver our attack
 
by persistently hanging on the enemys flank
i understand the first four words to mean accompanying the enemy

in one direction tsao kung says  unite the soldiers

and make for the enemy but such a violent displacement of

characters is quite indefensible mei yaochn is the only

commentator who seems to have grasped the meaning 

the tu shu reads 
we shall succeed in the long run
literally after a thousand li
in killing the commanderinchief
always a great point with the chinese
 
this is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning
the tu shu has  and yet another reading mentioned

by tsao kung is  capt calthrop omits this sentence

after having thus translated the two preceding discover the

enemys intentions by conforming to his movements when these are

discovered then with one stroke the general may be killed even

though he be one hundred leagues distant
 
on the day that you take up your command
 does not mean when war is declared as capt calthrop says

nor yet exactly as tsao kung paraphrases it  when your

plans are fixed when you have mapped out your campaign the

phrase is not given in the pei wn yn fu there being no

causal connection discoverable between this and the preceding

sentence  must perforce be left untranslated
block the frontier passes
 is explained by mei yaochn as 
destroy the official tallies
the locus classicus for these tallies is chou li xiv fol 

imperial edition  the generic term

thus appears to be   being the special kind used at citygates

and on the frontier they were tablets of bamboo or wood one half

of which was issued as a permit or passport by the official in

charge of a gate  or  cf the  borderwarden of lun

y iii  who may have had similar duties when this half was

returned to him within a fixed period he was authorised to open

the gate and let the traveller through
and stop the passage of all emissaries
either to or from the enemys country
 
be stern in the councilchamber
show no weakness and insist on your plans being ratified by the

sovereign  indicates a hall or temple in the palace cf i 

 it is not clear if other officers would be present hardly

anything can be made of  the reading of the standard text so i

have adopted tu mus conjecture  which appears in the tu shu
so that you may control the situation

tsao kung explains  by  and ho shih by  another reading

is  and mei yaochn adopting this understands the whole

sentence to mean take the strictest precautions to ensure secrecy

in your deliberations capt calthrop glides rather too smoothly

over the rough places his translation is conduct the business

of the government with vigilance
 
if the enemy leaves a door open you must rush in
this looks a very simple sentence yet tsao kung is the only

commentator who takes it as i have done mng shih followed by

mei yaochn and chang y defines  as  spies and

makes  an active verb if spies come from the enemy we must

quickly let them in but i cannot find that the words  have

this meaning anywhere else on the other hand they may be taken

as two verbs  expressing the enemys indecision whether

to advance or retreat that being the best moment to attack him

cf tao t ching chap x  also li chi 

i ii  it is not easy to choose between this and tsao kungs

explanation the fact that  occurs shortly afterwards in 

 might be adduced in support of either  must be understood in

the sense of  or  the only way to avoid this is to put 

between commas and translate if we leave a door open the enemy

is sure to rush in
 
forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear
cf supra  
and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground
capt calthrop hardly attempts to translate this difficult

paragraph but invents the following instead discover what he

most values and plan to seize it chn haos explanation

however is clear enough



if i manage to seize a favourable

position but the enemy does not appear on the scene the

advantage thus obtained cannot be turned to any practical account

he who intends therefore to occupy a position of importance

to the enemy must begin by making an artful appointment so to

speak with his antagonist and cajole him into going there as

well mei yaochn explains that this artful appointment is

to be made through the medium of the enemys own spies who will

carry back just the amount of information that we choose to give

them then having cunningly disclosed our intentions 

we must manage though starting after the enemy to arrive before

him vii   we must start after him in order to ensure his

marching thither we must arrive before him in order to capture

the place without trouble taken thus the present passage lends

some support to mei yaochns interpretation of  
 
walk in the path defined by rule
 stands  a markingline hence a rule of conduct see

mencius vii  xli  tsao kung explains it by the similar

metaphor  square and compasses the baldness of the sentiment

rather inclines me to favour the reading  adopted by chia lin in

place of  which yields an exactly opposite sense namely

discard hard and fast rules chia lin says 

victory is the only thing that matters and this cannot be

achieved by adhering to conventional canons it is unfortunate

that this variant rests on very slight authority for the sense

yielded is certainly much more satisfactory napoleon as we know

according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated won

his battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare
and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive

battle
the last four words of the chinese are omitted by capt calthrop

tu mu says  conform to the enemys

tactics until a favourable opportunity offers then come forth and

engage in a battle that shall prove decisive
 
at first then exhibit the coyness of a maiden until the enemy gives

you an opening afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare and

it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you

as the hare is noted for its extreme timidity the comparison

hardly appears felicitous but of course sun tz was thinking only

of its speed the words have been taken to mean you must flee

from the enemy as quickly as an escaping hare but this is rightly

rejected by tu mu capt calthrop is wrong in translating 

rabbit rabbits are not indigenous to china and were certainly

not known there in the th century bc the last sixteen

characters evidently form a sort of fourline jingle chap x it

may be remembered closed in similar fashion


xii 



the attack by fire

rather more than half the chapter   is devoted to the subject

of fire after which the author branches off into other topics
 
sun tz said there are five ways of attacking with fire the first

is to burn soldiers in their camp
so tu mu li chan says  set fire to the camp

and kill the soldiers when they try to escape from the flames

pan chao sent on a diplomatic mission to the king of shanshan

see xi   note found himself placed in extreme peril by

the unexpected arrival of an envoy from the hsiungnu the mortal

enemies of the chinese in consultation with his officers he

exclaimed never venture never win the only course open

to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under

cover of night when they will not be able to discern our numbers

profiting by their panic we shall exterminate them completely

this will cool the kings courage and cover us with glory besides

ensuring the success of our mission the officers all replied

that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the

intendant  pan chao then fell into a passion it is

today he cried that our fortunes must be decided the

intendant is only a humdrum civilian who on hearing of our

project will certainly be afraid and everything will be brought

to light an inglorious death is no worthy fate for valiant

warriors all then agreed to do as he wished accordingly as

soon as night came on he and his little band quickly made their

way to the barbarian camp a strong gale was blowing at the time

pan chao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind

the enemys barracks it being arranged that when they saw flames

shoot up they should begin drumming and yelling with all their

might the rest of his men armed with bows and crossbows he

posted in ambuscade at the gate of the camp he then set fire to

the place from the windward side whereupon a deafening noise of

drums and shouting arose on the front and rear of the hsiungnu

who rushed out pellmell in frantic disorder pan chao slew three

of them with his own hand while his companions cut off the heads

of the envoy and thirty of his suite the remainder more than a

hundred in all perished in the flames on the following day pan

chao went back and informed  kuo hsn the intendant of what

he had done the latter was greatly alarmed and turned pale

but pan chao divining his thoughts said with uplifted hand

although you did not go with us last night i should not think

sir of taking sole credit for our exploit this satisfied kuo

hsn and pan chao having sent for kuang king of shanshan

showed him the head of the barbarian envoy the whole kingdom was

seized with fear and trembling which pan chao took steps to

allay by issuing a public proclamation then taking the kings

son as hostage he returned to make his report to  tou ku

hou han shu ch  ff  
the second is to burn stores
tu mu says  provisions fuel and fodder in order to

subdue the rebellious population of kiangnan  kao kng

recommended wn ti of the sui dynasty to make periodical raids and

burn their stores of grain a policy which in the long run proved

entirely successful  ch  fol 
the third is to burn baggagetrains
an example given is the destruction of  yan shaos waggons and

impedimenta by tsao tsao in  ad
the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines
tu mu says that the things contained in  and  are the same he

specifies weapons and other implements bullion and clothing cf

vii  
the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy
no fewer than four totally diverse explanations of this sentence

are given by the commentators not one of which is quite

satisfactory it is obvious at any rate that the ordinary

meaning of  regiment or company is here inadmissible in

spite of tu mus note  i must regard company

burning capt calthrops rendering as nonsense pure and simple

we may also i think reject the very forced explanation given

by li chan mei yaochn and chang y of whom the lastnamed

says  burning a regiments weapons so that the

soldiers may have nothing to fight with that leaves only two

solutions open one favoured by chia lin and ho shih is to take

 in the somewhat uncommon sense of a road   the commentary

on a passage in the  quoted in kang hsi defines 

read sui as  a difficult road leading through a

valley here it would stand for the  line of supplies which

might be effectually interrupted if the country roundabout was

laid waste with fire finally the interpretation which i have

adopted is that given by tu yu in the tung tien he reads 

which is not absolutely necessary  chui being sometimes used

in the same sense with the following note 

to drop fire into the enemys camp the

method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows

alight by dipping them into a brazier and then shoot them from

powerful crossbows into the enemys lines
 
in order to carry out an attack with fire we must have means available
tsao kung thinks that  traitors in the enemys camp are

referred to he thus takes  as the efficient cause only but

chn hao is more likely to be right in saying  we

must have favourable circumstances in general not merely traitors

to help us chia lin says  we must avail ourselves of wind

and dry weather
the material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness
 is explained by tsao kung as  appliances for making

fire tu mu suggests  dry vegetable matter

reeds brushwood straw grease oil etc here we have the

material cause chang y says  vessels for

hoarding fire stuff for lighting fires
 
there is a proper season for making attacks with fire and special

days for starting a conflagration

a fire must not be begun  recklessly or  at haphazard
 
the proper season is when the weather is very dry the special days

are those when the moon is in the constellations of the sieve the

wall the wing or the crossbar
these are respectively the th th th and th of the

 twentyeight stellar mansions corresponding roughly

to sagittarius pegasus crater and corvus the original text

followed by the tu shu has  in place of  the present

reading rests on the authority of the tung tien and y lan

tu mu says  for  both tung tien and y lan

give the more precise location  mei yaochn tells us

that by  is meant the tail of the  dragon by  the eastern

part of that constellation by  and  the tail of the  quail
for these four are all days of rising wind
 is elliptical for   hsiao i afterwards

fourth emperor of the liang dynasty ad  is quoted by tu

yu as saying that the days  of spring  of summer  of

autumn and  of winter bring fierce gales of wind and rain
 
in attacking with fire one should be prepared to meet five possible

developments
i take  as qualifying  not  and therefore think that chang

y is wrong in referring  to the five methods of attack set

forth in   what follows has certainly nothing to do with these
 
 when fire breaks out inside the enemys camp respond at once
the y lan incorrectly reads  for 
with an attack from without

 
 if there is an outbreak of fire but the enemys soldiers remain

quiet bide your time and do not attack
the original text omits  the prime object of attacking with

fire is to throw the enemy into confusion if this effect is not

produced it means that the enemy is ready to receive us hence

the necessity for caution
 
 when the force of the flames has reached its height follow it up

with an attack if that is practicable if not stay where you are
tsao kung says  if you see a possible way

advance but if you find the difficulties too great retire
 
 if it is possible to make an assault with fire from without do

not wait for it to break out within but deliver your attack at a

favourable moment
tu mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire

breaking out either accidentally we may suppose or by the

agency of incendiaries inside the enemys camp but he

continues 

if the enemy is settled in a waste place

littered with quantities of grass or if he has pitched his camp

in a position which can be burnt out we must carry our fire

against him at any seasonable opportunity and not wait on in

hopes of an outbreak occurring within for fear our opponents

should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation and thus

render our own attempts fruitless the famous  li ling once

baffled the  leader of the hsiungnu in this way the latter

taking advantage of a favourable wind tried to set fire to the

chinese generals camp but found that every scrap of combustible

vegetation in the neighbourhood had already been burnt down on

the other hand  potsai a general of the  yellow

turban rebels was badly defeated in  ad through his neglect

of this simple precaution at the head of a large army he was

besieging  changsh which was held by  huangfu sung

the garrison was very small and a general feeling of nervousness

pervaded the ranks so huangfu sung called his officers together

and said in war there are various indirect methods of attack

and numbers do not count for everything the commentator here

quotes sun tz v    and  now the rebels have pitched

their camp in the midst of thick grass  which will

easily burn when the wind blows if we set fire to it at night

they will be thrown into a panic and we can make a sortie and

attack them on all sides at once thus emulating the achievement

of tien tan see p  that same evening a strong breeze

sprang up so huangfu sung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds

together into torches and mount guard on the city walls after

which he sent out a band of daring men who stealthily made their

way through the lines and started the fire with loud shouts

and yells simultaneously a glare of light shot up from the

citywalls and huangfu sung sounding his drums led a rapid

charge which threw the rebels into confusion and put them to

headlong flight hou han shu ch  f  ro
 
 when you start a fire be to windward of it do not attack from

the leeward
chang y following tu yu says  when

you make a fire the enemy will retreat away from it if you

oppose his retreat and attack him then he will fight desperately

which will not conduce to your success a rather more obvious

explanation is given by tu mu if the wind is in the east begin

burning to the east of the enemy and follow up the attack

yourself from that side if you start the fire on the east side

and then attack from the west you will suffer in the same way as

your enemy
 
a wind that rises in the daytime lasts long but a night breeze soon

falls
cf lao tzs saying  a violent wind does not last the

space of a morning tao t ching chap  mei yaochn and

wang hsi say a day breeze dies down at nightfall and a night

breeze at daybreak this is what happens as a general rule the

phenomenon observed may be correct enough but how this sense is

to be obtained is not apparent
 
in every army the five developments connected with fire must be

known the movements of the stars calculated and a watch kept for the

proper days

tu mus commentary shows what has to be supplied in order to make

sense out of  he says  we

must make calculations as to the paths of the stars and watch for

the days on which wind will rise before making our attack with

fire chang y seems to take  in the sense of  we must not

only know how to assail our opponents with fire but also be on

our guard against similar attacks from them
 
hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence
i have not the least hesitation in rejecting the commentators

explanation of  as   thus chang y says  

will clearly ie obviously be able to gain the victory this

is not only clumsy in itself but does not balance  in the next

clause for  intelligent cf infra   and lun y xii 
those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of

strength
capt calthrop gives an extraordinary rendering of the paragraph

 if the attack is to be assisted the fire must be

unquenchable if water is to assist the attack the flood must be

overwhelming
 
by means of water an enemy may be intercepted but not robbed of all

his belongings
tsao kungs note is  we can merely

obstruct the enemys road or divide his army but not sweep away

all his accumulated stores water can do useful service but it

lacks the terrible destructive power of fire this is the reason

chang y concludes why the former is dismissed in a couple of

sentences whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail wu

tz ch  speaks thus of the two elements  if an army is encamped on

lowlying marshy ground from which the water cannot run off and

where the rainfall is heavy it may be submerged by a flood if an

army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds

and brambles and visited by frequent gales it may be

exterminated by fire

 
unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in

his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise for the

result is waste of time and general stagnation
this is one of the most perplexing passages in sun tz the

difficulty lies mainly in  of which two interpretations

appear possible most of the commentators understand  in the

sense not known to kang hsi of  reward or  promote

and  as referring to the merit of officers and men thus tsao

kung says  rewards for good service should not be

deferred a single day and tu mu if you do not take opportunity

to advance and reward the deserving your subordinates will not

carry out your commands and disaster will ensue  would then

probably mean  stoppage of expenditure or as chia lin

puts it  the grudging of expenditure for several reasons

however and in spite of the formidable array of scholars on the

other side i prefer the interpretation suggested by mei yaochn

alone whose words i will quote



those who want to make

sure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the

favourable moments when they come and not shrink on occasion from

heroic measures that is to say they must resort to such means of

attack as fire water and the like what they must not do and

what will prove fatal is to sit still and simply hold on to the

advantages they have got this retains the more usual meaning of

 and also brings out a clear connection of thought with the

previous part of the chapter with regard to  wang hsi

paraphrases it as  expending treasure and tiring out

lit ageing the army  of course is expenditure or waste

in general either of time money or strength but the soldier is

less concerned with the saving of money than of time for the

metaphor expressed in stagnation i am indebted to tsao kung

who says  capt calthrop gives a rendering which

bears but little relation to the chinese text unless victory or

possession be obtained the enemy quickly recovers and

misfortunes arise the war drags on and money is spent
 
hence the saying the enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead the

good general cultivates his resources

as sun tz quotes this jingle in support of his assertion in  

we must suppose  to stand for  or something analogous

the meaning seems to be that the ruler lays plans which the

general must show resourcefulness in carrying out it is now

plainer than ever that  cannot mean to reward nevertheless tu

mu quotes the following from the  ch 



the warlike prince controls his

soldiers by his authority knits them together by good faith and

by rewards makes them serviceable if faith decays there will be

disruption if rewards are deficient commands will not be

respected
 
move not unless you see an advantage
 the y lans variant for  is adopted by li chan and tu mu
use not your troops unless there is something to be gained fight not

unless the position is critical
sun tz may at times appear to be overcautious but he never goes

so far in that direction as the remarkable passage in the tao t

ching ch   i dare not take the

initiative but prefer to act on the defensive i dare not advance

an inch but prefer to retreat a foot
 
no ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own

spleen no general should fight a battle simply out of pique
again compare lao tz ch   chang y says that  is

a weaker word than  and is therefore applied to the general as

opposed to the sovereign the tung tien and y lan read 

for  and the latter  for 
 
if it is to your advantage make a forward move if not stay where

you are
this is repeated from xi   here i feel convinced that it is an

interpolation for it is evident that   ought to follow immediately

on   for  the tung tien and y lan have  capt calthrop

invents a sentence which he inserts before this one do not make war

unless victory may be gained thereby while he was about it he might

have credited sun tz with something slightly less inane
 
anger may in time change to gladness vexation may be succeeded by

content
according to chang y  denotes joy outwardly manifested in the

countenance  the inward sensation of happiness
 
but a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into

being
the wu state was destined to be a melancholy example of this

saying see p 
nor can the dead ever be brought back to life
 
hence the enlightened ruler is heedful and the good general full of

caution
 which usually means to warn is here equal to  this is a

good instance of how chinese characters which stand for ideas

refuse to be fettered by dictionarymade definitions the tu

shu reads  as in  
this is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact
it is odd that  should not have the same meaning here as in

iii   qv this has led me to consider whether it might not

be possible to take the earlier passage thus to preserve your

own army country regiment etc intact is better than to

destroy the enemys the two words do not appear in the tung

tien or the y lan capt calthrop misses the point by

translating then is the state secure and the army victorious in

battle


xiii 



the use of spies

 is really a vulgar form of  and does not appear in the shuo

wn in practice however it has gradually become a distinct

character with special meanings of its own and i have therefore

followed my edition of the standard text in retaining this form

throughout the chapter in vi   on the other hand the

correct form  will be found the evolution of the meaning spy

is worth considering for a moment provided it be understood that

this is very doubtful ground and that any dogmatism is out of

place the shuo wn defines  as  the old form of  a

crack or chink and on the whole we may accept  hs chiehs

analysis as not unduly fanciful  at

night a door is shut if when it is shut the light of the

moon is visible it must come through a chink from this

it is an easy step to the meaning space between or simply

between as for example in the phrase  to act as a

secret spy between enemies here  is the word which means spy

but we may suppose that constant association so affected the

original force of  that  could at last be dropped altogether

leaving  to stand alone with the same signification another

possible theory is that the word may first have come to mean  to

peep see  quoted in kang hsi which would naturally be

suggested by crack or crevice and afterwards the man who

peeps or spy
 
sun tz said raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching

them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on

the resources of the state the daily expenditure will amount to a

thousand ounces of silver

cf ii    
there will be commotion at home and abroad and men will drop down

exhausted on the highways
 which is omitted by the y lan appears at first sight

to be explained by the words immediately following so that the

obvious translation would be enforced idleness along the line

of march cf tao t ching ch   where

troops have been quartered brambles and thorns spring up the

commentators however say that  is here equivalent to a

meaning which is still retained in the phrase  tu mu refers 

to those who are engaged in conveying provisions to the army but

this can hardly be said to emerge clearly from sun tzs text

chang y has the note we may be reminded of the saying on

serious ground gather in plunder xi   why then should

carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highwaysthe

answer is that not victuals alone but all sorts of munitions of

war have to be conveyed to the army besides the injunction to

forage on the enemy only means that when an army is deeply

engaged in hostile territory scarcity of food must be provided

against hence without being solely dependent on the enemy for

corn we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted

flow of supplies then again there are places like salt deserts

 where provisions being unobtainable supplies from home

cannot be dispensed with
as many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their

labour
mei yaochn says  men will be lacking at the

ploughtail the allusion is to  the system of dividing land

into nine parts as shown in the character  each consisting

of a  or  about  acres the plot in the centre being

cultivated on behalf of the state by the tenants of the other

eight it was here also so tu mu tells us that their cottages

were built and a well sunk to be used by all in common see ii

  note these groups of eight peasant proprietors were called

 in time of war one of the families had to serve in the army

while the other seven contributed to its support 

thus by a levy of  men reckoning one ablebodied soldier

to each family the husbandry of  families would be affected
 
hostile armies may face each other for years striving for the

victory which is decided in a single day this being so to remain

in ignorance of the enemys condition simply because one grudges

the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments
for spies is of course the meaning though it would spoil the

effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually

mentioned at this point
is the height of inhumanity
sun tzs argument is certainly ingenious he begins by adverting

to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure

which war always brings in its train now unless you are kept

informed of the enemys condition and are ready to strike at the

right moment a war may drag on for years the only way to get

this information is to employ spies and it is impossible to

obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their

services but it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively

trifling amount for this purpose when every day that the war

lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum this grievous burden

falls on the shoulders of the poor and hence sun tz concludes

that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime

against humanity
 
one who acts thus is no leader of men no present help to his sovereign
an inferior reading for  is  thus explained by mei yaochn


no master of victory
this idea that the true object of war is peace has its root in

the national temperament of the chinese even so far back as 

bc these memorable words were uttered by prince  chuang of the

chu state    the

character for prowess  is made up of  to stay and  a

spear cessation of hostilities military prowess is seen in the

repression of cruelty the calling in of weapons the preservation

of the appointment of heaven the firm establishment of merit the

bestowal of happiness on the people putting harmony between the

princes the diffusion of wealth tso chuan  xii  ad

fin

 
thus what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike

and conquer and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men is

foreknowledge
that is knowledge of the enemys dispositions and what he means

to do
 
now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits
 by prayers or sacrifices says chang y  are the

disembodied spirits of men and  supernatural beings or gods
it cannot be obtained inductively from experience
tu mus note makes the meaning clear  he says is the same as

 reasoning by analogy  knowledge of the

enemy cannot be gained by reasoning from other analogous cases
nor by any deductive calculation
li chan says 

quantities like length breadth distance and magnitude are

susceptible of exact mathematical determination human actions

cannot be so calculated
 
knowledge of the enemys dispositions can only be obtained from other

men
mei yaochn has rather an interesting note

 knowledge of the

spiritworld is to be obtained by divination information in

natural science may be sought by inductive reasoning the laws of

the universe can be verified by mathematical calculation but the

dispositions of an enemy are ascertainable through spies and spies

alone

 
hence the use of spies of whom there are five classes  local

spies  inward spies  converted spies  doomed spies 

surviving spies
 
when these five kinds of spy are all at work none can discover the

secret system
 is explained by tu mu as  the way in which facts

leak out and dispositions are revealed
this is called
 is the reading of the standard text but the tung tien y

lan and tu shu all have 
divine manipulation of the threads
capt calthrop translates  the mysterious thread but mei

yaochns paraphrase  shows that what is meant is the

control of a number of threads
it is the sovereigns most precious faculty
cromwell one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry

leaders had officers styled scout masters whose business it

was to collect all possible information regarding the enemy

through scouts and spies etc and much of his success in war was

traceable to the previous knowledge of the enemys moves thus

gained
 
having local spies
 is the emended reading of chia lin and the tu shu for the

unintelligible  here and in   of the standard text which

nevertheless reads  in  
means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district
tu mu says in the enemys country win people over by kind

treatment and use them as spies

 
having inward spies making use of officials of the enemy
 includes both civil and military officials tu mu enumerates the

following classes as likely to do good service in this respect

worthy men who have been degraded from office criminals who have

undergone punishment also favourite concubines who are greedy

for gold men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions

or who have been passed over in the distribution of posts others

who are anxious that their side should be defeated in order that

they may have a chance of displaying their ability and talents

fickle turncoats who always want to have a foot in each boat

 officials of these several kinds he

continues should be secretly approached and bound to ones

interests by means of rich presents in this way you will be able

to find out the state of affairs in the enemys country ascertain

the plans that are being formed against you and moreover disturb

the harmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his

ministers the necessity for extreme caution however in dealing

with inward spies appears from an historical incident related

by ho shih  lo shang governor of  ichou sent his

general  wei po to attack the rebel  li hsiung of  shu in

his stronghold at  pi after each side had experienced a number

of victories and defeats li hsiung had recourse to the services

of a certain  potai a native of  wutu he began by

having him whipped until the blood came and then sent him off to

lo shang whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him

from inside the city and to give a fire signal at the right

moment for making a general assault lo shang confiding in these

promises marched out all his best troops and placed wei po and

others at their head with orders to attack at potais bidding

meanwhile li hsiungs general  li hsiang had prepared an

ambuscade on their line of march and potai having reared

long scalingladders against the city walls now lighted the

beaconfire wei pos men raced up on seeing the signal and began

climbing the ladders as fast as they could while others were

drawn up by ropes lowered from above more than a hundred of lo

shangs soldiers entered the city in this way every one of whom

was forthwith beheaded li hsiung then charged with all his

forces both inside and outside the city and routed the enemy

completely this happened in  ad i do not know where ho

shih got the story from it is not given in the biography of li

hsiung or that of his father li  t chin shu ch  

 
having converted spies getting hold of the enemys spies and using

them for our own purposes
by means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them

from the enemys service and inducing them to carry back false

information as well as to spy in turn on their own countrymen

thus tu yu  on the other hand  hsiao

shihhsien in defining the  says that we pretend not to

have detected him but contrive to let him carry away a false

impression of what is going on 

several of the commentators accept this as an alternative

definition but that it is not what sun tz meant is conclusively

proved by his subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy

generously   sqq ho shih notes three occasions on which

converted spies were used with conspicuous success  by tien

tan in his defence of chimo see supra p   by chao sh

on his march to oy see p  and by the wily  fan ch

in  bc when lien po was conducting a defensive campaign

against chin the king of chao strongly disapproved of lien pos

cautious and dilatory methods which had been unable to avert a

series of minor disasters and therefore lent a ready ear to the

reports of his spies who had secretly gone over to the enemy and

were already in fan chs pay they said the only thing which

causes chin anxiety is lest  chao kua should be made general

lien po they consider an easy opponent who is sure to be

vanquished in the long run now this chao kua was a son of the

famous chao sh from his boyhood he had been wholly engrossed

in the study of war and military matters until at last he came

to believe that there was no commander in the whole empire who

could stand against him his father was much disquieted by this

overweening conceit and the flippancy with which he spoke of such

a serious thing as war and solemnly declared that if ever kua was

appointed general he would bring ruin on the armies of chao this

was the man who in spite of earnest protests from his own mother

and the veteran statesman  lin hsiangju was now sent to

succeed lien po needless to say he proved no match for the

redoubtable po chi and the great military power of chin he

fell into a trap by which his army was divided into two and his

communications cut and after a desperate resistance lasting 

days during which the famished soldiers devoured one another he

was himself killed by an arrow and his whole force amounting

it is said to  men ruthlessly put to the sword see

 ch  ff 

 
having doomed spies doing certain things openly for purposes of

deception and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them

to the enemy
 is li chans conjecture for  which is found in the tung

tien and the y lan the tu shu unsupported by any good

authority adds  after  in that case the doomed spies would

be those of the enemy to whom our own spies had conveyed false

information but this is unnecessarily complicated tu yu gives

the best exposition of the meaning we ostentatiously do things

calculated to deceive our own spies who must be led to believe

that they have been unwittingly disclosed then when these spies

are captured in the enemys lines they will make an entirely

false report and the enemy will take measures accordingly only

to find that we do something quite different the spies will

thereupon be put to death capt calthrop makes a hopeless muddle

of the sentence as an example of doomed spies ho shih mentions

the prisoners released by pan chao in his campaign against

yarkand see p  he also refers to  tang chien who

in  ad was sent by tai tsung to lull the turkish khan 

chiehli into fancied security until li ching was able to deliver

a crushing blow against him chang y says that the turks revenged

themselves by killing tang chien but this is a mistake for we

read in both the old and the new tang history ch  fol  and

ch  fol  respectively that he escaped and lived on until

  li ichi played a somewhat similar part in 

bc when sent by the king of han to open peaceful negotiations

with chi he has certainly more claim to be described as a 

for the king of chi being subsequently attacked without warning

by han hsin and infuriated by what he considered the treachery of

li ichi ordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive
 
surviving spies finally are those who bring back news from the

enemys camp
this is the ordinary class of spies properly so called forming a

regular part of the army tu mu says 

your surviving spy must be a man of

keen intellect though in outward appearance a fool of shabby

exterior but with a will of iron he must be active robust

endowed with physical strength and courage thoroughly accustomed

to all sorts of dirty work able to endure hunger and cold and to

put up with shame and ignominy ho shih tells the following story

of  tahsi wu of the sui dynasty when he was governor of

eastern chin  shnwu of chi made a hostile movement upon

 shayan the emperor tai tsu  kao tsu sent tahsi wu to

spy upon the enemy he was accompanied by two other men all three

were on horseback and wore the enemys uniform when it was dark

they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemys camp and

stealthily crept up to listen until they succeeded in catching

the passwords used by the army then they got on their horses

again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of

nightwatchmen  and more than once happening to come

across a soldier who was committing some breach of discipline

they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgelling thus

they managed to return with the fullest possible information about

the enemys dispositions and received warm commendation from the

emperor who in consequence of their report was able to inflict a

severe defeat on his adversary with the above classification it

is interesting to compare the remarks of frederick the great
es giebt vielerley sorten von spions  geringe leute welche

sich von diesem handwerk meliren  doppelte spions  spions

von consequenz und endlich  diejenigen welche man zu diesem

unglcklichen hankwerk zwinget this of course is a bad

crossdivision the first class brgersleute bauern priesters

etc corresponds roughly to sun tzs local spies and the

third to inward spies of doppelte spions it is broadly stated

that they are employed um dem feinde falsche nachrichten

aufzubinden thus they would include both converted and doomed

spies fredericks last class of spies does not appear in sun

tzs list perhaps because the risk in using them is too great
 
hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate

relations to be maintained than with spies
the original text and the tu shu have  in place of the first

 tu mu and mei yaochn point out that the spy is privileged to

enter even the generals private sleepingtent capt calthrop has

an inaccurate translation in connection with the armies spies

should be treated with the greatest kindness

none should be more liberally rewarded
frederick concludes his chapter on spies with the words zu allem

diesem fge ich noch hinzu dass man in bezahlung der spions

freygebig ja verschwenderisch seyn muss ein mench der um eures

dienstes halber den strick waget verdienet dafr belohnet zu

werden
in no other business should greater secrecy be preserved
tu mu gives a graphic touch  that is to say all

communications with spies should be carried on mouthtoear

capt calthrop has all matters relating to spies are secret

which is distinctly feeble an inferior reading for  is  the

following remarks on spies may be quoted from turenne who made

perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander spies

are attached to those who give them most he who pays them ill is

never served they should never be known to anybody nor should

they know one another when they propose anything very material

secure their persons or have in your possession their wives

and children as hostages for their fidelity never communicate

anything to them but what it is absolutely necessary that they

should know
 
spies cannot be usefully employed
this is the nuance of tu yus paraphrase 
without a certain intuitive sagacity
mei yaochn says  in order to use them one

must know fact from falsehood and be able to discriminate between

honesty and doubledealing wang hsi takes  and  separately

defining the former as  intuitive perception and the

latter as  practical intelligence tu mu strangely refers

these attributes to the spies themselves 

before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity

of character and the extent of their experience and skill but he

continues  a brazen face and a crafty

disposition are more dangerous than mountains or rivers it takes

a man of genius to penetrate such so that we are left in some

doubt as to his real opinion on the passage

 
they cannot be properly managed without benevolence and

straightforwardness
chang y says that  means not grudging them honours and pay

 showing no distrust of their honesty when you have

attracted them by substantial offers you must treat them with

absolute sincerity then they will work for you with all their

might
 
without subtle ingenuity of mind one cannot make certain of the truth

of their reports
mei yaochn says be on your guard against the possibility of

spies going over to the service of the enemy the tung tien

and y lan read  for 
 
be subtle be subtle
cf vi    capt calthrop translates wonderful indeed

is the power of spies
and use your spies for every kind of business
 
if a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is

ripe he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret

was told
the chinese here is so concise and elliptical that some expansion

is necessary for the proper understanding of it  denotes

important information about the enemy obtained from a surviving

spy the subject of  however is not this information itself

but the secret stratagem built up on the strength of it  means

is heardby anybody else thus word for word we get if spy

matters are heard before our plans are carried out etc capt

calthrop in translating  the spy who told the matter

and the man who repeated the same may appeal to the authority of

the commentators but he surely misses the main point of sun tzs

injunction for whereas you kill the spy himself  as a

punishment for letting out the secret the object of killing the

other man is only as chn hao puts it  to stop his mouth

and prevent the news leaking any further if it had already been

repeated to others this object would not be gained either way

sun tz lays himself open to the charge of inhumanity though tu

mu tries to defend him by saying that the man deserves to be put

to death for the spy would certainly not have told the secret

unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him the

tung tien and y lan have the reading   etc

which while not affecting the sense strikes me as being better

than that of the standard text the tu shu has  

which i suppose would mean the man who heard the secret and the

man who told it to him
 


whether the object be to crush an army to storm a city or to

assassinate an individual it is always necessary to begin by finding

out the names of the attendants
 is a comprehensive term for those who wait on others servants

and retainers generally capt calthrop is hardly happy in

rendering it righthand men
the aidesdecamp
 literally visitors is equivalent as tu yu says to

 those whose duty it is to keep the general supplied with

information which naturally necessitates frequent interviews

with him chang y goes too far afield for an explanation in

saying that they are  the leaders of mercenary troops
the doorkeepers and sentries
 and 
of the general in command
 according to chang y is simply  a general on

active service capt calthrop is wrong i think in making 

directly dependent on   the names of the general in

charge etc
our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these
as the first step no doubt towards finding out if any of these

important functionaries can be won over by bribery capt calthrop

blunders badly with then set the spies to watch them

 
the enemys spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out
 is omitted by the tung tien and y lan its recurrence is

certainly suspicious though the sense may seem to gain by it the

tu shu has this variation   etc
tempted with bribes led away and comfortably housed
 is probably more than merely  or  detain cf   ad

fin where sun tz insists that these converted spies shall be

treated well chang ys paraphrase is 
thus they will become converted spies and available for our service
 
it is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are

able to acquire and employ local and inward spies
tu yu expands  into  through conversion of

the enemys spies we learn the enemys condition and chang y

says  we must tempt the

converted spy into our service because it is he that knows which

of the local inhabitants are greedy of gain and which of the

officials are open to corruption in the tung tien  has been

altered to  doubtless for the sake of uniformity with  
 
it is owing to his information again that we can cause the doomed

spy to carry false tidings to the enemy
because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best be

deceived chang y the tung tien text followed by the y

lan has here the obviously interpolated sentence 
 
lastly it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on

appointed occasions
capt calthrop omits this sentence

 
the end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of

the enemy
i have ventured to differ in this place from those commentatorstu

yu and chang ywho understand  as  and make  the

antecedent of  the others ignoring the point altogether it

is plausible enough that sun tz should require the ruler to be

familiar with the methods of spying though one would rather

expect  general in place of  but this involves taking 

here in quite a different way from the  immediately following

as also from those in the previous sentences  there refers

vaguely to the enemy or the enemys condition and in order to

retain the same meaning here i make  a verb governed by

 cf xi   where  is used in exactly the same

manner the sole objection that i can see in the way of this

interpretation is the fact that the  or fourth variety of spy

does not add to our knowledge of the enemy but only misinforms

the enemy about us this would be however but a trivial

oversight on sun tzs part inasmuch as the doomed spy is in

the strictest sense not to be reckoned as a spy at all capt

calthrop it is hardly necessary to remark slurs over the whole

difficulty
and this knowledge can only be derived in the first instance from

the converted spy
as explained in   he not only brings information himself

but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage
hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the

utmost liberality
 
of old the rise of the yin dynasty
sun tz means the  shang dynasty founded in  bc its name

was changed to yin by  pan kng in 
was due to i chih
better known as  i yin the famous general and statesman who

took part in chng tangs campaign against  chieh kuei

who had served under the hsia likewise the rise of the chou dynasty

was due to l ya
 l shang whose style was  rose to high office

under the tyrant  chou hsin whom he afterwards helped to

overthrow popularly known as  a title bestowed on him by wn

wang he is said to have composed a treatise on war erroneously

identified with the 
who had served under the yin
there is less precision in the chinese than i have thought it well to

introduce into my translation and the commentaries on the passage are

by no means explicit but having regard to the context we can hardly

doubt that sun tz is holding up i chih and l ya as illustrious

examples of the converted spy or something closely analogous his

suggestion is that the hsia and yin dynasties were upset owing to the

intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcomings which these

former ministers were able to impart to the other side mei yaochn

appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names i yin

and l ya he says were not rebels against the government

 hsia could not employ the former hence yin employed him

yin could not employ the latter hence chou employed him their great

achievements were all for the good of the people ho shih is also

indignant 

how should two divinely inspired men such as i and

l have acted as common spies sun tzs mention of them simply means

that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which

requires men of the highest mental calibre like i and l whose

wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task the above words only

emphasise this point ho shih believes then that the two heroes are

mentioned on account of their supposed skill in the use of spies but

this is very weak as it leaves totally unexplained the significant

words  and  capt calthrop speaks rather strangely of the

province of yin  the country of hsia  the state of chu  the

people of shang
 
hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will

use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying

chn hao compares    he points out that 

the godlike wisdom of chng tang and wu wang led them

to employ i yin and l shang the tu shu omits 
and thereby they achieve great results
tu mu closes with a note of warning



just as water which carries a boat from

bank to bank may also be the means of sinking it so reliance on

spies while productive of great results is ofttimes the cause

of utter destruction
spies are a most important element in war because on them depends an

armys ability to move
the antecedent to  must be either  or  understood from

the whole sentence chia lin says that an army without spies is

like a man without ears or eyes

pg pg 
 the book of war
 introduction
i
written in the fifth century bc suntzu

and wutzu still remain the most celebrated

works on war in the literature of china

while the chariot has gone and weapons

have changed these ancient masters have

held their own since they deal chiefly with

the fundamental principles of war with the

influence of politics and human nature on

military operations and they show in a

most striking way how unchanging these

principles are
when these books were written china

was a conglomerate of principalities in

continual ferment personal ambition andpg 

intrigue and not the wishes of the people

were the main factors in these wars

patriotism or a popular cause could not

therefore be relied on to maintain the

moral of the levies instead of these what

may be called the force of despair is pointed

out as the most powerful agent in giving

cohesion and energy to an army the

general is urged to take a vigorous offensive

and to act at a distance from his base

where defeat means disaster and where

desertion is minimised owing to the distance

from home he should in fact burn his

boats before an action or in chinese phrase

act as one who removes the ladder from

under those mounted upon the roof
on the other hand every care must be

taken not to render the enemy desperate

and as an instance of this sun observes

that an opponent should on no account

be completely surrounded a loophole of

escape weakens the resolution of the general

and the energy of his troops
it is interesting to notice that moral or

the spirit of the troops is thus consideredpg 

a determining factor in war the chinese

are perhaps unusually affected by climatic

conditions as is well known the umbrella

was part of a soldiers equipment and for

the same reasons the sunny side of high

ground is recommended as most suitable for

defence tactical considerations permitting
the large number of bannermen in the

chinese army was out of all proportion to

the service of standards in providing rallying

points the chief use of banners was to

maintain the spirit of the troops a forest

of banners held erect gave a feeling of

liveliness and security to the ranks in the

same way as a military band and when

sun remarks that the march of an army

should be calm like the forest he is using

a simile that is not inappropriate
probably owing to the fact that the

profession of arms has never been highly

regarded in china we find that the ruler

of the state did not usually take the field

but employed a professional to command

the armyone of the masters of war who

wandered from state to state at that timepg 

with the secrets of victory to impart to the

highest bidder the question of political

interference with the general in the field

naturally arises under these conditions

the two sages point out that to unite the

nation under firm and just government is

the business of the ruler and necessary to

victory but that the general is the best

judge of the questions that arise on a

distant field and that all interference with

him causes delay and disaster
war meaning ravage it was essential

that the operations should be conducted

in the enemys territory once there however

a vigorous offensive is no longer

advised at first behave with the discretion

of a maiden is the counsel of sun

the enemy must be induced to take the

initiative and when he is worn out by

marching or makes a false move then

says the master dart in like a rabbit
unlike the tactics of the japanese in

whom the spirit of attack burns so strongly

those of suntzu and wutzu are essentially

of the offensivedefensive ordermanuvrepg 

before fighting and noncommittal until the

enemy has shown his hand the business

of the general is to avoid encounter in

battle until the enemy is no longer capable

of offering a successful resistance
the masters do not make however the

mistake of advocating a passive defensive

suntzu lays down that the division of the

forces which this strategy involves is to

be everywhere weak rendering the army

liable to be taken in detail by the concentrated

forces of the enemy it is rather the

defence which avoids battle by mobility

and manuvre induces the enemy by

stratagem to divide his forces or act in

conformity with our wishes and then falls

upon him
with regard to the tactics of the battlefield

the pitched battle or in other words

the frontal attack is considered unworthy

of the skilful general the plan of attack

should consist broadly speaking in the

division of the army into two forces the

enemy is attracted and engaged by one

force and defeated with the other andpg 

here we have the containing or secondary

attack and the main or reserve force

which decides the battle of todaya

most striking instance of the continuity of

military principles
considerable space is devoted to the

influence of ground on war the passage

of defiles and rivers is still conducted in

the same way the many large rivers

of china naturally affected military operations

and among other axioms it is laid

down that the passage of a river should

not be disputed as the enemy will probably

give up the attempt and make the passage

untouched at some other point but that

he should be attacked when half his force

is across the stream again an army should

not encamp on a river below the enemy

as it is thereby liable to be inundated or to

have its water poisoned or the enemy may

come down stream and make a sudden

attack
while both writers were professional

soldiers they show a fine disinterestedness

by repeatedly pointing out that evenpg 

successful war brings evil in its train

wu remarks that few are those who have

gained power on earth by many victories

and he is insistent that war should not be

undertaken until a careful comparison of

the two sides shows that victory is certain

and he adds the army which conquers

makes certain of victory and then attacks

while the army that is defeated fights in

the hope of success
hence the importance they assign to

intelligence of the enemy and to the spy

and as the sages dealt with war between

members of the same race the work of

spies was greatly facilitated the spy was

treated with great honour by his countrymen

and the fact that many of the national

heroes of china were spies shows that the

part that they played was not forgotten

they frequently toiled for years and rose

to high rank in the enemys service and

thus by wrong counsel and by spreading

mistrust in his ranks they became a twoedged

sword in the hands of the general

wonderful indeed is their powerpg 

exclaims sun but he also reminds us that

their management is the most difficult and

delicate duty of the general
ii
sun and wu are perhaps held in even

greater reverence in japan than in china

where war is looked upon as a troublesome

phase in national life and victory in battle

is not considered the greatest achievement

of a state far otherwise is it in japan

and successive generations of her soldiers

have been brought up on sun and wu

like other arts mystery was formerly supposed

to surround the art of war a belief

that was encouraged by the strategist and

for a considerable time the few copies of

this book that were brought over from

china to japan were jealously guarded

by their possessors later as they became

known an army of japanese commentators

arosefor chinese literature is thought

compressed to be unfolded in the mind

of the reader
pg 
today sun and wu have given way to

the scientific works of european writers

but their sayings have become proverbs

and their influence undoubtedly helped the

japanese to victory in the late war belief

in the importance of a knowledge of the

enemy and his resources of preparation and

training had grown out of a long study

of these ancient masters and since it was

the vital importance of a successful issue

to the japanese which after all fired their

resolution and carried them through they

proved the sages words that it is the energy

born of despair that wins the victory
iii
little is known of the life of either

master they were in no sense patriots but

professional strategists continually changing

their employer chinese history tells a

famous story about sun a certain ruler

asked sun to give a practical demonstration

of his principles in the neighbourhood

of the palace and entrusted him withpg 

the women of the court for this purpose

during the operations the leader of one

of the sides did not obey the masters

instructions and her execution was ordered

she happened to be the kings favourite

wife but sun pointed out that the kings

wish that her life should be spared was

a case of political interference with the

general in the field and the sentence was

carried out
wu is represented as a person of low

moral character on two separate occasions

for fear of giving rise to suspicion he killed

one of his wives who belonged to a state

with which his employer at the time was

at war and graver still in the eyes of

the chinese historian he was not present

at the deathbed of his mother

preliminary reckoning
the words of sun the master
to all nations war is a great matter

upon the army death or life depend it is

the means of the existence or destruction

of the state
therefore it must be diligently studied
now in war besides stratagem and

the situation there are five indispensable

matters the first is called the way

the second heaven the third earth the

fourth the leader the fifth law
the way or the proper conduct of man

if the ruling authority be upright the

people are united fearless of danger their

lives are at the service of their lord
pg 
heaven yin and yang heat and

cold time and season
earth distance nature extent

strategic position
the leader intelligence truth benevolence

courage and strictness
law partition and ordering of troops
these things must be known by the

leader to know them is to conquer to

know them not is to be defeated
further with regard to these and the

following seven matters the condition of

the enemy must be compared with our own
the seven matters are
the virtue of the prince the ability

of the general natural advantages the

discipline of the armies the strength of

the soldiers training of the soldiers

justice both in reward and punishment
knowing these things i can foretell the

victor
pg 
if a general under me fight according

to my plans he always conquers and i

continue to employ him if he differ from

my plans he will be defeated and dismissed

from my service
wherefore with regard to the foregoing

considering that with us lies the advantage

and the generals agreeing we create a

situation which promises victory but as

the moment and method cannot be fixed

beforehand the plan must be modified

according to circumstances
war is a thing of pretence therefore

when capable of action we pretend disability

when near to the enemy we

pretend to be far when far away we

pretend to be near
allure the enemy by giving him a small

advantage confuse and capture him if

there be defects give an appearance of

perfection and awe the enemy pretend

to be strong and so cause the enemy to

avoid you make him angry and confuse

his plans pretend to be inferior and

cause him to despise you if he havepg 

superabundance of strength tire him out

if united make divisions in his camp

attack weak points and appear in unexpected

places
these are the secrets of the successful

strategist therefore they must not be made

known beforehand
at the reckoning in the sanctuary before

fighting victory is to the side that excels

in the foregoing matters they that have

many of these will conquer they that

have few will not conquer hopeless

indeed are they that have none
if the condition of both sides with regard

to these matters be known i can foretell

the victor

ii

operations of war
sun the master said
now the requirements of war are such

that we need a thousand light chariots with

four horses each a thousand leathercoveredpg 

chariots and one hundred thousand armoured

men and we must send supplies to distant

fields wherefore the cost at home and in

the field the entertainment of guests glue

and lacquer for repairs and necessities for

the upkeep of waggons and armour are such

that in one day a thousand pieces of gold

are spent with that amount a force of

one hundred thousand men can be raisedyou

have the instruments of victory
but even if victorious let the operations

long continue and the soldiers ardour decreases

the weapons become worn and if

a siege be undertaken strength disappears
again if the war last long the countrys

means do not suffice then when the

soldiers are worn out weapons blunted

strength gone and funds spent neighbouring

princes arise and attack that weakened

country at such a time the wisest man

cannot mend the matter
for while quick accomplishment has been

known to give the victory to the unskilful

the skilful general has never gained

advantage from lengthy operations
pg 
in fact there never has been a country

which has benefited from a prolonged war
he who does not know the evils of war

will not reap advantage thereby he who

is skilful in war does not make a second

levy does not load his supply waggons thrice
war material and arms we obtain from

home but food sufficient for the armys

needs can be taken from the enemy
the cost of supplying the army in distant

fields is the chief drain on the resources of

a state if the war be distant the citizens

are impoverished
in the neighbourhood of an army prices

are high and so the money of the soldiers

and followers is used up likewise the

state funds are exhausted and frequent

levies must be made the strength of the

army is dissipated money is spent the

citizens home swept bare in all seventenths

of his income is forfeited again

as regards state property chariots are

broken horses worn out armour and

helmet arrow and bow spear shield pike

and fighting tower waggon and oxen usedpg 

and gone so that sixtenths of the governments

income is spent
therefore the intelligent general strives

to feed on the enemy one bale of the

enemys rice counts as twenty from our

own waggons one bundle of the enemys

forage is better than twenty of our own
incitement must be given to vanquish

the enemy
they who take advantage of the enemy

should be rewarded
they who are the first to lay their hands

on more than ten of the enemys chariots

should be rewarded the enemys standard

on the chariots exchanged for our own the

captured chariots mixed with our own

chariots and taken into use
the accompanying warriors must be

treated well so that while the enemy is

beaten our side increases in strength
now the object of war is victory not

lengthy operations even skilfully conducted
the good general is the lord of the

peoples lives the guardian of the countrys

welfare

pg 
iii

the attack by stratagem
sun the master said
now by the laws of war better than

defeating a country by fire and the sword

is to take it without strife
better to capture the enemys army intact

than to overcome it after fierce resistance
better to capture the lu the tsu

or the wu whole than to destroy them

in battle
to fight and conquer one hundred times

is not the perfection of attainment for the

supreme art is to subdue the enemy without

fighting
wherefore the most skilful warrior outwits

the enemy by superior stratagem the

next in merit prevents the enemy from

uniting his forces next to him is he who

engages the enemys army while to besiege

his citadel is the worst expedient
pg 
a siege should not be undertaken if it

can possibly be avoided for before a

siege can be commenced three months are

required for the construction of stages

batteringrams and siege engines then a

further three months are required in front

of the citadel in order to make the

chuyin wherefore the general is

angered his patience exhausted his men

surge like ants against the ramparts before

the time is ripe and onethird of them are

killed to no purpose such are the misfortunes

that sieges entail
therefore the master of war causes the

enemys forces to yield but without fighting

he captures his fortress but without

besieging it and without lengthy fighting

takes the enemys kingdom without tarnishing

his weapons he gains the complete

advantage
this is the assault by stratagem
pg 
by the rules of war if ten times as strong

as the enemy surround him with five

times his strength attack with double his

numbers divide if equal in strength

exert to the utmost and fight if inferior

in numbers manuvre and await the opportunity

if altogether inferior offer no chance

of battle a determined stand by inferior

numbers does but lead to their capture
the warrior is the countrys support if

his aid be entire the country is of necessity

strong if it be at all deficient then is the

country weak
now a prince may embarrass his army in

three ways namely
ignorant that the army in the field should

not advance to order it to go forward or

ignorant that the army should not retreat

order it to retire
this is to tie the army as with a string
ignorant of military affairs to rule the

armies in the same way as the state
this is to perplex the soldiers
ignorant of the situation of the army to

settle its dispositions
pg 
this is to fill the soldiers with distrust
if the army be perplexed and distrustful

then dangers from neighbouring princes

arise the army is confounded and offered

up to the enemy
there are five occasions when victory can

be foretold
when the general knows the time to

fight and when not to fight or understands

when to employ large or small numbers

when government and people are of one

mind when the state is prepared and

chooses the enemys unguarded moment for

attack when the general possesses ability

and is not interfered with by his prince
these five things are the heralds of

victory
it has been said aforetime that he who

knows both sides has nothing to fear in a

hundred fights he who is ignorant of the

enemy and fixes his eyes only on his

own side conquers and the next time is

defeated he who not only is ignorant of

the enemy but also of his own resources

is invariably defeated

pg 
iv

the order of battle
sun the master said
the ancient masters of war first made

their armies invincible then waited until

the adversary could with certainty be

defeated
the causes of defeat come from within

victory is born in the enemys camp
skilful soldiers make defeat impossible

and further render the enemy incapable

of victory
but as it is written the conditions

necessary for victory may be present

but they cannot always be obtained
if victory be unattainable we stand

on the defensive if victory be sure we

attack
deficiency compels defence superabundance

permits attack
the skilful in defence crouch hiddenpg 

in the deepest shades the skilful in attack

push to the topmost heaven
if these precepts be observed victory is

certain
a victory even if popularly proclaimed

as such by the common folk may not be

a true success to win in fight and for

the kingdom to say well done does

not mark the summit of attainment to

lift an autumn fleece is no proof of

strength the eyes that only see the sun

and moon are not the eagles to hear the

thunder is no great thing
as has been said aforetime the able

warrior gains the victory without desperate

and bloody engagements and wins thereby

no reputation for wisdom or brave deeds

to fight is to win for he attacks only when

the enemy has sown the seeds of defeat
moreover the skilful soldier in a secure

position does not let pass the moment

when the enemy should be attacked
pg 
the army that conquers makes certain of

victory and then seeks battle
the army destined to defeat fights

trusting that chance may bring success to

its arms
the skilful leader is steadfast in the

way upholds the law and thereby

controls the issue
touching the laws of war it is said first

the rule second the measure third the

tables fourth the scales fifth the foretelling

of victory
for the rule is the survey of land the

measure tells the amount of that lands

produce the tables its population from

the scales their weight or quality is made

known and then can we calculate victory

or defeat
the army that conquers as against the

army destined to defeat is as a beam

against a feather in the scales the attack

of conquering forces is as the outburst of

longpentup waters into sunken valleys
such are the orders of battle

pg 
v

the spirit of the troops
sun the master said
the control of large numbers is possible

and like unto that of small numbers if we

subdivide them
by means of drum bell and flag the

direction of large forces in battle is possible

and like unto the direction of small forces
by the skilful interchange of normal and

abnormal manuvres are the armies certainly

preserved from defeat
the enemy is crushed like the fall of a

grindstone upon an egg by knowledge of

his strength and weakness and by the

employment of truth and artifice
moreover in battle the enemy is engagedpg 

with the normal and defeated by the

abnormal force
the abnormal force skilfully handled

is like the heaven and earth eternal

as the tides and the flow of rivers unceasing

like the sun and moon for ever

interchanging coming and passing as the

seasons
there are five notes but by combinations

innumerable harmonies are produced

there are but five colours but if we mix

them the shades are infinite there are

five tastes but if we mix them there

are more flavours than the palate can

distinguish
in war there are but two forces the

normal and the abnormal but they are

capable of infinite variation their mutual

interchange is like a wheel having neither

beginning or end they are a mystery

that none can penetrate
pg 
as the rush of rockshouldering torrents

so is the spirit of the troops
like the welljudged flight of the falcon

in a flash crushing its quarry so should the

stroke be timed
wherefore the spirit of the good fighter

is terrifying his occasions sudden like the

stretched crossbow whose string is released

at the touch of the trigger
in the maze and tumult of the battle

there is no confusion in the thick of action

the battle array is impenetrable
if discipline be perfect disorder can be

simulated if truly bold we can feign fear

if really strong we can feign weakness
we simulate disorder by subdivision

fear by spirit weakness by battle formation
we set the enemy in motion by adopting

different formations to which he must

conform
if we offer the enemy a point of

advantage he will certainly take it we

give him an advantage set him in motion

and then fall upon him
pg 
wherefore the good fighter seeks victory

from spirit and does not depend entirely

upon the skill of his men he is careful

in his choice and leaves the rest to battle

force yet when an opening or advantage

shows he pushes it to its limits
as a log or rock which motionless on

flat ground yet moves with everincreasing

force when set on an incline so await the

opportunity and so act when the opportunity

arrives
if the general be skilful the spirit of his

troops is as the impetus of a round stone

rolled from the top of a high mountain

vi

emptiness and strength
sun the master said
to be the first in the field and there to

await the enemy is to husband strength
to be late and hurrying to advance to

meet the foe is exhausting
pg 
the good fighter contrives to make the

enemy approach he does not allow himself

to be beguiled by the enemy
by offering an apparent advantage he

induces the enemy to take up a position

that will cause his defeat he plants obstructions

to dissuade him from acting in

such a way as to threaten his own dispositions
if the enemy be at rest in comfortable

quarters harass him if he be living in

plenty cut off his supplies if sitting

composedly awaiting attack cause him to

move
this may be done by appearing where

the enemy is not and assaulting unexpected

points
if we go where the enemy is not we may

go a thousand leagues without exhaustion
if we attack those positions which the

enemy has not defended we invariably take

them but on the defence we must be

strong even where we are not likely to

be attacked
against those skilful in attack the enemypg 

does not know where to defend against

those skilful in defence the enemy does

not know where to attack
now the secrets of the art of offence are

not to be easily apprehended as a certain

shape or noise can be understood of the

senses but when these secrets are once

learnt the enemy is mastered
we attack and the enemy cannot resist

because we attack his insufficiency we

retire and the enemy cannot pursue

because we retire too quickly
again when we are anxious to fight but

the enemy is serenely secure behind high

walls and deep moats we attack some

such other place that he must certainly

come out to relieve
when we do not want to fight we

occupy an unfortified line and prevent the

enemy from attacking by keeping him in

suspense
by making feints and causing the enemy

to be uncertain as to our movements we

unite whilst he must divide
we become one body the enemy beingpg 

separated into ten parts we attack the

divided ten with the united one we are

many the enemy is few and in superiority

of numbers there is economy of strength
the place selected for attack must be

kept secret if the enemy know not

where he will be attacked he must prepare

in every quarter and so be everywhere

weak
if the enemy strengthen his front he

must weaken his rear if he strengthen

his right his left is weakened and if he

strengthen his left his right is weakened
everywhere to make preparations is to be

everywhere weak the enemy is weakened

by his extended preparations and we gain

in strength
having decided on the place and day

of attack though the enemy be a hundred

leagues away we can defeat him
if the ground and occasion be not known

the front cannot help the rear the left

cannot support the right nor the right the

left nor the rear the front for on occasion

the parts of the army are two scorepg 

leagues apart while a distance of four or

five leagues is comparatively close
the soldiers of wu are less than the

soldiers of yueh but as superiority in

numbers does not of necessity bring victory

i say then that we may obtain the victory
if the enemy be many in number prevent

him from taking advantage of his

superiority and ascertain his plan of operations

provoke the enemy and discover

the state of his troops feint and discover

the strength of his position flap the

wings and unmask his sufficiency or insufficiency

by constant feints and excursions

we may produce on the enemy an

impression of intangibility which neither

spies nor art can dispel
the general makes his plans in accordance

with the dispositions of the enemy

and puts his hosts in motion but the

multitude cannot appreciate the generals

intention they see the signs of victory but

they cannot discover the means
pg 
if a victory be gained by a certain

stratagem do not repeat it vary the

stratagem according to circumstances
an army may be likened to water
water leaves dry the high places and

seeks the hollows an army turns from

strength and attacks emptiness
the flow of water is regulated by the

shape of the ground victory is gained by

acting in accordance with the state of the

enemy
the shape of water is indeterminate

likewise the spirit of war is not fixed
the leader who changes his tactics in

accordance with his adversary and thereby

controls the issue may be called the god

of war
among the five elements there is no

settled precedence the four seasons come

and go the days are long and short and

the moon waxes and wanes so in war

there is no fixity

pg 
vii

battle tactics
sun the master said
for the most part military procedure

is as follows
the general receives orders from his

lord assembles and settles harmony

among the forces and takes the field
there is nothing more difficult than

battle tactics their difficulty lies in the

calculation of time and distance and the

reversal of misfortune
to make the enemy take a circuitous

route by a show of gain and then whilst

starting after him to arrive before him is

to be a master of the art of manuvre
the operations of an army may reap

advantage the wrangles of a multitude

are fraught with peril
employing our whole force at one time

in order to gain advantage over the enemypg 

we may not have time enough to gain our

object if we push on with a portion of the

force only the transport is lost discarding

helmet and armour stopping neither day

nor night marching double distance doing

double work and finally contending with

the enemy at a distance of a hundred

leagues results in the loss of the general

since the strong men arrive first and the

tired drop in rear only onetenth of the

forces is available
a forced march of fifty leagues to secure

an advantage may result in failure to the

leader of the vanguard for only half his

men will arrive
after a forced march of thirty leagues

to secure an advantage only twothirds of

the army will be available
further a lack of ammunition of supplies

or of stores may lead to disaster
the ruler who is ignorant of the designs

of neighbouring princes cannot treat with

them
he who is ignorant of mountain and

forest defile and marsh cannot lead an army
pg 
he who does not employ a guide cannot

gain advantage from the ground
disguise your movements await a favourable

opportunity divide or unite according

to circumstance
let your attack be swift as the wind

your march calm like the forest your

occupation devastating as fire in defence

as a mountain rest firm like darkness impenetrable

to the enemy let your movements

be swift as the lightning
let as many as possible take part in the

plunder distribute the profit from the

captured territory
so he who understands the crooked and

the straight way conquers
these are the methods of battle tactics
according to the ancient books on war

the drum and bell are used because the

voice does not carry the flag is used to

assist the sight the use of bell drum

banner and flag is to attract the united

attention of eye and ear
pg 
when all are united the strong are not

left to go forward alone the cowardly are

not free to retreat unrestricted in this

way can a multitude be used
therefore in night fighting beacons and

drums are largely used in day fighting a

great number of banners and flags and the

enemys eyes and ears are confounded
we thus awe his army and defeat his

generals ambition
in the morning the spirits are keen at

midday there is a laziness in the evening

a desire to return wherefore he who

uses his soldiers well avoids the time when

the spirits are keen but attacks the enemy

when he is languid or seeking his camp
thus should the nature of energy be

turned to account
to oppose confusion with order clamour

with quiet is to have the heart under

control
to await an enemy from a distance to

oppose hunger with satiety rest with fatigue

is the way to husband strength
do not attack where lines of bannerspg 

wave nor the serried ranks of battle spread

but patiently await your time
do not attack an enemy on high ground

nor one who has high ground at his back

do not pursue an enemy who is imitating

flight do not attack a spirited enemy
if the enemy offer an allurement do

not take it
do not interfere with an enemy who has

struck camp and is about to retire when

surrounding an enemy allow him an outlet

do not press a desperate enemy
these are the methods of employing troops

viii

the nine changes
sun the master said
in general the procedure of war isthe

leader having received orders from

his lord assembles the armies
do not camp on marshy or lowlying

ground enter into friendly relations with

neighbouring states do not linger in a farpg 

country use stratagem in mountainous and

wooded country on death ground fight
there are always roads that must be

avoided forces that must not be attacked

castles that must not be besieged ground

that must not be chosen for encounter

orders from the lord that must not be

obeyed
the general who knows the nine changes

understands the use of troops on the contrary

he who does not understand them can

make no use of his topographical knowledge
in the management of armies if the art

of the nine changes be understood a knowledge

of the five advantages is of no avail
the wise man considers well both advantage

and disadvantage he sees a way out

of adversity and on the day of victory to

danger is not blind
in reducing an enemy to submission

inflict all possible damage upon him make

him undertake useless adventures also

make neighbouring rulers move as you

would desire them by tempting them with

gain
pg 
wherefore in the conduct of war do not

depend on the enemys not coming but

rely on your own preparations do not

count on the enemy not attacking your

fortress but leave nothing undefended
generals must be on their guard against

these five dangerous faults
blind impetuosity which leads to death
overcautiousness which leads to capture
quick temper which brings insult
a too rigid propriety which invites disgrace
overregard for the troops which causes

inconvenience
these five faults in the leader are disastrous

in war the overthrow of the army

and the slaughter of the general arise from

them therefore they must be carefully

considered

pg 
ix

movement of troops
sun the master said
touching the disposal of troops and

observation of the enemy in relation to

mountain warfare
cross mountains and camp in valleys

selecting positions of safety
place the army on high ground and avoid

an enemy in high places
in relation to water
after crossing waters pass on immediately

to a distance when the enemy is crossing

a stream do not meet and engage him in

the waters but strike when half his force

has passed over do not advance on an

enemy near water but place the army on

high ground and in safety
do not fight when the enemy is between

the army and the source of the river
pg 
with regard to marshes
cross salty marshes quickly do not linger

near them
if by chance compelled to fight in the

neighbourhood of a marsh seek a place

where there is water and grass and trees in

plenty in the rear
in open country place the army in a convenient

place with rising ground in the right

rear so that while in front lies death behind

there is safety
such is war in flat country
huangti by observing these things gained

the victory over four princes
as a rule the soldiers prefer high ground

to low they prefer sunny places to those

the sun does not reach
if the health of the troops be considered

and they are encamped on high and sunny

ground diseases will be avoided and victory

made certain
if there be rising ground encamp on its

sunny side and in front of it for thereby

the soldiers are benefited and the ground

used to our advantage
pg 
if owing to rains in the upper reaches

the river become turbulent do not cross

until the waters have quieted
steep and impassable valleys welllike

places confined places tangled impenetrable

ground swamps and bogs narrow

passages with pitfallsquickly pass from

these and approach them not cause the

enemy to approach near to them but

keep yourself from these places face

them so that the enemy has them in his

rear
if there be near to the army precipices

ponds meres reeds and rushes or thick

forests and trees search them thoroughly

these are places where the enemy is likely

to be in ambush
when the enemy is close but quiet he is

strong in reliance on natural defences
if the enemy challenge to fight from afar

he wishes you to advance
if the enemy be encamped in open

country it is with some special object in

view
movement among the trees shows thatpg 

the enemy is advancing broken branches

and trodden grass as of the passing of a

large host must be regarded with suspicion
the rising of birds shows an ambush
startled beasts show that the enemy is

stealthily approaching from several sides
high straight spurts of dust betoken

that chariots are coming
long low masses of dust show the

coming of infantry
here and there thin and high columns

of dust are signs that firewood and fodder

are being collected
small clouds of dust moving to and fro

are signs that the enemy is preparing to

encamp for a short time
busy preparations and smooth words

show that the enemy is about to advance

to attack
big words and the spurring forward of

horsemen are signs that the enemy is about

to retire
an advance of the light chariots to the

flanks of the camp is a sign that the enemy

is coming forth to fight
pg 
without consultation suddenly to desire

an armistice is a mark of ulterior design
the passing to and fro of messengers

and the forming up of troops show that the

enemy has some movement on foot
an advance followed by sudden retirement

is a lure to attack
when the enemy use their weapons to

rest upon they are hungry
if the drawers of water drink at the river

the enemy is suffering from thirst
disregard of booty that lies ready at hand

is a sign of exhaustion
the clustering of birds round a position

shows that it is unoccupied
voices calling in the night betoken alarm
disorder in the army is a sign that the

general is disregarded
a changing about of flags and banners

is a sign that the army is unsettled
if the officers be angry it is because the

soldiers are tired and slow to obey
the killing of horses for food shows that

the enemy is short of provisions
when the cookingpots are hung up onpg 

the wall and the soldiers turn not in again

the enemy is at an end of his resources
exceeding graciousness and familiarity

on the part of the general show that he

has lost the confidence of the soldiers
frequent rewards show that discipline is

at an end
frequent punishments are a sign that the

general is in difficulties
the general who first blusters and then

is obsequious is without perception
he who offers apologies and hostages

is anxious for a truce
when both sides eager for a fight face

each other for a considerable time neither

advancing nor retiring the occasion requires

the utmost vigilance and circumspection
numbers are no certain mark of strength
even if incapable of a headlong assault

if the forces be united and the enemys

condition ascertained victory is possible
he who without taking thought makes

light of the enemy is certain to be captured
if a general who is strange to the troops

punish them they cease to obey him ifpg 

they are not obedient they cannot be

usefully employed
if the troops know the general but are not

affected by his punishments they are useless
by humane treatment we obtain obedience

authority brings uniformity thus

we obtain victory
if the people have been trained in obedience

from the beginning they respect their

leaders commands
if the people be not early trained to

obedience they do not respect their leaders

commands
orders are always obeyed if general and

soldiers are in sympathy

x

ground
sun the master said
with regard to the different natures of

ground there are
open ground broken ground suspended

ground defiles precipices far countries
open ground is that where either side haspg 

liberty of movement be quick to occupy

any high ground in the neighbourhood and

consider well the line of supplies
broken ground advance is easy but

retreat from it is difficult here if the

enemy be not prepared we may win but

should he be prepared and defeat us and

retreat be impossible then there is disaster
suspended ground the side that takes

the initiative is under a disadvantage

here if the enemy offer some allurement

we should not advance but rather by

feigning retreat wait until he has put forth

half his force then we may attack him

with advantage
defiles make haste to occupy garrison

strongly and await the enemy should the

enemy be before you and in strength do

not engage him but if there be unoccupied

points attack him
in precipitous ground quickly occupy

a position on a sunny height and await

the enemy if the enemy be before you

withdraw and do not attack him
if distant from the enemy and the forcespg 

be equal to take the initiative is disadvantageous
now these are the six kinds of ground

it is the duty of generals to study them
again there are six calamities among the

troops arising not from defect of ground or

lack of opportunity but from the generals

incapacity
these are repulse relaxation distress

disorganisation confusion and rout
if troops be sent to attack an enemy of

equal quality but ten times their number

they retire discomfited
strong soldiers with weak officers cause

relaxation
able officers with feeble soldiers cause

distress
enraged senior officers who fall upon the

enemy without orders and obey not the

general because he does not recognise their

abilities produce disorganisation
weak and amiable generals whose directions

and leadership are vague whose

officers and mens duties are not fixed

and whose dispositions are contradictory

produce confusion
pg 
generals who are unable to estimate the

enemy who oppose small numbers to large

weakness to strength and who do not put

picked men in the van of the army cause

it to be routed
these six things lead to defeat it is the

duty of the general to study them carefully
ground is the handmaid of victory
ability to estimate the enemy and plan

the victory an eye for steepness command

and distances these are the qualities of the

good general
whosoever knows these things conquers

he who understands them not is defeated
if victory be certain from the military

standpoint fight even if the lord forbid
if defeat be certain from the military

standpoint do not fight even though the

lord commands it
the general who advances from no

thought of his own glory or retires regardless

of punishment but only strives for

the peoples welfare and his lords advantage

is a treasure to the state
the good general cares for his soldierspg 

and lovingly treats them as his children

as a consequence they follow him through

deep valleys and are beside him in death
nevertheless overcare for the soldiers

may cause disobedience overattention may

make them unserviceable overindulgence

may produce disorder they become like

spoilt children and cannot be used
he who is confident of his own men but

is ignorant that the enemy should not be

attacked has no certainty of victory
he who knows that the enemy may be

attacked with advantage but knows not

his own men has no certainty of victory
confidence in the troops right judgment

when to attack the enemy but ignorance

of the ground bring uncertain victory
the wise soldier once in motion does

not waver and is never at a loss
as has been said know thyself know

the enemy fear not for victory
also if the season and the opportunity

be realised and the ground known complete

victory is certain

pg 
xi

the nine grounds
sun the master said
in respect to the conduct of war there

are
distracting ground disturbing ground

ground of contention intersecting ground

pathridden ground deeplyinvolved ground

difficult ground enclosed ground death

ground
at all times when the prince fights in his

own territory it is called distracting ground
that ground a short way inside the enemys

border is called disturbing ground
ground giving advantage to whichever

side is in possession is called ground of

contention
ground to which either side has access

is called intersecting ground
ground between three provinces firstpg 

possession of which enables the peoples of

the earth to be controlled is called pathridden

ground
the interior of the enemys country with

many of his fortified towns in rear is called

deeplyinvolved ground
mountain and forest precipices ravines

marsh and swamp all places where passage

is hard are called difficult ground
a narrow entrance and winding outlet

where a small number can oppose a large

force is called enclosed ground
that ground where delay means disaster

is called death ground
wherefore do not fight on distracting

ground do not linger on disturbing ground
if the enemy be in possession of disputed

ground do not attack
in intersecting ground do not interrupt

the highways
at the crossing of highways cultivate

intercourse
when deeply involved levy and store

up the enemys property
quickly depart from difficult ground
pg 
on enclosed ground use stratagem
on death ground fight
the skilful fighters of old were at pains

to disconnect the enemys front and rear

they cut asunder small and large forces of

the enemy prevented mutual help between

his officers and men spread mistrust

between high and low they scattered the

enemy and prevented him from concentrating

if his soldiers were assembled they

were without unity
if there be a chance of victory move if

there be no chance of success stand fast
if i were asked how a powerful and

united force of the enemy should be met

i would say lay hands on what the enemy

cherishes and he will conform to our desires
in war above all speed sustains the

spirit of the troops strike before the

enemy is ready and attack his unpreparedness

from an unexpected quarter
with regard to war in foreign lands

when strangers in a far country the soldiers

are united and are proof against defeat

plunder fertile plains so that the army ispg 

fed be careful of the health of the soldiers

do not tire them uselessly unite their

minds store up strength plan well and

secretly if there be no refuge the soldiers

will not fly from death
if there be no alternative but death the

soldiers exert themselves to the utmost
in desperate places soldiers lose the sense

of fear
if there be no place of refuge there

will be no wavering
if deeply involved in the enemys country

there is unity
if it be unavoidable the soldiers will

fight their hardest even without warnings

they are vigilant they comply without

insistence without stipulations they are

tractable without explicit instructions they

will trust the general and obey him
prohibit the discussion of signs and

omens and remove the soldiers doubts

then to the moment of death they will be

undistracted
riches are denied the soldiers not because

money is a bad thing old age is forbiddenpg 

them but not because long life is evil

hardships and danger are the proper lot

of the soldier
when the order for attack is given the

collars of those who are sitting may be wet

with tears tears may roll down the cheeks

of those reclining yet these men in a

desperate place will fight with the courage

of chu and kuei
soldiers should be used like the snakes on

mt chang which if you hit on the head

the tail will strike you if you hit the tail

the head will strike you if you strike its

middle head and tail will strike you

together
should any one ask me whether men

can be made to move like these snakes

i say yes the men of wu and yueh

hate each other yet if they cross a river

in the same boat and a storm overtake

them they help each other like the two

hands
the horses may be tied and the chariot

wheels sunk in the mud but that does not

prevent flight
pg 
universal courage and unity depend on

good management
the best results from both the weak and

strong are obtained by a proper use of the

ground
the skilful warrior can lead his army as

a man leads another by the hand because

he places it in a desperate position
the general should be calm inscrutable

just and prudent he should keep his

officers and men in ignorance of his plans

and inform no one of any changes or fresh

departures by changing his camps and

taking devious and unexpected routes his

plans cannot be guessed
as one taking away the ladder from under

those mounted upon the roof so acts the

general when his men are assembled to fight

he penetrates into the heart of the enemys

country and then divulges his plans he

drives the army hither and thither like a

flock of sheep knowing not whither they go
therefore the general should assemble

the armies and place them in a desperate

position
pg 
the different natures of the nine grounds

the suiting of the means to the occasion

the hearts of men these are things that

must be studied
when deep in the interior of a hostile

country there is cohesion if only on the

borders there is distraction to leave home

and cross the borders is to be free from

interference
on distracting ground unite the soldiers

minds
on disturbing ground keep together
on disputed ground try to take the

enemy in rear
on intersecting ground look well to the

defences
on pathridden ground cultivate intercourse
on deeplyinvolved ground be careful

of supplies
on difficult ground do not linger
on enclosed ground close the path of

escape
on death ground show the soldiers that

there is no chance of survival
pg 
it is the nature of soldiers to defend when

surrounded to fight with energy when compelled

thereto to pursue the enemy if he

retreat
he cannot treat with other rulers who

knows not their ambitions
he who knows not mountain and forest

cliffs ravines lakes and marshes cannot

conduct an army
he who does not use guides cannot take

advantage of the ground
he who has not a complete knowledge

of the nine grounds cannot gain military

dominion
the great general when attacking a

powerful nation prevents the enemy from

concentrating his hosts
he overawes the enemy so that other

states cannot join against him
he does not struggle for the favour of

other states nor is he careful of their

rights he has confidence in himself and

awes the enemy
therefore he easily takes the fortress or

reduces the country to subjection
pg 
in the bestowal of rewards or in

his orders he is not bound by ancient

rule
he manages his forces as though they

were one man
orders should direct the soldiers but

while what is advantageous should be made

known what is disadvantageous should be

concealed
if the forces be plunged into danger

there is survival from death ground there

is retrieval for the force in danger gains

the victory
discover the enemys intentions by conforming

to his movements when these

are discovered then with one stroke the

general may be killed even though he

be one hundred leagues distant
when war is declared close the barriers

destroy passports prevent the passage of

the enemys spies conduct the business

of the government with vigilance
take immediate advantage of the enemys

weakness discover what he most values

and plan to seize it
pg 
shape your plans according to rule and

the circumstances of the enemy
at first behave with the discretion of a

maiden then when the enemy gives an

opening dart in like a rabbit
the enemy cannot defend himself

assault by fire
sun the master said
there are five ways of attack by fire
the first is called barrack burning the

second commissariat burning the third

equipment burning the fourth store burning

the fifth the company burning
the moment for the fire assault must

be suitable further appliances must

always be kept at hand
there is a time and day proper for the

setting and carrying out of the fire assault

namely such time as the weather is dry

and a day when the moon is in the quarterspg 

of the stars chi pi i chen for these

are days of wind
regard well the developments that will

certainly arise from the fire and act upon

them when fire breaks out inside the

enemys camp thrust upon him with all

speed from without but if his soldiers be

quiet wait and do not attack
when the fire is at its height attack or

not as opportunity may arise
if the opportunity be favourable set fire

to the enemys camp and do not wait for

it to break out from within
when fire breaks out on the windward

side do not attack from the leeward
wind that rises in the day lasts long

wind that rises in the night time quickly

passes away
the peculiarities of the five burnings

must be known and the calendar studied

and if the attack is to be assisted the fire

must be unquenchable
if water is to assist the attack the flood

must be overwhelming
water may isolate or divide the enemypg 

fire may consume his camp but unless

victory or possession be obtained the enemy

quickly recovers and misfortunes arise the

war drags on and money is spent
let the enlightened lord consider well

and the good general keep the main object

in view if no advantage is to be gained

thereby do not move without prospect of

victory do not use the soldiers do not

fight unless the state be in danger
war should not be undertaken because

the lord is in a moment of passion the

general must not fight because there is

anger in his heart
do not make war unless victory may be

gained thereby if there be prospect of

victory move if there be no prospect

do not move
for passion may change to gladness

anger passes away but a country once

overturned cannot be restored the dead

cannot be brought to life
wherefore it is written the enlightened

lord is circumspect and the good general

takes heed then is the state secure and

the army victorious in battle

pg

the employment of spies
sun the master said
calling  men to arms and transporting

them a hundred leagues is such

an undertaking that in one day  taels

of the citizens and nobles money are spent

commotions arise within and without the

state carriers fall down exhausted on the

line of march of the army and the occupations

of  homes are upset
again for years the armies may face each

other yet the issue may depend on a

single days victory
wherefore by grudging slight expense

in titles and salaries to spies to remain in

ignorance of the enemys circumstances ispg 

to be without humanity such a person

is no general he is no assistance to his

lord he is no master of victory
the enlightened ruler and the wise

general who act win and are distinguished

beyond the common are informed beforehand
this knowledge is not to be got by calling

on gods and demons nor does it come

of past experience nor calculation it is

through men that knowledge of the enemy

is gained
now the five kinds of spies are these

village spies inner spies converted spies

death spies living spies
if these five means be employed simultaneously

none can discover their working

this is called the mysterious thread it is

the lords treasure
village spies are such people of the

country as give information
inner spies are those of the enemys

officials employed by us
converted spies are those of the enemys

spies in our pay
pg 
death spies are sent to misinform the

enemy and to spread false reports through

our spies already in the enemys lines
living spies return to report
in connection with the armies spies

should be treated with the greatest kindness

and in dealing out reward they

should receive the most generous treatment

all matters relating to spies are secret
without infinite capacity in the general

the employment of spies is impossible

their treatment requires benevolence and

uprightness except they be observed with

the closest attention the truth will not be

obtained from them
wonderful indeed is the power of spies
there is no occasion when they cannot

be used
if a secret matter be spoken of before

the time is ripe the spy who told the

matter and the man who repeated the

same should be put to death
pg 
if desirous of attacking an army of

besieging a fortress or of killing a certain

person first of all learn the names of the

general in charge of his righthand men

of those who introduce visitors to the

presence of the gate keeper and the

sentries then set the spies to watch them
seek out the enemys spies who come to

spy on us give them money cause them

to be lodged and cared for and convert

them to the service through them we

are enabled to obtain spies among the

enemys villagers and officials
by means of the converted spy we can

construct a false story for the death spy

to carry to the enemy
it is through the converted spy that we

are able to use the five varieties to their

utmost advantage therefore he must be

liberally treated
in ancient times the rise to power of

the province of yin was due to ichih

who was sent to the country of hsiapg 

likewise during the foundation of the state

of chu luya lived among the people of

shang
wherefore intelligent rulers and wise

generals use the cleverest men as spies

and invariably acquire great merit the

spy is a necessity to the army upon him

the movement of the army depends

pg 
 the sayings of wutzu
 introduction
now wu albeit clothed in the raiment

of a scholar was a man skilled in the art

of war
and wen lord of wei came unto

him and said
i am a man of peace caring not for

military affairs
and wu said
your actions are witnesses of your

mind why do your words say not what is

in your heart
you do prepare and dress hides and

leather through the four seasons ornamenting

them with red lacquer and the figures

of panthers and elephants which give not

warmth in winter neither in summer

coolness moreover you make halberdspg 

 feet long and pikes  feet long and

leather covered chariots so large as to fill

up the gateways wheels with ornament

and naves capped with leather now these

are neither beautiful to the eye nor light

in the chase i know not for what use

my lord makes these things
but although provided with these

instruments of war if the leader be not

competent a brooding hen might as well

strike a badger or a dog with young challenge

the tiger the spirit of encounter may

be present but there is no end but death
in ancient times the prince chengsang

cultivated virtue and put away military

things and his kingdom fell
the prince yuhu put his trust in

numbers and delighted in war and was

driven from the throne
therefore the enlightened ruler should

ponder over these things encourage learning

and virtue in the kingdom and be prepared

against war from without
pg 
to hesitate before the enemy is not a

cause for righteousness remorse for the

fallen is not true humanity
and when lord wen heard these words

he himself spread a seat and his wife

offered up a cup and wu was appointed

general before the altar
now in the defence of hsihe against

different states there were fought seventysix

great fights of which sixtyfour were complete

victories and the remainder undecided

and the kingdom grew and stretched 

leagues on every side which was all due

to the virtue of wu

i

the government of a country
and wu the master said
the mighty rulers of old first trained

their retainers and then extended their

regard to their outlying feudatories
there are four discords
pg 
discord in the state then never make war
discord in the army then do not strike

camp
discord in the camp then do not advance

to attack
discord in the battle array then seek

not to decide the issue
therefore wise rulers who would employ

their subjects in great endeavours should

first establish harmony among them
lend not a ready ear to human counsellors

but lay the matter before the altar seek

inside the turtle and consider well the

time and season then if all be well

commit ourselves to the undertaking
if the people know that their lord is careful

of their lives and laments their death

beyond all else then in the time of danger

the soldiers advance and advancing find

glory in death and in survival after retreat

dishonour
the master said
the way must follow the only truepg 

path righteousness lies at the root of

achievement and merit
the object of stratagem is to avoid loss

and gain advantage
the object of government is to guard

enterprise and to preserve the state
if conduct depart from the way and

the undertaking accord not with righteousness

then disaster befalls the mighty
therefore wise men maintain order by

keeping in the way and governing with

righteousness they move with discretion

and with benevolence they make the people

amenable
if these four virtues be practised there

is prosperity if they be neglected there

is decay
for when lord tang of cheng defeated

lord chieh the people of hsia rejoiced

and when wu of chou defeated lord

chou the people of yin were not discomfited

and this was because it was

ordained by providence and human desire
the master said
in the government of a country andpg 

command of an army the inculcation of

propriety stimulation of righteousness and

the promotion of a sense of shame are

required
when men possess a sense of shame

they will attack with resolution when in

strength and when few in number defend

to the last
but while victory is easy in attack it

is difficult in defence
now of the fighting races below heaven

those who gained five victories have been

worn out those who have won four victories

have been impoverished three victories

have given dominion two victories have

founded a kingdom and upon one victory

an empire has been established
for those who have gained power on

earth by many victories are few and those

who have lost it many
the master said
the causes of war are five
first ambition second profit third

overburdened hate fourth internal disorder

fifth famine
pg 
again the natures of war are five
first a righteous war second a war of

might third a war of revenge fourth a

war of tyranny fifth an unrighteous war
the prevention of tyranny and the restoration

of order is just to strike in reliance

on numbers is oppression to raise the

standard for reasons of anger is a war of

revenge to quit propriety and seize advantage

is tyranny when the state is disordered

and the people worn out to harbour

designs and set a multitude in motion is

a war of unrighteousness
there is a way of overcoming each of

these five
righteousness is overcome by propriety

might by humanity revenge by words

tyranny by deception unrighteousness by

strategy
lord wen asked and said
i would know the way to control an

army to measure men and make the

country strong
wu answered and said
the enlightened rulers of antiquitypg 

respected propriety between sovereign and

people established etiquette between high

and low settled officials and citizens in close

accord gave instruction in accordance with

custom selected men of ability and thereby

provided against what should come to pass
in ancient times prince huan of chi

assembled  men at arms and became

chief among the princes prince wen of

chin put  mighty men in the van

and gained his ambition prince mu of

chin gathered together  invincibles

and subdued his neighbouring foes wherefore

the princes of powerful states must

consider their people and assemble the

valiant and spirited men by companies
those who delight to attack and to

display their valour and fealty should be

formed in companies
those skilful in scaling heights or

covering long distances and who are quick

and light of foot must be collected in

companies
retainers who have lost their rank and

who are desirous of displaying their prowesspg 

before their superiors should be gathered

into companies
those who have abandoned a castle or

deserted their trust and are desirous of

atoning for their misconduct should be

collected and formed into companies
these five bodies form the flower of the

army with  of such troops if they

issue from within an encompassing enemy

can be burst asunder if they enter from

without a castle can be overthrown
lord wen asked and said
i desire to know how to fix the battle

array render defence secure and attack

with certainty of victory
wu answered and said
to see with the eye is better than ready

words yet i say if the wise men be put

in authority and the ignorant in low places

then the army is already arranged
if the people be free from anxiety

about their estates and love their officials

then defence is already secure
if all the lieges be proud of their lord

and think ill of neighbouring states then

is the battle already won
pg 
the lord wen once assembled a number

of his subjects to discuss affairs of state

and none could equal him in wisdom and

when he left the council chamber his face

was pleased
then wu advanced and said
in ancient times lord chuang of chu

once consulted with his lieges and none were

like unto him in wisdom and when the

lord left the council chamber his countenance

was troubled then the duke shen

asked and said why is my lord

troubled and he answered i have

heard that the world is never without sages

and that in every country there are wise

men that good advisers are the foundation

of an empire and friends of dominion

now if i lacking wisdom have no equal

among the multitude of my officers dangerous

indeed is the state of chu it grieves

me that whereas prince chuang of chu

was troubled in a like case my lord should

be pleased
and hearing this lord wen was inwardly

troubled

pg 
ii

estimation of the enemy
and lord wen said to wu
chin threatens us on the west chu

surrounds us on the south chao presses

us in the north chi watches us in the

east yen stops our rear and han is

posted in our front thus the armies of

six nations encompass us on every side and

our condition is very unpropitious canst

thou relieve my anxiety
wu answered and said
the path of safety of a state lies first

of all in vigilance now my lord has

already taken warning wherefore misfortunes

are yet distant
let me state the habits of these six

countries the forces of chi are weighty

but without solidity the soldiers of chin

are scattered and fight each of his own

accord the army of chu is well ordered

but cannot endure the soldiers of yenpg 

defend well but are without dash the

armies of the three chins are well governed

but cannot be used
the nature of chi is stubborn and the

country rich but prince and officials are

proud and luxurious and neglectful of the

common people government is loose and

rewards not impartial in one camp there

are two minds the front is heavy but the

rear is light therefore it is ponderous

without stability to attack it the force

must be divided into three parts and by

threatening it on three sides its front can

be broken
the nature of chin is strong the

country rugged and the government firm

rewards and punishments just the people

indomitable and all have the fighting

spirit wherefore when separated each

fights of his own accord
to defeat this people they must first

be tempted by gain to leave their cause

so that the soldiers greedy of profit desert

their general then taking advantage of

their disobedience their scattered forcespg 

can be chased ambushes laid favourable

opportunities taken and their general

captured
the nature of chu is weak its territory

wide the government weak and the people

exhausted the troops are well ordered but

of short endurance
the way to defeat them is to assault

their camp throw it into confusion and

crush their spirit advance softly and retire

quickly tire them out avoid a serious

encounter and they may be defeated
the nature of yen is straightforward

its people are cautious loving courage and

righteousness and without guile wherefore

they defend but are not daring
the way to defeat them is to draw

close and press them tease them and pass

to a distance move quickly and appear in

the rear thus causing bewilderment to their

officers and fear in their ranks our chariots

and horsemen will act with circumspection

and avoid encounter thus their general

can be captured
the three chins are the middle kingpg dom

their nature is peaceful and their

rule just their people are tired of war

their troops are trained but their leaders

are despised pay is small and the soldiers

lack the spirit of sacrifice thus they are well

governed but cannot be used
the way to defeat them is to threaten

them from afar if a multitude attackdefend

if they retreatpursue and tire

them out
in every army there are mighty warriors

with strength to lift the censer swifter

of foot than the war horse who can take

the enemys standard or slay his general

if such men be selected and set apart

cared for and honoured they are the life

of the army
those who use the five arms with skill

who are clever strong and quick and careless

of the enemy should be given rank

and decoration and used to decide the

victory their parents and families should

be cared for encouraged by rewards and

kept in fear of punishment these menpg 

consolidate the battle array their presence

causes endurance
if these men be well selected double

their number can be defeated
and lord wen said
it is good
wu the master said
in the estimation of the enemy there

are eight cases when without consulting

the oracles he may be attacked
first an enemy who in great wind and

cold has risen early started forth across ice

and rivers and braved stress and hardships
second an enemy who in the height of

summer and in great heat has risen early has

travelled incessantly is hungry and without

water and is striving to reach a distance
third an enemy who has been encamped

long in one place who is without

provisions when the farmers are vexed

and indignant who has suffered frequent

calamities and whose officers are unable

to establish confidence
fourth when the enemys funds are

exhausted fuel and fodder scarce whenpg 

the heavens have been overcast by long

continued rain when there is the desire to

loot but no place to loot withal
fifth when their numbers are few

when water is scarce when men and horses

are scourged by pestilence and from no

quarter is succour at hand
sixth when night falls and the way is

yet far when officers and men are worn

out and fearful weary and without food and

have laid aside their armour and are resting
seventh when the generals authority is

weak the officials false and the soldiers

unsettled when their army has been

alarmed and no help is forthcoming
eighth when the battle formation is not

yet fixed or camp pitched when climbing

a hill or passing through a difficult place

when half is hidden and half exposed
an enemy in these situations may be

smitten without hesitation
there are six enemies that without

consulting oracles should be avoided
first wide and vast territories and a

large and rich population
pg 
second where the officials care for the

people and bestow bountiful favours and

rewards
third where rewards are well deserved

punishment accurately apportioned and

operations undertaken only when the time

is fitting
fourth where merit is recognised and

given rank wise men appointed and ability

employed
fifth where the troops are many and

their weapons excellent
sixth when help is at hand on every

side or from a powerful ally
for if the enemy excel in the foregoing

he must be avoided without hesitation as

it is written if it be judged good advance

if it be known to be difficult retreat
and lord wen asked and said
i desire to know how the interior of

the enemy can be known from his outer

appearance the form of his camp by

observing his advance and how victory

may be determined
and wu answered and said
pg 
if the coming of the enemy be reckless

like roaring waters his banners and pennons

disordered and horses and men frequently

looking behind then ten can be struck with

one panic will certainly seize them
before the various princes have

assembled before harmony has been

established between lord and lieges before

ditches have been dug or regulations

established and the army is alarmed

wishing to advance but unable wishing

to retreat but unable then the force can

strike twice their numbers and in a

hundred fights there is no fear of retreat
lord wen asked
how can the enemy be certainly

defeated
wu answered and said
make certain of the enemys real condition

and quickly strike his weak point

strike an enemy who has just arrived from

afar before his ranks are arranged or one

who has eaten and has not completed his

dispositions or an enemy who is hurrying

about or is busily occupied or has notpg 

made favourable use of the ground or has

let pass the opportunity or one who has

come a long distance and those in rear are

late and have not rested
strike an enemy who is half across

waters or who is on a difficult or narrow

road or whose flags and banners are in

confusion or who is frequently changing

position or whose general is not in accord

with the soldiers or who is fearful
all such should be assaulted by the

picked men and the remainder of the

army should be divided and follow after

them they may be attacked at once

without hesitation

iii

control of the army
lord wen said
what is of first importance in operations

of war
wu answered and said
lightness of which there are fourpg 

natures weight of which there are two

natures and confidence must be clearly

comprehended
and wen said
what are these
and wu answered
if the way be easy the horses are light

of foot if the horses be light of foot the

chariots travel freely if the chariots travel

easily men can ride in them without

difficulty if the men be free to move

the fight prospers if the difficult and easy

ways be known the horses are lightened

if the horses be fed at proper intervals the

chariots are swift if there be plenty of oil

on the axles of the chariots the riders are

quickly conveyed if the spears be sharp

and the armour strong the men make the

fight easy
large rewards in advance heavy

punishment in retreat and impartiality

in their bestowal are required
he who well understands these things

is the master of victory
and lord wen asked and said
pg 
by what means can the army gain the

victory
and wu answered
the foundation of victory is good

government
again wen asked and said
is it not determined by numbers
and wu replied
if laws and orders be not clear if

rewards and punishments be not just if

the bell be sounded and they halt not or

drum be beaten and men do not advance

even if there be a hundred thousand men

at arms they are of no avail
where there is order then there is

propriety at rest and dignity in motion

none can withstand the attack and retreat

forbids pursuit motion is regulated and

movements to right and left are made in

answer to the signal if the ranks be

cut asunder formation is preserved if

scattered they are maintained in fortune

or in danger there is unity if a number

be collected they cannot be separated

they may be used but not wearied inpg 

whatever situation they are placed nothing

under heaven can withstand them the

army may be called a father and his

children
and wu said
in marching movements and halts must

be properly adjusted suitable occasions for

rationing not missed the strength of men

and horses not exhausted if these three

things be observed the commands of the

superior can be carried out if the commands

of the superior be carried out order is maintained

if advances and halts be without

method victualling unsuitable horses and

men tired and wearyneither unsaddled or

housedit is because the orders cannot

be obeyed if the orders be set aside

there is disorder in the camp and in

battledefeat
wu the master said
on that depository of corpses the battlefield

if there be certain expectation of

death there is life if there be happy

expectation of life there is death the

good general is like unto one sitting inpg 

a leaking ship or lying under a burning

roof the wisest man cannot contrive

against him the strongest man cannot

destroy his composure and the enemys

onslaught can be withstood for procrastination

is the greatest enemy of the

general disasters to the army are born of

indecision
wu the master said
men meet their death from lack of

ability or unskilfulness wherefore training

is the first requirement of war one man

with a knowledge of war can teach ten ten

men skilled in war can teach one hundred

one hundred can teach one thousand one

thousand can teach ten thousand and ten

thousand men can train an army
an enemy from a distance should be

awaited and struck at short range an

enemy that is tired should be met in good

order hunger should be opposed by full

bellies the battle formation should be

round or square the men should kneel or

stand go or remain move to the right

or left advance or retire concentrate orpg 

disperse close or extend when the signal

is given
all these changes must be learnt and

the weapons distributed this is the

business of the general
wu the master said
in the teaching of war spears are given

to the short bows and catapults to the tall

banners and standards to the strong the

bell and drum to the bold fodder and

provisions to the feeble the arrangement

of the plan to the wise men of the same

district should be united and groups and

squads should help each other at one

beat of the drum the ranks are put in

order at two beats of the drum formation

will be made at three beats of the drum

food will be issued at four beats of the

drum the men will prepare to march at

five beats of the drum ranks will be formed

when the drums beat together then the

standards will be raised
and lord wen asked and said
what is the way of marching and halting

an army
pg 
and wu answered
natural ovens and dragons heads should

be avoided natural ovens are the mouths

of large valleys dragons heads are the

extremities of large mountains the green

dragons banners should be placed on the

left and the white tigers on the right the

red sparrows in front the snakes and

tortoises behind the pole star standard

above and the soldiers will look to the

standard
when going forth to battle the direction

of the wind must be studied if blowing

in the direction of the enemy the soldiers

will be assembled and follow the wind if a

head wind the position will be strengthened

and a wait made for the wind to change
and lord wen asked and said
in what way should horses be treated
and wu answered and said
the places where they are kept should

be made comfortable fodder should be

suitable and timely in winter their stables

should be warmed and in summer sheltered

from the heat their coats clipped theirpg 

feet carefully pared their attention directed

so that they be not alarmed their paces

regulated and their going and halting

trained horses and men should be in accord

and then the horses can be used the

harness the saddle bit bridle and reins

must be strong if the horse be without

vice at the beginning he can be used to

the end if the horse be hungry it is good

if his belly be full his value decreases if

the sun be falling and the way still long

dismount frequently for it is proper that

the men be worked but the horses must be

used with discretion so that they may be

prepared should the enemy suddenly attack

us
if these things be well known then

there is free passage under heaven

pg 
iv

qualities of the general
wu the master said
the leader of the army is one who is

master of both arms and letters he who

is both brave and tender can be entrusted

with troops
in the popular estimation of generals

courage alone is regarded nevertheless

courage is but one of the qualifications of

the leader courage is heedless in encounter

and rash encounter which is

ignorant of the consequences cannot be

called good
there are five matters which leaders

must carefully consider
first reason second preparation

third determination fourth vigilance

fifth simplicity
with reason a multitude can be controlled

like a small number
pg 
preparedness sees an enemy outside the

gate
determination before the enemy has no

thought of life
even after a victory vigilance behaves

as before the first encounter
simplicity ensures few regulations and

preserves order
when the leader receives his orders he

forthwith departs not until the enemy

has been vanquished does he speak of

return this is the duty of the general
wherefore from the day of departure

of the army the general seeks glory in

death and dreams not of return in dishonour
wu the master said
in war there are four important influences
first spirit second ground third

opportunity fourth force
the military value of the nations forcesof

one hundred times ten thousand

fighting mendepends upon the personality

of one man alone this is called the

influence of spirit
pg 
when the road is steep and narrow when

there are famous mountains and fastnesses

where ten men can defend and one thousand

cannot pass them by such is the influence

of ground
when spies have been skilfully sown and

mounted men pass to and from the enemys

camp so that his masses are divided his

sovereign and ministers vexed with each

other and superiors and inferiors mutually

censorious this is the moment of opportunity
when the linchpins are secure the oars

and sweeps ready for use in the boats the

armed men trained for war and the horses

exercised we have what is called the influence

of force
he who understands these four matters

has the qualifications of a general furthermore

dignity virtue benevolence courage

are needed to lead the troops to calm

the multitude to put fear in the enemy

to remove doubts when orders are

issued the subordinates do not defy them

wheresoever the army is that place thepg 

enemy avoids if these four virtues be

present the country is strong if they be

not present the country is overthrown
of such is the good general
wu the master said
the use of drums and bells is to attract

the ear of flags standards and banners to

strike the eye of laws and penalties to

put fear in the heart
to attract the ear the sound must be

clear to strike the eye the colours must

be bright the heart is awed by punishment

therefore punishment must be strict
if these three matters be not ordered

the state may peradventure be preserved

but defeat by the enemy is certain therefore

as it has been said if these three

things be present there is no departing

from the commands of the general when

he orders there is no going back from

death
wu the master said
the secret of war is first to know who

is the enemys general and to judge his

ability if our plans depend on his dispg positions

then success will be achieved

without toil
if their general be stupid and heedlessly

trustful he may be enticed by fraud if

he be avaricious and careless of his fame

he may be bribed with gifts if he make

unconsidered movements without plan he

should be tired out and placed in difficulties

if the superiors be wealthy and proud

and the inferiors avaricious and resentful

they should be set against each other an

enemy that is undetermined now advancing

and then retreating whose soldiers have

nought wherein to put their trust should

be alarmed and put to flight
when an enemy thinks lightly of the

general and desires to return home the

easy roads should be blocked and the

difficult and narrow roads opened await

their coming and capture them
if their advance be easy and retreat difficult

await their coming and then advance

against them
if their advance be difficult and retreat

easy then press and strike them
pg 
an army that is camped in marshy

ground where there are no watercourses

and long and frequent rains should be

inundated
an army that is camped in wild

marshes covered with dark and overhanging

grass and brambles and swept by

frequent high winds should be overthrown

by fire
an army that has halted long without

moving whose general and soldiers have

grown careless and neglect precautions

should be approached by stealth and taken

by surprise
lord wen asked saying
if the two armies be facing each other

and the name of the enemys general unknown

in what manner can we discover

it
and wu answered and said
a brave man of low degree lightly

but well equipped should be employed

he should think only of flight and naught

of advantage then if he observe the

enemys pursuit if there be first a haltpg 

and then an advance order is established

if we retreat and the enemy pursue but

pretend not to be able to overtake us

see an advantage but pretend not to be

aware of it then their general may be

called a wise general and conflict with

him must be avoided if their army be

full of uproar their banners and standards

disordered their soldiers going about or

remaining of their own accord some in

line others in column if such an enemy

be eager to pursue and see an advantage

which they are desperate to seize then

their general is a fool even if there be

a host they may be taken

pg 
v

suiting the occasion
lord wen asked and said
if strong chariots good horses strong

and valiant soldiers suddenly meet the

enemy and are thrown into confusion and

ranks broken what should be done
and wu answered and said
in general the method of fighting is

to effect order in daylight by means of

flags and banners pennons and batons

at night by gongs and drums whistles

and flutes if a signal be made to the

left the troops move to the left if to the

right they move to the right advance

is made at the sound of the drum halt

at the sound of the gong one blast of

the whistle is for advance two for the

rally if those who disobey be cut down

the forces are subject to authority if

officers and soldiers carry out orders apg 

superior enemy cannot exist no position

is impregnable in the attack
lord wen asked and said
what is to be done if the enemy be

many and we be few
and wu answered and said
avoid such an enemy on open ground

and meet him in the narrow way for

as it is written if  is to stand against

 there is naught better than a pass

if  are to hold against  there is

nothing better than a steep place if

 are to strike  there is nothing

better than a difficult place if a small

force with beat of gong and drum suddenly

arise in a narrow way even a host will

be upset wherefore it is written he

who has a multitude seeks the plain and

he who has few seeks the narrow way
and lord wen asked and said
a mighty host strong and courageous

which is on the defence with a mountain

behind a precipice between high ground

on the right and a river on the left with

deep moats and high walls and which haspg 

artillery whose retreat is like the removal

of a mountain advance like the hurricane

and whose supplies are in abundance is

an enemy against whom long defence is

difficult in effect what should be done

in such a case
and wu answered and said
this indeed is a great question whose

issue depends not upon the might of

chariot and horse but upon the schemes

of a wise man
let  chariots and  horse well

equipped and with footmen added to them

be divided into five armies and a road

allotted to each army
then if there be five armies and each

army take a different road the enemy will

be puzzled and know not in what quarter

to be prepared if the enemys defence be

strong and united send envoys quickly to

him to discover his intention if he listen

to our advices he will strike camp and

withdraw but if he listen not to our

advice but strikes down the messenger and

burns his papers then divide and attackpg 

from five quarters if victorious do not

pursue if defeated flee to a distance if

feigning retreat proceed slowly and if the

enemy approach strike swiftly
one army will hold the enemy in front

with another cut his rear two more with

gags in their mouths will attack his weak

point whether on the right or on the

left if five armies thus make alternate

onslaughts success is certain
this is the way to strike strength
and lord wen asked and said
if the enemy draw near and encompass

us and we would retreat but there is no

way and in our multitude there is fear

what should be done
and wu answered and said
in such a case if we be many and they

be few divide and fall upon them if the

enemy be many and we be few use

stratagem and act according to opportunity

and if opportunities be untiringly seized

even if the enemy be many he will be

reduced to subjection
pg 
lord wen asked and said
if in a narrow valley with steep places on

either side the enemy be met and they are

many and we are few what should be done
and wu answered and said
if they be met among hills woods in

deep mountains or wide fens advance

quickly retire swiftly and hesitate not if

the enemy be suddenly met among high

mountains or deep valleys be the first to

strike the drum and fall upon them let

bow and cross bow advance shoot and

capture observe the state of their ranks

and if there be confusion do not hesitate

to strike
lord wen asked and said
if the enemy be suddenly met in a

narrow place with high mountains on either

side and advance and retreat are alike

impossible what should be done in such a

case
and wu answered and said
this is called war in valleys where

numbers are of no avail the ablest officers

should be collected and set against thepg 

enemy men light of foot and well armed

should be placed in front the chariots

divided the horsemen drawn up and placed

in ambush on four sides with many leagues

between and without showing their weapons

then the enemy will certainly make his

defence firm and neither advance or retreat

whereupon the standards will be raised

and the ranks of banners shown the

mountains left and camp pitched in the

plain
the enemy will then be fearful and

should be challenged by chariot and horse

and allowed no rest
this is the method of fighting in valleys
and lord wen asked and said
if the enemy be met in a marsh where

the water is out so that the wheels of the

chariots sink in and the shafts be covered

and the chariots and horsemen overcome by

the waters when there are no boats or oars

and it is impossible either to advance or

retreat what should be done in such a

case
and wu answered and said
pg 
this is called water fighting chariots

and horsemen cannot be used and they

must be put for a time on one side go up

to the top of a high place and look out to

the four quarters then the state of the

waters will certainly be seen their extent

and the deep places and shallows fully

ascertained then by stratagem the enemy

may be defeated
if the enemy should cross the waters he

should be engaged when half over
and lord wen asked and said
if there has been long continued rain

so that the horses sink and the chariots

cannot move if the enemy appear from

four quarters and the forces are frightened

what is the course in such a case
and wu answered and said
when wet and overcast the chariots

should halt when fine and dry they should

arise seek height and avoid low places

drive the strong chariots and choose well

the road on which to advance or halt if

the enemy suddenly arise immediately

pursue them
pg 
lord wen asked and said
if our fields and pastures be suddenly

pillaged and our oxen and sheep taken

what should be done
and wu answered and said
lawless enemies that arise are to be

feared defend well and do not reply

when at sunset they seek to withdraw

they will certainly be overladen and fearful

striving to return quickly to their homes

connection will be lost then if they be pursued

and attacked they can be overthrown
wu the master said
the way of attacking the enemy and

investing his castle is as follows
when the outlying buildings have been

taken and the assaulting parties enter the

innermost sanctuary make use of the

enemys officials and take charge of their

weapons let the army on no account fell

trees or enter dwellings cut the crops slay

the six domestic animals or burn the barns

and show the people that there is no cruel

desire those who wish to surrender should

be received and freed from anxiety

pg 
vi

encouragement of the troops
and lord wen asked and said
if punishment be just and reward impartial

is victory thereby gained
and wu answered and said
i cannot speak of all the things that

concern justice and impartiality but on

these alone dependence cannot be placed
if the people hear the word of command

or listen to the order with rejoicing if

when the army be raised and a multitude

assembled they go forth gladly to the fight

if in the tumult of the fight when blade

crosses blade the soldiers gladly die upon

these three things can the lord of the people

place his trust
and lord wen said
how can this be brought about
and wu answered and said
seek out merit advance and reward it

and encourage those without fame
pg 
accordingly lord wen set seats in the

garden of the palace in three rows and

made a feast unto his chief retainers in

the first row were set those of chief

merit and on the table were placed the

best meats and precious utensils those

of medium merit were set in the middle

row and the utensils on the table were

fewer in number those without merit

were set in the last row and utensils of

no value were put before them and

when the feast was over and they had all

departed the parents wives and children

of those with merit were given presents

outside the gates of the palace according

to their degree
further messengers were sent yearly

with gifts to condole with the parents of

those who had lost a son in the service of

the state and to show that they were had

in remembrance
and after this was carried out for three

years the people of chin gathered an army

and came as far as the western river

and when the soldiers of wei heard thispg 

without waiting for orders they armed

themselves and fell upon them and they

that went forth were  in number
and lord wen called wu and said
the words that you spoke unto me

have they not indeed been carried out
and wu answered and said
i have heard that there are men great

and small souls grand and feeble
as a trial let  men without merit

be collected and placed under my command

against the country of chin if we fail the

state will be the laughingstock among the

princes and its power under heaven will be

lost if a desperate robber be hidden in

a wide plain and  men be pursuing

him their glances will be furtive like the

owl looking backward like the wolf for

they are in fear of harm from a sudden

onslaught
one desperate man can put fear in the

hearts of a thousand now if this host

of  men become as a desperate thief

and are led against chin there is nought

to fear
pg 
on hearing these words lord wen agreed

and adding further  chariots and 

horse the hosts of chin were overthrown

all being due to the encouragement of the

troops
on the day before the battle wu gave

orders to the forces saying
the army will attack the enemys

chariots horse and foot in accordance

with our commands if the chariots do

not capture the enemys chariots or the

horse those of the enemys or the foot the

enemys footmen even if their army be

overthrown no merit will be gained
therefore on the day of the battle the

orders were simple and fear of wei shook

the heavens

 the chinese army consisted of  the lu of

 the chuyin was a large tower or work constructed to

give command over the interior of the enemys fortress




high poles were also erected from the top of which

archers each encased in an arrowproof box and raised by a

 this passage was written on the standard of takeda

shingen one of japans most famous generals

continually thinking of and slipping back to their homes

 the population was divided for military purposes into

groups of eight families in time of war each group sent one

man into the field furnished his wants and provided for

his family therefore if  men are taken 

homes are affected

 so called because they are put to death when the enemy

finds out that he has been tricked

 messengers and others who do not disguise their identity

are included under this heading

 literally right and left men ie they who sat on either

side

 all numbers connected with weapons were yin that
