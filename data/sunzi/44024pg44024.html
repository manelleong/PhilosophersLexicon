<h2> <a id="THE_BOOK_OF_WAR">THE BOOK OF WAR</a></h2>
<h2> <a id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Written in the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, Suntzu
and Wutzu still remain the most celebrated
works on war in the literature of China.
While the chariot has gone, and weapons
have changed, these ancient masters have
held their own, since they deal chiefly with
the fundamental principles of war, with the
influence of politics and human nature on
military operations; and they show in a
most striking way how unchanging these
principles are.</p>
<p>When these books were written, China
was a conglomerate of principalities in
continual ferment. Personal ambition and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
intrigue, and not the wishes of the people,
were the main factors in these wars.
Patriotism, or a popular cause, could not,
therefore, be relied on to maintain the
<i>moral</i> of the levies. Instead of these, what
may be called the force of despair is pointed
out as the most powerful agent in giving
cohesion and energy to an army. The
general is urged to take a vigorous offensive;
and to act at a distance from his base,
where defeat means disaster, and where
desertion is minimised owing to the distance
from home. He should, in fact, burn his
boats before an action, or, in Chinese phrase,
act as one who removes the ladder from
under those mounted upon the roof.</p>
<p>On the other hand, every care must be
taken not to render the enemy desperate;
and, as an instance of this, Sun observes
that an opponent should on no account
be completely surrounded. A loop-hole of
escape weakens the resolution of the general
and the energy of his troops.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that <i>moral</i>, or
the spirit of the troops, is thus considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
a determining factor in war. The Chinese
are perhaps unusually affected by climatic
conditions. As is well known, the umbrella
was part of a soldier’s equipment; and for
the same reasons, the sunny side of high
ground is recommended as most suitable for
defence, tactical considerations permitting.</p>
<p>The large number of bannermen in the
Chinese army was out of all proportion to
the service of standards in providing rallying
points. The chief use of banners was to
maintain the spirit of the troops. A forest
of banners, held erect, gave a feeling of
liveliness and security to the ranks, in the
same way as a military band, and when
Sun remarks that the march of an army
should be calm like the forest, he is using
a simile that is not inappropriate.</p>
<p>Probably owing to the fact that the
profession of arms has never been highly
regarded in China, we find that the ruler
of the state did not usually take the field,
but employed a professional to command
the army—one of the masters of war who
wandered from state to state at that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with the secrets of victory to impart to the
highest bidder. The question of political
interference with the general in the field
naturally arises under these conditions.
The two sages point out, that to unite the
nation under firm and just government is
the business of the ruler and necessary to
victory; but that the general is the best
judge of the questions that arise on a
distant field, and that all interference with
him causes delay and disaster.</p>
<p>War meaning ravage, it was essential
that the operations should be conducted
in the enemy’s territory. Once there, however,
a vigorous offensive is no longer
advised. “At first behave with the discretion
of a maiden” is the counsel of Sun.
The enemy must be induced to take the
initiative, and when he is worn out by
marching, or makes a false move, “then,”
says the master, “dart in like a rabbit.”</p>
<p>Unlike the tactics of the Japanese, in
whom the spirit of attack burns so strongly,
those of Suntzu and Wutzu are essentially
of the offensive-defensive order—manœuvre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
before fighting, and non-committal until the
enemy has shown his hand. The business
of the general is to avoid encounter in
battle until the enemy is no longer capable
of offering a successful resistance.</p>
<p>The masters do not make, however, the
mistake of advocating a passive defensive.
Suntzu lays down that the division of the
forces which this strategy involves, is to
be everywhere weak, rendering the army
liable to be taken in detail by the concentrated
forces of the enemy. It is rather the
defence which avoids battle by mobility
and manœuvre, induces the enemy by
stratagem to divide his forces, or act in
conformity with our wishes, and then falls
upon him.</p>
<p>With regard to the tactics of the battlefield,
the pitched battle, or, in other words,
the frontal attack, is considered unworthy
of the skilful general. The plan of attack
should consist, broadly speaking, in the
division of the army into two forces. The
enemy is “attracted and engaged by one
force, and defeated with the other;” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
here we have the containing or secondary
attack, and the main or reserve force
which decides the battle of to-day—a
most striking instance of the continuity of
military principles.</p>
<p>Considerable space is devoted to the
influence of ground on war. The passage
of defiles and rivers is still conducted in
the same way. The many large rivers
of China naturally affected military operations;
and, among other axioms, it is laid
down that the passage of a river should
not be disputed, as the enemy will probably
give up the attempt, and make the passage
untouched at some other point, but that
he should be attacked when half his force
is across the stream. Again, an army should
not encamp on a river below the enemy,
as it is thereby liable to be inundated, or to
have its water poisoned; or the enemy may
come down stream and make a sudden
attack.</p>
<p>While both writers were professional
soldiers, they show a fine disinterestedness
by repeatedly pointing out that even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
successful war brings evil in its train.
Wu remarks that “few are those who have
gained power on earth by many victories,”
and he is insistent that war should not be
undertaken until a careful comparison of
the two sides shows that victory is certain;
and he adds, “The army which conquers
makes certain of victory and then attacks,
while the army that is defeated fights in
the hope of success.”</p>
<p>Hence the importance they assign to
intelligence of the enemy, and to the spy;
and as the sages dealt with war between
members of the same race, the work of
spies was greatly facilitated. The spy was
treated with great honour by his countrymen,
and the fact that many of the national
heroes of China were spies, shows that the
part that they played was not forgotten.
They frequently toiled for years, and rose
to high rank in the enemy’s service; and
thus, by wrong counsel and by spreading
mistrust in his ranks, they became a two-edged
sword in the hands of the general.
“Wonderful, indeed, is their power,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
exclaims Sun; but he also reminds us that
their management is the most difficult and
delicate duty of the general.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Sun and Wu are perhaps held in even
greater reverence in Japan than in China,
where war is looked upon as a troublesome
phase in national life, and victory in battle
is not considered the greatest achievement
of a state. Far otherwise is it in Japan;
and successive generations of her soldiers
have been brought up on Sun and Wu.
Like other arts, mystery was formerly supposed
to surround the art of war, a belief
that was encouraged by the strategist; and
for a considerable time, the few copies of
this book, that were brought over from
China to Japan, were jealously guarded
by their possessors. Later, as they became
known, an army of Japanese commentators
arose—for Chinese literature is thought
compressed, to be unfolded in the mind
of the reader.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>To-day Sun and Wu have given way to
the scientific works of European writers,
but their sayings have become proverbs,
and their influence undoubtedly helped the
Japanese to victory in the late war. Belief
in the importance of a knowledge of the
enemy and his resources, of preparation and
training, had grown out of a long study
of these ancient masters; and since it was
the vital importance of a successful issue
to the Japanese which, after all, fired their
resolution and carried them through, they
proved the sage’s words that it is the energy,
born of despair, that wins the victory.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Little is known of the life of either
master. They were in no sense patriots but
professional strategists, continually changing
their employer. Chinese history tells a
famous story about Sun. A certain ruler
asked Sun to give a practical demonstration
of his principles in the neighbourhood
of the palace, and entrusted him with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the women of the court for this purpose.
During the operations, the leader of one
of the sides did not obey the master’s
instructions, and her execution was ordered.
She happened to be the king’s favourite
wife, but Sun pointed out that the king’s
wish that her life should be spared was
a case of political interference with the
general in the field; and the sentence was
carried out.</p>
<p>Wu is represented as a person of low
moral character. On two separate occasions,
for fear of giving rise to suspicion, he killed
one of his wives who belonged to a state
with which his employer at the time was
at war; and, graver still in the eyes of

PRELIMINARY RECKONING</h2>
<p>The words of Sun the Master:—</p>
<p>To all nations War is a great matter.
Upon the army death or life depend: it is
the means of the existence or destruction
<i>of the State</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore it must be diligently studied.</p>
<p>Now, in war, besides stratagem and
the situation, there are five indispensable
matters. The first is called The Way;<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a>
the second, Heaven; the third, Earth; the
fourth, the Leader; the fifth, Law.</p>
<p>The <i>Way</i> or the proper conduct of man.
If the ruling authority be upright, the
people are united: fearless of danger, their
lives are at the service of their Lord.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Heaven.</i> Yin and Yang;<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a> heat and
cold; time and season.</p>
<p><i>Earth.</i> Distance; nature; extent;
strategic position.</p>
<p>The <i>Leader</i>. Intelligence; truth; benevolence;
courage and strictness.</p>
<p><i>Law.</i> Partition and ordering of troops.</p>
<p>These things must be known by the
leader: to know them is to conquer; to
know them not is to be defeated.</p>
<p>Further, with regard to these and the
following seven matters, the condition of
the enemy must be compared with our own.</p>
<p>The seven matters are:—</p>
<p>The virtue of the prince; the ability
of the general; natural advantages; the
discipline of the armies; the strength of
the soldiers; training of the soldiers;
justice both in reward and punishment.</p>
<p>Knowing these things, I can foretell the
victor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>If a general under me fight according
to my plans, he always conquers, and I
continue to employ him; if he differ from
my plans, he will be defeated and dismissed
from my service.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with regard to the foregoing,
considering that with us lies the advantage,
and the generals agreeing, we create a
situation which promises victory; but as
the moment and method cannot be fixed
beforehand, the plan must be modified
according to circumstances.</p>
<p>War is a thing of pretence: therefore,
when capable of action, we pretend disability;
when near to the enemy, we
pretend to be far; when far away, we
pretend to be near.</p>
<p>Allure the enemy by giving him a small
advantage. Confuse and capture him. If
there be defects, give an appearance of
perfection, and awe the enemy. Pretend
to be strong, and so cause the enemy to
avoid you. Make him angry, and confuse
his plans. Pretend to be inferior, and
cause him to despise you. If he have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
superabundance of strength, tire him out;
if united, make divisions in his camp.
Attack weak points, and appear in unexpected
places.</p>
<p>These are the secrets of the successful
strategist, therefore they must not be made
known beforehand.</p>
<p>At the reckoning in the Sanctuary before
fighting, victory is to the side that excels
<i>in the foregoing matters</i>. They that have
many of these will conquer; they that
have few will not conquer; hopeless,
indeed, are they that have none.</p>
<p>If the condition of both sides with regard
to these matters be known, I can foretell
the victor.</p>

OPERATIONS OF WAR</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>Now the requirements of war are such
that we need a thousand light chariots with
four horses each; a thousand leather-covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
chariots, and one hundred thousand armoured
men; and we must send supplies to distant
fields. Wherefore the cost at home and in
the field, the entertainment of guests, glue
and lacquer for repairs, and necessities for
the upkeep of waggons and armour are such
that in one day a thousand pieces of gold
are spent. With that amount a force of
one hundred thousand men can be raised:—you
have the instruments of victory.</p>
<p>But, even if victorious, let the operations
long continue, and the soldiers’ ardour decreases,
the weapons become worn, and, if
a siege be undertaken, strength disappears.</p>
<p>Again, if the war last long, the country’s
means do not suffice. Then, when the
soldiers are worn out, weapons blunted,
strength gone and funds spent, neighbouring
princes arise and attack that weakened
country. At such a time the wisest man
cannot mend the matter.</p>
<p>For, while quick accomplishment has been
known to give the victory to the unskilful,
the skilful general has never gained
advantage from lengthy operations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>In fact, there never has been a country
which has benefited from a prolonged war.</p>
<p>He who does not know the evils of war
will not reap advantage thereby. He who
is skilful in war does not make a second
levy, does not load his supply waggons thrice.</p>
<p>War material and arms we obtain from
home, but food sufficient for the army’s
needs can be taken from the enemy.</p>
<p>The cost of supplying the army in distant
fields is the chief drain on the resources of
a state: if the war be distant, the citizens
are impoverished.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of an army prices
are high, and so the money of the soldiers
and followers is used up. Likewise the
state funds are exhausted, and frequent
levies must be made; the strength of the
army is dissipated, money is spent, the
citizen’s home swept bare: in all, seven-tenths
of his income is forfeited. Again,
as regards State property, chariots are
broken, horses worn out, armour and
helmet, arrow and bow, spear, shield, pike
and fighting tower, waggon and oxen used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and gone, so that six-tenths of the Government’s
income is spent.</p>
<p>Therefore the intelligent general strives
to feed on the enemy; one bale of the
enemy’s rice counts as twenty from our
own waggons; one bundle of the enemy’s
forage is better than twenty of our own.</p>
<p>Incitement must be given to vanquish
the enemy.</p>
<p>They who take advantage of the enemy
should be rewarded.</p>
<p>They who are the first to lay their hands
on more than ten of the enemy’s chariots
should be rewarded; the enemy’s standard
on the chariots exchanged for our own; the
captured chariots mixed with our own
chariots and taken into use.</p>
<p>The accompanying warriors must be
treated well, so that, while the enemy is
beaten, our side increases in strength.</p>
<p>Now the object of war is victory; not
lengthy operations, even skilfully conducted.</p>
<p>The good general is the lord of the
people’s lives, the guardian of the country’s
welfare.</p>

<h2><a id="suntzu_III">III</a><br>
THE ATTACK BY STRATAGEM</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>Now by the laws of war, better than
defeating a country by fire and the sword,
is to take it without strife.</p>
<p>Better to capture the enemy’s army intact
than to overcome it after fierce resistance.</p>
<p>Better to capture the “Lu,”<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a> the “Tsu”
or the “Wu” whole, than to destroy them
in battle.</p>
<p>To fight and conquer one hundred times
is not the perfection of attainment, for the
supreme art is to subdue the enemy without
fighting.</p>
<p>Wherefore the most skilful warrior outwits
the enemy by superior stratagem; the
next in merit prevents the enemy from
uniting his forces; next to him is he who
engages the enemy’s army; while to besiege
his citadel is the worst expedient.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>A siege should not be undertaken if it
can possibly be avoided. For, before a
siege can be commenced, three months are
required for the construction of stages,
battering-rams and siege engines; then a
further three months are required in front
of the citadel, in order to make the
“Chuyin.”<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a> Wherefore the general is
angered, his patience exhausted, his men
surge like ants against the ramparts <i>before
the time is ripe</i>, and one-third of them are
killed to no purpose. Such are the misfortunes
that sieges entail.</p>
<p>Therefore the master of war causes the
enemy’s forces to yield, but without fighting;
he captures his fortress, but without
besieging it; and without lengthy fighting
takes the enemy’s kingdom. Without tarnishing
his weapons he gains the complete
advantage.</p>
<p>This is the assault by stratagem.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>By the rules of war, if ten times as strong
as the enemy, surround him; with five
times his strength, attack; with double his
numbers, divide. If equal in strength,
exert to the utmost, and fight; if inferior
in numbers, manœuvre <i>and await the opportunity</i>;
if altogether inferior, offer no chance
of battle. A determined stand by inferior
numbers does but lead to their capture.</p>
<p>The warrior is the country’s support. If
his aid be entire, the country is of necessity
strong; if it be at all deficient, then is the
country weak.</p>
<p>Now a prince may embarrass his army in
three ways, namely:—</p>
<p>Ignorant that the army in the field should
not advance, to order it to go forward; or,
ignorant that the army should not retreat,
order it to retire.</p>
<p>This is to tie the army as with a string.</p>
<p>Ignorant of military affairs, to rule the
armies in the same way as the state.</p>
<p>This is to perplex the soldiers.</p>
<p>Ignorant of the situation of the army, to
settle its dispositions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>This is to fill the soldiers with distrust.</p>
<p>If the army be perplexed and distrustful,
then dangers from neighbouring princes
arise. The army is confounded, and offered
up to the enemy.</p>
<p>There are five occasions when victory can
be foretold:—</p>
<p>When the general knows the time to
fight and when not to fight; or understands
when to employ large or small numbers;
when government and people are of one
mind; when the state is prepared, and
chooses the enemy’s unguarded moment for
attack; when the general possesses ability,
and is not interfered with by his prince.</p>
<p>These five things are the heralds of
victory.</p>
<p>It has been said aforetime that he who
knows both sides has nothing to fear in a
hundred fights; he who is ignorant of the
enemy, and fixes his eyes only on his
own side, conquers, and the next time is
defeated; he who not only is ignorant of
the enemy, but also of his own resources,
is invariably defeated.</p>

<h2><a id="suntzu_IV">IV</a><br>
THE ORDER OF BATTLE</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>The ancient masters of war first made
their armies invincible, then waited until
the adversary could with certainty be
defeated.</p>
<p>The causes of defeat come from within;
victory is born in the enemy’s camp.</p>
<p>Skilful soldiers make defeat impossible,
and further render the enemy incapable
of victory.</p>
<p>But, as it is written, the conditions
necessary for victory may be present,
but they cannot always be obtained.</p>
<p>If victory be unattainable, we stand
on the defensive; if victory be sure, we
attack.</p>
<p>Deficiency compels defence; super-abundance
permits attack.</p>
<p>The skilful in defence crouch, hidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in the deepest shades; the skilful in attack
push to the topmost heaven.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>If these precepts be observed, victory is
certain.</p>
<p>A victory, even if popularly proclaimed
as such by the common folk, may not be
a true success. To win in fight, and for
the kingdom to say, “Well done,” does
not mark the summit of attainment. To
lift an autumn fleece<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6">[6]</a> is no proof of
strength; the eyes that only see the sun
and moon are not the eagle’s; to hear the
thunder is no great thing.</p>
<p>As has been said aforetime, the able
warrior gains the victory without desperate
and bloody engagements, and wins thereby
no reputation for wisdom or brave deeds.
To fight is to win, for he attacks only when
the enemy has sown the seeds of defeat.</p>
<p>Moreover, the skilful soldier in a secure
position does not let pass the moment
when the enemy should be attacked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<p>The army that conquers makes certain of
victory, and then seeks battle.</p>
<p>The army destined to defeat, fights,
trusting that chance may bring success to
its arms.</p>
<p>The skilful leader is steadfast in the
“Way”; upholds the Law, and thereby
controls the issue.</p>
<p>Touching the laws of war, it is said: first,
the rule; second, the measure; third, the
tables; fourth, the scales; fifth, the foretelling
of victory.</p>
<p>For the rule is the survey of land; the
measure tells the amount of that land’s
produce; the tables its population; from
the scales their weight or quality is made
known; and then can we calculate victory
or defeat.</p>
<p>The army that conquers as against the
army destined to defeat, is as a beam
against a feather in the scales. The attack
of conquering forces is as the outburst of
long-pent-up waters into sunken valleys.</p>
<p>Such are the orders of battle.</p>

<h2><a id="suntzu_V">V</a><br>
THE SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>The control of large numbers is possible,
and like unto that of small numbers, if we
subdivide them.</p>
<p>By means of drum, bell and flag,<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a> the
direction of large forces in battle is possible,
and like unto the direction of small forces.</p>
<p>By the skilful interchange of normal and
abnormal manœuvres are the armies certainly
preserved from defeat.</p>
<p>The enemy is crushed, like the fall of a
grindstone upon an egg, by knowledge of
his strength and weakness, and by the
employment of truth and artifice.</p>
<p>Moreover, in battle the enemy is engaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
with the normal and defeated by the
abnormal force.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The abnormal force, skilfully handled,
is like the heaven and earth, eternal;
as the tides and the flow of rivers, unceasing;
like the sun and moon, for ever
interchanging; coming and passing, as the
seasons.</p>
<p>There are five notes; but by combinations,
innumerable harmonies are produced.
There are but five colours; but if we mix
them, the shades are infinite. There are
five tastes, but if we mix them there
are more flavours than the palate can
distinguish.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>In war there are but two forces, the
normal and the abnormal; but they are
capable of infinite variation. Their mutual
interchange is like a wheel, having neither
beginning or end. They are a mystery
that none can penetrate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>As the rush of rock-shouldering torrents,
so is the spirit of the troops.</p>
<p>Like the well-judged flight of the falcon,
in a flash crushing its quarry, so should the
stroke be timed.</p>
<p>Wherefore the spirit of the good fighter
is terrifying, his occasions sudden; like the
stretched cross-bow, whose string is released
at the touch of the trigger.</p>
<p>In the maze and tumult of the battle,
there is no confusion; in the thick of action
the battle array is impenetrable.</p>
<p>If discipline be perfect, disorder can be
simulated; if truly bold, we can feign fear;
if really strong, we can feign weakness.</p>
<p>We simulate disorder by subdivision;
fear, by spirit; weakness, by battle formation.</p>
<p>We set the enemy in motion by adopting
different formations to which he must
conform.</p>
<p>If we offer the enemy a point of
advantage, he will certainly take it: we
give him an advantage, set him in motion
and then fall upon him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>Wherefore the good fighter seeks victory
from spirit, and does not depend entirely
upon the skill of his men. He is careful
in his choice, and leaves the rest to battle
force; yet, when an opening or advantage
shows, he pushes it to its limits.</p>
<p>As a log or rock which, motionless on
flat ground, yet moves with ever-increasing
force when set on an incline, so await the
opportunity, and so act when the opportunity
arrives.</p>
<p>If the general be skilful, the spirit of his
troops is as the impetus of a round stone
rolled from the top of a high mountain.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<h2><a id="suntzu_VI">VI</a><br>
EMPTINESS AND STRENGTH</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>To be the first in the field, and there to
await the enemy, is to husband strength.</p>
<p>To be late, and hurrying to advance to
meet the foe, is exhausting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>The good fighter contrives to make the
enemy approach; he does not allow himself
to be beguiled by the enemy.</p>
<p>By offering an apparent advantage, he
induces the enemy to take up a position
that will cause his defeat; he plants obstructions
to dissuade him from acting in
such a way as to threaten his own dispositions.</p>
<p>If the enemy be at rest in comfortable
quarters, harass him; if he be living in
plenty, cut off his supplies; if sitting
composedly awaiting attack, cause him to
move.</p>
<p>This may be done by appearing where
the enemy is not, and assaulting unexpected
points.</p>
<p>If we go where the enemy is not, we may
go a thousand leagues without exhaustion.</p>
<p>If we attack those positions which the
enemy has not defended, we invariably take
them: but on the defence we must be
strong, even where we are not likely to
be attacked.</p>
<p>Against those skilful in attack, the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
does not know where to defend: against
those skilful in defence, the enemy does
not know where to attack.</p>
<p>Now the secrets of the art of offence are
not to be easily apprehended, as a certain
shape or noise can be understood, of the
senses; but when these secrets are once
learnt, the enemy is mastered.</p>
<p>We attack, and the enemy cannot resist,
because we attack his insufficiency; we
retire, and the enemy cannot pursue,
because we retire too quickly.</p>
<p>Again, when we are anxious to fight, but
the enemy is serenely secure behind high
walls and deep moats; we attack some
such other place that he must certainly
come out to relieve.</p>
<p>When we do not want to fight, we
occupy an unfortified line; and prevent the
enemy from attacking by keeping him in
suspense.</p>
<p>By making feints, and causing the enemy
to be uncertain as to our movements, we
unite, whilst he must divide.</p>
<p>We become one body; the enemy being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
separated into ten parts. We attack the
divided ten with the united one. We are
many, the enemy is few, and in superiority
of numbers there is economy of strength.</p>
<p>The place selected for attack must be
kept secret. If the enemy know not
where he will be attacked, he must prepare
in every quarter, and so be everywhere
weak.</p>
<p>If the enemy strengthen his front, he
must weaken his rear; if he strengthen
his right, his left is weakened; and if he
strengthen his left, his right is weakened.</p>
<p>Everywhere to make preparations, is to be
everywhere weak. The enemy is weakened
by his extended preparations, and we gain
in strength.</p>
<p>Having decided on the place and day
of attack, though the enemy be a hundred
leagues away, we can defeat him.</p>
<p>If the ground and occasion be not known,
the front cannot help the rear; the left
cannot support the right, nor the right the
left, nor the rear the front. For on occasion,
the parts of the army are two score<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
leagues apart, while a distance of four or
five leagues is comparatively close.</p>
<p>The soldiers of Wu<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10">[10]</a> are less than the
soldiers of Yueh; but as superiority in
numbers does not of necessity bring victory,
I say, then, that we may obtain the victory.</p>
<p>If the enemy be many in number, prevent
him from taking advantage of his
superiority, and ascertain his plan of operations.
Provoke the enemy and discover
the state of his troops; feint and discover
the strength of his position. Flap the
wings, and unmask his sufficiency or insufficiency.
By constant feints and excursions,
we may produce on the enemy an
impression of intangibility, which neither
spies nor art can dispel.</p>
<p>The general makes his plans in accordance
with the dispositions of the enemy,
and puts his hosts in motion; but the
multitude cannot appreciate the general’s
intention; they see the signs of victory, but
they cannot discover the means.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>If a victory be gained by a certain
stratagem, do not repeat it. Vary the
stratagem according to circumstances.</p>
<p>An army may be likened to water.</p>
<p>Water leaves dry the high places, and
seeks the hollows. An army turns from
strength and attacks emptiness.</p>
<p>The flow of water is regulated by the
shape of the ground; victory is gained by
acting in accordance with the state of the
enemy.</p>
<p>The shape of water is indeterminate;
likewise the spirit of war is not fixed.</p>
<p>The leader who changes his tactics in
accordance with his adversary, and thereby
controls the issue, may be called the God
of war.</p>
<p>Among the five elements<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11">[11]</a> there is no
settled precedence; the four seasons come

BATTLE TACTICS</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>For the most part, military procedure
is as follows:—</p>
<p>The general receives orders from his
lord; assembles and settles harmony
among the forces, and takes the field.</p>
<p>There is nothing more difficult than
Battle Tactics. Their difficulty lies in the
calculation of time and distance, and the
reversal of misfortune.</p>
<p>To make the enemy take a circuitous
route by a show of gain, and then, whilst
starting after him, to arrive before him, is
to be a master of the art of manœuvre.</p>
<p>The operations of an army may reap
advantage; the wrangles of a multitude
are fraught with peril.</p>
<p>Employing our whole force at one time
in order to gain advantage over the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
we may not have time enough to gain our
object. If we push on with a portion of the
force only, the transport is lost. Discarding
helmet and armour; stopping neither day
nor night; marching double distance; doing
double work; and finally contending with
the enemy at a distance of a hundred
leagues: results in the loss of the general.
Since the strong men arrive first, and the
tired drop in rear, only one-tenth of the
forces is available.</p>
<p>A forced march of fifty leagues to secure
an advantage may result in failure to the
leader of the vanguard, for only half his
men will arrive.</p>
<p>After a forced march of thirty leagues
to secure an advantage, only two-thirds of
the army will be available.</p>
<p>Further, a lack of ammunition, of supplies,
or of stores, may lead to disaster.</p>
<p>The ruler who is ignorant of the designs
of neighbouring princes, cannot treat with
them.</p>
<p>He who is ignorant of mountain and
forest, defile and marsh, cannot lead an army.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>He who does not employ a guide, cannot
gain advantage from the ground.</p>
<p>Disguise your movements; await a favourable
opportunity; divide or unite according
to circumstance.</p>
<p>Let your attack be swift as the wind;
your march calm like the forest;<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12">[12]</a> your
occupation devastating as fire. In defence,
as a mountain rest firm; like darkness impenetrable
to the enemy. Let your movements
be swift as the lightning.</p>
<p>Let as many as possible take part in the
plunder: distribute the profit from the
captured territory.</p>
<p>So he who understands the crooked and
the straight way conquers.</p>
<p>These are the methods of Battle Tactics.</p>
<p>According to the ancient books on war,
the drum and bell are used, because the
voice does not carry; the flag is used to
assist the sight. The use of bell, drum,
banner and flag is to attract the united
attention of eye and ear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>When all are united, the strong are not
left to go forward alone, the cowardly are
not free to retreat unrestricted. In this
way can a multitude be used.</p>
<p>Therefore in night fighting, beacons and
drums are largely used; in day fighting, a
great number of banners and flags and the
enemy’s eyes and ears are confounded.</p>
<p>We thus awe his army, and defeat his
general’s ambition.</p>
<p>In the morning the spirits are keen; at
midday there is a laziness; in the evening
a desire to return. Wherefore, he who
uses his soldiers well, avoids the time when
the spirits are keen; but attacks the enemy
when he is languid or seeking his camp.</p>
<p>Thus should the nature of energy be
turned to account.</p>
<p>To oppose confusion with order, clamour
with quiet, is to have the heart under
control.</p>
<p>To await an enemy from a distance, to
oppose hunger with satiety, rest with fatigue,
is the way to husband strength.</p>
<p>Do not attack where lines of banners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
wave, nor the serried ranks of battle spread,
but patiently await your time.</p>
<p>Do not attack an enemy on high ground,
nor one who has high ground at his back.
Do not pursue an enemy who is imitating
flight; do not attack a spirited enemy.</p>
<p>If the enemy offer an allurement, do
not take it.</p>
<p>Do not interfere with an enemy who has
struck camp, and is about to retire. When
surrounding an enemy, allow him an outlet.
Do not press a desperate enemy.</p>
<p>These are the methods of employing troops.</p>

THE NINE CHANGES</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>In general, the procedure of war is:—the
Leader, having received orders from
his lord, assembles the armies.</p>
<p>Do not camp on marshy or low-lying
ground; enter into friendly relations with
neighbouring states; do not linger in a far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
country; use stratagem in mountainous and
wooded country; on death ground, fight.</p>
<p>There are always roads that must be
avoided; forces that must not be attacked;
castles that must not be besieged; ground
that must not be chosen for encounter;
orders from the lord that must not be
obeyed.</p>
<p>The general who knows the Nine Changes
understands the use of troops; on the contrary,
he who does not understand them, can
make no use of his topographical knowledge.</p>
<p>In the management of armies, if the art
of the Nine Changes be understood, a knowledge
of the Five Advantages is of no avail.</p>
<p>The wise man considers well both advantage
and disadvantage. He sees a way out
of adversity, and on the day of victory to
danger is not blind.</p>
<p>In reducing an enemy to submission,
inflict all possible damage upon him; make
him undertake useless adventures; also
make neighbouring rulers move as you
would desire them by tempting them with
gain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>Wherefore in the conduct of war do not
depend on the enemy’s not coming, but
rely on your own preparations; do not
count on the enemy not attacking your
fortress, but leave nothing undefended.</p>
<p>Generals must be on their guard against
these five dangerous faults:—</p>
<p>Blind impetuosity, which leads to death.</p>
<p>Over-cautiousness, which leads to capture.</p>
<p>Quick temper, which brings insult.</p>
<p>A too rigid propriety, which invites disgrace.</p>
<p>Over-regard for the troops, which causes
inconvenience.</p>
<p>These five faults in the leader are disastrous
in war. The overthrow of the army
and the slaughter of the general arise from
them. Therefore they must be carefully
considered.</p>

MOVEMENT OF TROOPS</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>Touching the disposal of troops and
observation of the enemy in relation to
mountain warfare:—</p>
<p>Cross mountains and camp in valleys,
selecting positions of safety.</p>
<p>Place the army on high ground, and avoid
an enemy in high places.</p>
<p>In relation to water:—</p>
<p>After crossing waters, pass on immediately
to a distance. When the enemy is crossing
a stream, do not meet and engage him in
the waters, but strike when half his force
has passed over. Do not advance on an
enemy near water, but place the army on
high ground, and in safety.</p>
<p>Do not fight when the enemy is between
the army and the source of the river.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>With regard to marshes:—</p>
<p>Cross salty marshes quickly; do not linger
near them.</p>
<p>If by chance compelled to fight in the
neighbourhood of a marsh, seek a place
where there is water and grass, and trees in
plenty in the rear.</p>
<p>In open country place the army in a convenient
place with rising ground in the right
rear; so that while in front lies death, behind
there is safety.</p>
<p>Such is war in flat country.</p>
<p>Huangti, by observing these things, gained
the victory over four Princes.</p>
<p>As a rule, the soldiers prefer high ground
to low. They prefer sunny places to those
the sun does not reach.</p>
<p>If the health of the troops be considered,
and they are encamped on high and sunny
ground, diseases will be avoided, and victory
made certain.</p>
<p>If there be rising ground, encamp on its
sunny side and in front of it; for thereby
the soldiers are benefited, and the ground
used to our advantage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>If, owing to rains in the upper reaches,
the river become turbulent, do not cross
until the waters have quieted.</p>
<p>Steep and impassable valleys; well-like
places; confined places; tangled impenetrable
ground; swamps and bogs; narrow
passages with pitfalls:—quickly pass from
these, and approach them not. Cause the
enemy to approach near to them, but
keep yourself from these places; face
them, so that the enemy has them in his
rear.</p>
<p>If there be near to the army, precipices,
ponds, meres, reeds and rushes, or thick
forests and trees, search them thoroughly.
These are places where the enemy is likely
to be in ambush.</p>
<p>When the enemy is close, but quiet, he is
strong in reliance on natural defences.</p>
<p>If the enemy challenge to fight from afar,
he wishes you to advance.</p>
<p>If the enemy be encamped in open
country, it is with some special object in
view.</p>
<p>Movement among the trees shows that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the enemy is advancing. Broken branches
and trodden grass, as of the passing of a
large host, must be regarded with suspicion.</p>
<p>The rising of birds shows an ambush.</p>
<p>Startled beasts show that the enemy is
stealthily approaching from several sides.</p>
<p>High, straight spurts of dust betoken
that chariots are coming.</p>
<p>Long, low masses of dust show the
coming of infantry.</p>
<p>Here and there, thin and high columns
of dust are signs that firewood and fodder
are being collected.</p>
<p>Small clouds of dust moving to and fro
are signs that the enemy is preparing to
encamp for a short time.</p>
<p>Busy preparations and smooth words
show that the enemy is about to advance
to attack.</p>
<p>Big words, and the spurring forward of
horsemen, are signs that the enemy is about
to retire.</p>
<p>An advance of the light chariots to the
flanks of the camp is a sign that the enemy
is coming forth to fight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>Without consultation, suddenly to desire
an armistice, is a mark of ulterior design.</p>
<p>The passing to and fro of messengers,
and the forming up of troops, show that the
enemy has some movement on foot.</p>
<p>An advance, followed by sudden retirement,
is a lure to attack.</p>
<p>When the enemy use their weapons to
rest upon, they are hungry.</p>
<p>If the drawers of water drink at the river,
the enemy is suffering from thirst.</p>
<p>Disregard of booty that lies ready at hand
is a sign of exhaustion.</p>
<p>The clustering of birds round a position
shows that it is unoccupied.</p>
<p>Voices calling in the night betoken alarm.</p>
<p>Disorder in the army is a sign that the
general is disregarded.</p>
<p>A changing about of flags and banners
is a sign that the army is unsettled.</p>
<p>If the officers be angry, it is because the
soldiers are tired, <i>and slow to obey</i>.</p>
<p>The killing of horses for food shows that
the enemy is short of provisions.</p>
<p>When the cooking-pots are hung up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the wall and the soldiers turn not in again,
the enemy is at an end of his resources.</p>
<p>Exceeding graciousness and familiarity
on the part of the general show that he
has lost the confidence of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Frequent rewards show that discipline is
at an end.</p>
<p>Frequent punishments are a sign that the
general is in difficulties.</p>
<p>The general who first blusters, and then
is obsequious, is without perception.</p>
<p>He who offers apologies and hostages
is anxious for a truce.</p>
<p>When both sides, eager for a fight, face
each other for a considerable time, neither
advancing nor retiring, the occasion requires
the utmost vigilance and circumspection.</p>
<p>Numbers are no certain mark of strength.</p>
<p>Even if incapable of a headlong assault,
if the forces be united, and the enemy’s
condition ascertained, victory is possible.</p>
<p>He who without taking thought makes
light of the enemy is certain to be captured.</p>
<p>If a general who is strange to the troops
punish them, they cease to obey him. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
they are not obedient, they cannot be
usefully employed.</p>
<p>If the troops know the general, but are not
affected by his punishments, they are useless.</p>
<p>By humane treatment we obtain obedience;
authority brings uniformity. Thus
we obtain victory.</p>
<p>If the people have been trained in obedience
from the beginning, they respect their
leader’s commands.</p>
<p>If the people be not early trained to
obedience, they do not respect their leader’s
commands.</p>
<p>Orders are always obeyed, if general and
soldiers are in sympathy.</p>

<h2><a id="suntzu_X">X</a><br>
GROUND</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>With regard to the different natures of
ground there are:—</p>
<p>Open ground; broken ground; suspended
ground; defiles; precipices; far countries.</p>
<p>Open ground is that where either side has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
liberty of movement: be quick to occupy
any high ground in the neighbourhood and
consider well the line of supplies.</p>
<p>Broken ground. Advance is easy, but
retreat from it is difficult. Here, if the
enemy be not prepared, we may win: but
should he be prepared, and defeat us, and
retreat be impossible, then there is disaster.</p>
<p>Suspended ground. The side that takes
the initiative is under a disadvantage.
Here, if the enemy offer some allurement,
we should not advance: but rather, by
feigning retreat, wait until he has put forth
half his force. Then we may attack him
with advantage.</p>
<p>Defiles, make haste to occupy; garrison
strongly and await the enemy. Should the
enemy be before you, and in strength, do
not engage him; but if there be unoccupied
points, attack him.</p>
<p>In precipitous ground quickly occupy
a position on a sunny height, and await
the enemy. If the enemy be before you,
withdraw and do not attack him.</p>
<p>If distant from the enemy, and the forces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be equal, to take the initiative is disadvantageous.</p>
<p>Now, these are the six kinds of ground.
It is the duty of generals to study them.</p>
<p>Again, there are six calamities among the
troops, arising, not from defect of ground, or
lack of opportunity, but from the general’s
incapacity.</p>
<p>These are: repulse, relaxation, distress,
disorganisation, confusion and rout.</p>
<p>If troops be sent to attack an enemy of
equal quality, but ten times their number,
they retire discomfited.</p>
<p>Strong soldiers with weak officers cause
relaxation.</p>
<p>Able officers with feeble soldiers cause
distress.</p>
<p>Enraged senior officers, who fall upon the
enemy without orders, and obey not the
general because he does not recognise their
abilities, produce disorganisation.</p>
<p>Weak and amiable generals, whose directions
and leadership are vague, whose
officers’ and men’s duties are not fixed,
and whose dispositions are contradictory,
produce confusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>Generals, who are unable to estimate the
enemy, who oppose small numbers to large,
weakness to strength, and who do not put
picked men in the van of the army, cause
it to be routed.</p>
<p>These six things lead to defeat. It is the
duty of the general to study them carefully.</p>
<p>Ground is the handmaid of victory.</p>
<p>Ability to estimate the enemy, and plan
the victory; an eye for steepness, command
and distances: these are the qualities of the
good general.</p>
<p>Whosoever knows these things, conquers;
he who understands them not, is defeated.</p>
<p>If victory be certain from the military
standpoint, fight, even if the lord forbid.</p>
<p>If defeat be certain from the military
standpoint, do not fight, even though the
lord commands it.</p>
<p>The general who advances, from no
thought of his own glory, or retires, regardless
of punishment; but only strives for
the people’s welfare, and his lord’s advantage,
is a treasure to the state.</p>
<p>The good general cares for his soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and lovingly treats them as his children;
as a consequence they follow him through
deep valleys, and are beside him in death.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, over-care for the soldiers
may cause disobedience; over-attention may
make them unserviceable; over-indulgence
may produce disorder: they become like
spoilt children, and cannot be used.</p>
<p>He who is confident of his own men, but
is ignorant that the enemy should not be
attacked, has no certainty of victory.</p>
<p>He who knows that the enemy may be
attacked with advantage, but knows not
his own men, has no certainty of victory.</p>
<p>Confidence in the troops, right judgment
when to attack the enemy, but ignorance
of the ground, bring uncertain victory.</p>
<p>The wise soldier, once in motion, does
not waver, and is never at a loss.</p>
<p>As has been said: “Know thyself; know
the enemy; fear not for victory.”</p>
<p>Also, if the season and the opportunity
be realised, and the ground known, complete
victory is certain.</p>

THE NINE GROUNDS</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>In respect to the conduct of war there
are:—</p>
<p>Distracting ground; disturbing ground;
ground of contention; intersecting ground;
path-ridden ground; deeply-involved ground;
difficult ground; enclosed ground; death
ground.</p>
<p>At all times, when the prince fights in his
own territory, it is called distracting<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13">[13]</a> ground.</p>
<p>That ground a short way inside the enemy’s
border is called disturbing ground.</p>
<p>Ground giving advantage to whichever
side is in possession, is called ground of
contention.</p>
<p>Ground to which either side has access,
is called intersecting ground.</p>
<p>Ground between three provinces first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
possession of which enables the peoples of
the earth to be controlled, is called path-ridden
ground.</p>
<p>The interior of the enemy’s country with
many of his fortified towns in rear, is called
deeply-involved ground.</p>
<p>Mountain and forest, precipices, ravines,
marsh and swamp, all places where passage
is hard, are called difficult ground.</p>
<p>A narrow entrance and winding outlet,
where a small number can oppose a large
force, is called enclosed ground.</p>
<p>That ground where delay means disaster,
is called death ground.</p>
<p>Wherefore, do not fight on distracting
ground; do not linger on disturbing ground.</p>
<p>If the enemy be in possession of disputed
ground, do not attack.</p>
<p>In intersecting ground, do not interrupt
the highways.</p>
<p>At the crossing of highways, cultivate
intercourse.</p>
<p>When deeply involved, levy and store
up the enemy’s property.</p>
<p>Quickly depart from difficult ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>
<p>On enclosed ground, use stratagem.</p>
<p>On death ground, fight.</p>
<p>The skilful fighters of old were at pains
to disconnect the enemy’s front and rear;
they cut asunder small and large forces of
the enemy; prevented mutual help between
his officers and men; spread mistrust
between high and low. They scattered the
enemy, and prevented him from concentrating;
if his soldiers were assembled, they
were without unity.</p>
<p>If there be a chance of victory, move; if
there be no chance of success, stand fast.</p>
<p>If I were asked how a powerful and
united force of the enemy should be met,
I would say: lay hands on what the enemy
cherishes and he will conform to our desires.</p>
<p>In war, above all, speed sustains the
spirit of the troops. Strike before the
enemy is ready; and attack his unpreparedness
from an unexpected quarter.</p>
<p>With regard to war in foreign lands.
When strangers in a far country the soldiers
are united and are proof against defeat.
Plunder fertile plains so that the army is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
fed; be careful of the health of the soldiers;
do not tire them uselessly; unite their
minds; store up strength; plan well and
secretly. If there be no refuge the soldiers
will not fly from death.</p>
<p>If there be no alternative but death, the
soldiers exert themselves to the utmost.</p>
<p>In desperate places, soldiers lose the sense
of fear.</p>
<p>If there be no place of refuge, there
will be no wavering.</p>
<p>If deeply involved in the enemy’s country,
there is unity.</p>
<p>If it be unavoidable, the soldiers will
fight their hardest. Even without warnings
they are vigilant; they comply without
insistence; without stipulations they are
tractable; without explicit instructions they
will trust the general and obey him.</p>
<p>Prohibit the discussion of signs and
omens, and remove the soldiers’ doubts;
then to the moment of death they will be
undistracted.</p>
<p>Riches are denied the soldiers, not because
money is a bad thing; old age is forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
them, but not because long life is evil.
Hardships and danger are the proper lot
of the soldier.</p>
<p>When the order for attack is given, the
collars of those who are sitting may be wet
with tears; tears may roll down the cheeks
of those reclining; yet these men, in a
desperate place, will fight with the courage
of Chu and Kuei.</p>
<p>Soldiers should be used like the snakes on
Mt. Chang; which, if you hit on the head,
the tail will strike you; if you hit the tail,
the head will strike you; if you strike its
middle, head and tail will strike you
together.</p>
<p>Should any one ask me whether men
can be made to move like these snakes,
I say, yes. The men of Wu and Yueh
hate each other; yet, if they cross a river
in the same boat and a storm overtake
them, they help each other like the two
hands.</p>
<p>The horses may be tied, and the chariot
wheels sunk in the mud; but that does not
prevent flight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Universal courage and unity depend on
good management.</p>
<p>The best results from both the weak and
strong are obtained by a proper use of the
ground.</p>
<p>The skilful warrior can lead his army, as
a man leads another by the hand, because
he places it in a desperate position.</p>
<p>The general should be calm, inscrutable,
just and prudent. He should keep his
officers and men in ignorance of his plans,
and inform no one of any changes or fresh
departures. By changing his camps, and
taking devious and unexpected routes, his
plans cannot be guessed.</p>
<p>As one taking away the ladder from under
those mounted upon the roof, so acts the
general when his men are assembled to fight.
He penetrates into the heart of the enemy’s
country and then divulges his plans. He
drives the army hither and thither like a
flock of sheep, knowing not whither they go.</p>
<p>Therefore the general should assemble
the armies, and place them in a desperate
position.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>The different natures of the Nine Grounds;
the suiting of the means to the occasion;
the hearts of men: these are things that
must be studied.</p>
<p>When deep in the interior of a hostile
country, there is cohesion; if only on the
borders, there is distraction. To leave home
and cross the borders is to be free from
interference.</p>
<p>On distracting ground, unite the soldiers’
minds.</p>
<p>On disturbing ground, keep together.</p>
<p>On disputed ground, try to take the
enemy in rear.</p>
<p>On intersecting ground, look well to the
defences.</p>
<p>On path-ridden ground, cultivate intercourse.</p>
<p>On deeply-involved ground be careful
of supplies.</p>
<p>On difficult ground, do not linger.</p>
<p>On enclosed ground, close the path of
escape.</p>
<p>On death ground, show the soldiers that
there is no chance of survival.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>It is the nature of soldiers to defend when
surrounded, to fight with energy when compelled
thereto, to pursue the enemy if he
retreat.</p>
<p>He cannot treat with other rulers who
knows not their ambitions.</p>
<p>He who knows not mountain and forest;
cliffs; ravines; lakes and marshes; cannot
conduct an army.</p>
<p>He who does not use guides, cannot take
advantage of the ground.</p>
<p>He who has not a complete knowledge
of the Nine Grounds, cannot gain military
dominion.</p>
<p>The great general, when attacking a
powerful nation, prevents the enemy from
concentrating his hosts.</p>
<p>He overawes the enemy so that other
states cannot join against him.</p>
<p>He does not struggle for the favour of
other states; nor is he careful of their
rights. He has confidence in himself, and
awes the enemy.</p>
<p>Therefore he easily takes the fortress, or
reduces the country to subjection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>In the bestowal of rewards, or in
his orders, he is not bound by ancient
rule.</p>
<p>He manages his forces as though they
were one man.</p>
<p>Orders should direct the soldiers; but
while what is advantageous should be made
known, what is disadvantageous should be
concealed.</p>
<p>If the forces be plunged into danger,
there is survival; from death ground there
is retrieval; for the force in danger gains
the victory.</p>
<p>Discover the enemy’s intentions by conforming
to his movements. When these
are discovered, then, with one stroke, the
general may be killed, even though he
be one hundred leagues distant.</p>
<p>When war is declared, close the barriers;
destroy passports; prevent the passage of
the enemy’s spies; conduct the business
of the government with vigilance.</p>
<p>Take immediate advantage of the enemy’s
weakness; discover what he most values,
and plan to seize it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>Shape your plans according to rule, and
the circumstances of the enemy.</p>
<p>At first behave with the discretion of a
maiden; then, when the enemy gives an
opening, dart in like a rabbit.</p>
<p>The enemy cannot defend himself.</p>

ASSAULT BY FIRE</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>There are five ways of attack by fire:</p>
<p>The first is called barrack burning; the
second, commissariat burning; the third,
equipment burning; the fourth, store burning;
the fifth, the company burning.</p>
<p>The moment for the fire assault must
be suitable. Further, appliances must
always be kept at hand.</p>
<p>There is a time and day proper for the
setting and carrying out of the fire assault;
namely: such time as the weather is dry;
and a day when the moon is in the quarters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the stars Chi, Pi, I, Chen: for these
are days of wind.</p>
<p>Regard well the developments that will
certainly arise from the fire, and act upon
them. When fire breaks out inside the
enemy’s camp, thrust upon him with all
speed from without; but if his soldiers be
quiet, wait, and do not attack.</p>
<p>When the fire is at its height, attack or
not, as opportunity may arise.</p>
<p>If the opportunity be favourable, set fire
to the enemy’s camp, and do not wait for
it to break out from within.</p>
<p>When fire breaks out on the windward
side, do not attack from the leeward.</p>
<p>Wind that rises in the day lasts long.
Wind that rises in the night time quickly

<p>The peculiarities of the five burnings
must be known, and the calendar studied,
and, if the attack is to be assisted, the fire
must be unquenchable.</p>
<p>If water is to assist the attack, the flood
must be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Water may isolate or divide the enemy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
fire may consume his camp; but unless
victory or possession be obtained, the enemy
quickly recovers, and misfortunes arise. The
war drags on, and money is spent.</p>
<p>Let the enlightened lord consider well;
and the good general keep the main object
in view. If no advantage is to be gained
thereby, do not move; without prospect of
victory, do not use the soldiers; do not
fight unless the state be in danger.</p>
<p>War should not be undertaken because
the lord is in a moment of passion. The
general must not fight because there is
anger in his heart.</p>
<p>Do not make war unless victory may be
gained thereby; if there be prospect of
victory, move; if there be no prospect,
do not move.</p>
<p>For passion may change to gladness,
anger passes away; but a country, once
overturned, cannot be restored; the dead
cannot be brought to life.</p>
<p>Wherefore it is written, the enlightened
lord is circumspect, and the good general
takes heed; then is the state secure, and
the army victorious in battle.</p>

<h2><a id="suntzu_XIII">XIII</a><br>
THE EMPLOYMENT OF SPIES</h2>
<p>Sun the Master said:—</p>
<p>Calling 100,000 men to arms, and transporting
them a hundred leagues, is such
an undertaking that in one day 1,000 taels
of the citizens’ and nobles’ money are spent;
commotions arise within and without the
state; carriers fall down exhausted on the
line of march of the army; and the occupations
of 700,000<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14">[14]</a> homes are upset.</p>
<p>Again, for years the armies may face each
other; yet the issue may depend on a
single day’s victory.</p>
<p>Wherefore, by grudging slight expense
in titles and salaries to spies, to remain in
ignorance of the enemy’s circumstances, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
to be without humanity. Such a person
is no general; he is no assistance to his
lord; he is no master of victory.</p>
<p>The enlightened ruler and the wise
general who act, win, and are distinguished
beyond the common, are informed beforehand.</p>
<p>This knowledge is not to be got by calling
on gods and demons; nor does it come
of past experience nor calculation. It is
through men that knowledge of the enemy
is gained.</p>
<p>Now the five kinds of spies are these:
village spies, inner spies, converted spies,
death spies, living spies.</p>
<p>If these five means be employed simultaneously,
none can discover their working.
This is called the Mysterious Thread: it is
the Lord’s Treasure.</p>
<p>Village spies are such people of the
country as give information.</p>
<p>Inner spies are those of the enemy’s
officials employed by us.</p>
<p>Converted spies are those of the enemy’s
spies in our pay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Death<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15">[15]</a> spies are sent to misinform the
enemy, and to spread false reports through
our spies already in the enemy’s lines.</p>
<p>Living spies<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16">[16]</a> return to report.</p>
<p>In connection with the armies, spies
should be treated with the greatest kindness;
and in dealing out reward, they
should receive the most generous treatment.
All matters relating to spies are secret.</p>
<p>Without infinite capacity in the general,
the employment of spies is impossible.
Their treatment requires benevolence and
uprightness. Except they be observed with
the closest attention, the truth will not be
obtained from them.</p>
<p>Wonderful indeed is the power of spies.</p>
<p>There is no occasion when they cannot
be used.</p>
<p>If a secret matter be spoken of before
the time is ripe, the spy who told the
matter, and the man who repeated the
same, should be put to death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>If desirous of attacking an army; of
besieging a fortress; or of killing a certain
person; first of all, learn the names of the
general in charge; of his right-hand<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17">[17]</a> men;
of those who introduce visitors to the
Presence; of the gate keeper and the
sentries. Then set the spies to watch them.</p>
<p>Seek out the enemy’s spies who come to
spy on us; give them money; cause them
to be lodged and cared for; and convert
them to the service. Through them we
are enabled to obtain spies among the
enemy’s villagers and officials.</p>
<p>By means of the converted spy, we can
construct a false story for the death spy
to carry to the enemy.</p>
<p>It is through the converted spy that we
are able to use the five varieties, to their
utmost advantage; therefore he must be
liberally treated.</p>
<p>In ancient times the rise to power of
the province of Yin was due to Ichih,
who was sent to the country of Hsia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Likewise during the foundation of the state
of Chu, Luya lived among the people of
Shang.</p>
<p>Wherefore, intelligent rulers and wise
generals use the cleverest men as spies,
and invariably acquire great merit. The
spy is a necessity to the army. Upon him
the movement of the army depends.</p>

<h2> <a id="THE_SAYINGS_OF_WUTZU">THE SAYINGS OF WUTZU</a></h2>
<h2> <a id="wutzu_INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Now Wu, albeit clothed in the raiment
of a scholar, was a man skilled in the art
of war.</p>
<p>And Wen, Lord of Wei, came unto
him and said:—</p>
<p>“I am a man of peace, caring not for
military affairs.”</p>
<p>And Wu said:—</p>
<p>“Your actions are witnesses of your
mind; why do your words say not what is
in your heart?</p>
<p>“You do prepare and dress hides and
leather through the four seasons, ornamenting
them with red lacquer and the figures
of panthers and elephants; which give not
warmth in winter, neither in summer,
coolness. Moreover, you make halberds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
24<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18">[18]</a> feet long, and pikes 12 feet long, and
leather (covered) chariots so large as to fill
up the gateways, wheels with ornament,
and naves capped with leather. Now, these
are neither beautiful to the eye nor light
in the chase; I know not for what use
my lord makes these things.</p>
<p>“But, although provided with these
instruments of war, if the leader be not
competent, a brooding hen might as well
strike a badger, or a dog with young challenge
the tiger: the spirit of encounter may
be present, but there is no end but death.</p>
<p>“In ancient times, the Prince Chengsang
cultivated virtue, and put away military
things, and his kingdom fell.</p>
<p>“The Prince Yuhu put his trust in
numbers, and delighted in war and was
driven from the throne.</p>
<p>“Therefore the enlightened ruler should
ponder over these things; encourage learning
and virtue in the kingdom, and be prepared
against war from without.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>“To hesitate before the enemy is not a
cause for righteousness; remorse for the
fallen is not true humanity.”</p>
<p>And when Lord Wen heard these words,
he himself spread a seat, and his wife
offered up a cup, and Wu was appointed
general before the altar.</p>
<p>Now, in the defence of Hsihe against
different states there were fought seventy-six
great fights, of which sixty-four were complete
victories, and the remainder undecided.
And the kingdom grew and stretched 1,000
leagues on every side, which was all due
to the virtue of Wu.</p>
<hr class="chap">
<h2><a id="wutzu_I">I</a><br>
THE GOVERNMENT OF A COUNTRY</h2>
<p>And Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>The mighty rulers of old first trained
their retainers, and then extended their
regard to their outlying feudatories.</p>
<p>There are four discords:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>Discord in the state: then never make war.</p>
<p>Discord in the army: then do not strike
camp.</p>
<p>Discord in the camp: then do not advance
to attack.</p>
<p>Discord in the battle array: then seek
not to decide the issue.</p>
<p>Therefore, wise rulers who would employ
their subjects in great endeavours, should
first establish harmony among them.</p>
<p>Lend not a ready ear to human counsellors,
but lay the matter before the altar; seek
inside the turtle,<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19">[19]</a> and consider well the
time and season. Then, if all be well,
commit ourselves to the undertaking.</p>
<p>If the people know that their lord is careful
of their lives, and laments their death
beyond all else; then, in the time of danger,
the soldiers advance, and, advancing, find
glory in death; and in survival after retreat,
dishonour.</p>
<p>The Master said:—</p>
<p>The Way must follow the only true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
path: righteousness lies at the root of
achievement and merit.</p>
<p>The object of stratagem is to avoid loss
and gain advantage.</p>
<p>The object of government is to guard
enterprise and to preserve the state.</p>
<p>If conduct depart from the Way, and
the undertaking accord not with righteousness,
then disaster befalls the mighty.</p>
<p>Therefore, wise men maintain order by
keeping in the Way, and governing with
righteousness; they move with discretion,
and with benevolence they make the people
amenable.</p>
<p>If these four virtues be practised, there
is prosperity; if they be neglected, there
is decay.</p>
<p>For, when Lord Tang of Cheng defeated
Lord Chieh, the people of Hsia rejoiced,
and when Wu of Chou defeated Lord
Chou, the people of Yin were not discomfited.
And this was because it was
ordained by Providence and human desire.</p>
<p>The Master said:—</p>
<p>In the government of a country and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
command of an army, the inculcation of
propriety, stimulation of righteousness, and
the promotion of a sense of shame are
required.</p>
<p>When men possess a sense of shame,
they will attack with resolution when in
strength, and when few in number defend
to the last.</p>
<p>But while victory is easy in attack, it
is difficult in defence.</p>
<p>Now, of the fighting races below heaven;
those who gained five victories have been
worn out; those who have won four victories
have been impoverished; three victories
have given dominion; two victories have
founded a kingdom; and upon one victory
an empire has been established.</p>
<p>For those who have gained power on
earth by many victories are few; and those
who have lost it, many.</p>
<p>The Master said:—</p>
<p>The causes of war are five:—</p>
<p>First, ambition; second, profit; third,
overburdened hate; fourth, internal disorder;
fifth, famine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>Again, the natures of war are five:—</p>
<p>First, a righteous war; second, a war of
might; third, a war of revenge; fourth, a
war of tyranny; fifth, an unrighteous war.</p>
<p>The prevention of tyranny and the restoration
of order is just; to strike in reliance
on numbers is oppression; to raise the
standard for reasons of anger is a war of
revenge; to quit propriety, and seize advantage
is tyranny; when the state is disordered
and the people worn out, to harbour
designs, and set a multitude in motion, is
a war of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>There is a way of overcoming each of
these five.</p>
<p>Righteousness is overcome by propriety;
might by humanity; revenge by words;
tyranny by deception; unrighteousness by
strategy.</p>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“I would know the way to control an
army, to measure men, and make the
country strong.”</p>
<p>Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“The enlightened rulers of antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
respected propriety between sovereign and
people; established etiquette between high
and low; settled officials and citizens in close
accord; gave instruction in accordance with
custom; selected men of ability, and thereby
provided against what should come to pass.</p>
<p>“In ancient times, Prince Huan of Chi
assembled 50,000 men at arms, and became
chief among the princes; Prince Wen of
Chin put 40,000 mighty men in the van,
and gained his ambition; Prince Mu of
Chin gathered together 30,000 invincibles,
and subdued his neighbouring foes. Wherefore,
the princes of powerful states must
consider their people, and assemble the
valiant and spirited men by companies.</p>
<p>“Those who delight to attack, and to
display their valour and fealty should be
formed in companies.</p>
<p>“Those skilful in scaling heights, or
covering long distances, and who are quick
and light of foot must be collected in
companies.</p>
<p>“Retainers who have lost their rank, and
who are desirous of displaying their prowess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
before their superiors should be gathered
into companies.</p>
<p>“Those who have abandoned a castle, or
deserted their trust, and are desirous of
atoning for their misconduct, should be
collected and formed into companies.</p>
<p>“These five bodies form the flower of the
army. With 3,000 of such troops, if they
issue from within, an encompassing enemy
can be burst asunder; if they enter from
without, a castle can be overthrown.”</p>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“I desire to know how to fix the battle
array, render defence secure, and attack
with certainty of victory.”</p>
<p>Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“To see with the eye is better than ready
words. Yet, I say, if the wise men be put
in authority and the ignorant in low places,
then the army is already arranged.</p>
<p>“If the people be free from anxiety
about their estates, and love their officials,
then defence is already secure.</p>
<p>“If all the lieges be proud of their lord,
and think ill of neighbouring states, then
is the battle already won.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>The Lord Wen once assembled a number
of his subjects to discuss affairs of state:
and none could equal him in wisdom, and
when he left the council chamber his face
was pleased.</p>
<p>Then Wu advanced and said:—</p>
<p>In ancient times, Lord Chuang of Chu
once consulted with his lieges, and none were
like unto him in wisdom; and when the
Lord left the council chamber his countenance
was troubled. Then the Duke Shen
asked and said: “Why is my Lord
troubled?” And he answered: “I have
heard that the world is never without sages,
and that in every country there are wise
men; that good advisers are the foundation
of an empire; and friends of dominion.
Now, if I, lacking wisdom, have no equal
among the multitude of my officers, dangerous
indeed is the state of Chu. It grieves
me that whereas Prince Chuang of Chu
was troubled in a like case my Lord should
be pleased.”</p>
<p>And hearing this Lord Wen was inwardly
troubled.</p>

<h2><a id="wutzu_II">II</a><br>
ESTIMATION OF THE ENEMY</h2>
<p>And Lord Wen said to Wu:—</p>
<p>“Chin threatens us on the west; Chu
surrounds us on the south; Chao presses
us in the north; Chi watches us in the
east; Yen stops our rear, and Han is
posted in our front. Thus, the armies of
six nations encompass us on every side, and
our condition is very unpropitious. Canst
thou relieve my anxiety?”</p>
<p>Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“The path of safety of a state lies first
of all in vigilance. Now my Lord has
already taken warning, wherefore misfortunes
are yet distant.</p>
<p>“Let me state the habits of these six
countries. The forces of Chi are weighty
but without solidity; the soldiers of Chin
are scattered, and fight each of his own
accord: the army of Chu is well ordered,
but cannot endure: the soldiers of Yen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
defend well, but are without dash: the
armies of the three Chins are well governed,
but cannot be used.</p>
<p>“The nature of Chi is stubborn and the
country rich, but prince and officials are
proud and luxurious, and neglectful of the
common people; government is loose and
rewards not impartial; in one camp there
are two minds; the front is heavy, but the
rear is light. Therefore it is ponderous
without stability. To attack it, the force
must be divided into three parts, and, by
threatening it on three sides, its front can
be broken.</p>
<p>“The nature of Chin is strong, the
country rugged, and the government firm;
rewards and punishments just, the people
indomitable, and all have the fighting
spirit; wherefore, when separated, each
fights of his own accord.</p>
<p>“To defeat this people, they must first
be tempted by gain to leave their cause,
so that the soldiers, greedy of profit, desert
their general: then, taking advantage of
their disobedience, their scattered forces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
can be chased, ambushes laid, favourable
opportunities taken, and their general
captured.</p>
<p>“The nature of Chu is weak, its territory
wide, the government weak, and the people
exhausted; the troops are well ordered but
of short endurance.</p>
<p>“The way to defeat them is to assault
their camp, throw it into confusion and
crush their spirit, advance softly, and retire
quickly; tire them out, avoid a serious
encounter, and they may be defeated.</p>
<p>“The nature of Yen is straightforward;
its people are cautious, loving courage and
righteousness, and without guile; wherefore
they defend but are not daring.</p>
<p>“The way to defeat them is to draw
close and press them; tease them and pass
to a distance; move quickly, and appear in
the rear, thus causing bewilderment to their
officers and fear in their ranks. Our chariots
and horsemen will act with circumspection
and avoid encounter. Thus their general
can be captured.</p>
<p>“The three Chins are the middle king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>dom:
their nature is peaceful and their
rule just. Their people are tired of war;
their troops are trained, but their leaders
are despised; pay is small, and the soldiers
lack the spirit of sacrifice, thus they are well
governed but cannot be used.</p>
<p>“The way to defeat them is to threaten
them from afar. If a multitude attack—defend;
if they retreat—pursue, and tire
them out.</p>
<p>“In every army there are mighty warriors
with strength to lift the Censer, swifter
of foot than the war horse; who can take
the enemy’s standard, or slay his general.
If such men be selected, and set apart,
cared for and honoured, they are the life
of the army.</p>
<p>“Those who use the five arms<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20">[20]</a> with skill,
who are clever, strong and quick, and careless
of the enemy, should be given rank
and decoration, and used to decide the
victory. Their parents and families should
be cared for, encouraged by rewards, and
kept in fear of punishment. These men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
consolidate the battle array; their presence
causes endurance.</p>
<p>“If these men be well selected, double
their number can be defeated.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen said:—</p>
<p>“It is good!”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“In the estimation of the enemy there
are eight cases when, without consulting
the oracles, he may be attacked.</p>
<p>“First, an enemy who, in great wind and
cold, has risen early, started forth across ice
and rivers, and braved stress and hardships.</p>
<p>“Second, an enemy who, in the height of
summer, and in great heat, has risen early, has
travelled incessantly, is hungry and without
water, and is striving to reach a distance.</p>
<p>“Third, an enemy who has been encamped
long in one place, who is without
provisions, when the farmers are vexed
and indignant, who has suffered frequent
calamities, and whose officers are unable
to establish confidence.</p>
<p>“Fourth, when the enemy’s funds are
exhausted, fuel and fodder scarce; when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the heavens have been overcast by long
continued rain; when there is the desire to
loot, but no place to loot withal.</p>
<p>“Fifth, when their numbers are few;
when water is scarce; when men and horses
are scourged by pestilence, and from no
quarter is succour at hand.</p>
<p>“Sixth, when night falls, and the way is
yet far; when officers and men are worn
out and fearful, weary and without food, and
have laid aside their armour and are resting.</p>
<p>“Seventh, when the general’s authority is
weak, the officials false, and the soldiers
unsettled; when their army has been
alarmed, and no help is forthcoming.</p>
<p>“Eighth, when the battle formation is not
yet fixed, or camp pitched; when climbing
a hill, or passing through a difficult place;
when half is hidden and half exposed.</p>
<p>“An enemy in these situations may be
smitten without hesitation.</p>
<p>“There are six enemies, that, without
consulting oracles, should be avoided.</p>
<p>“First, wide and vast territories, and a
large and rich population.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>“Second, where the officials care for the
people, and bestow bountiful favours and
rewards.</p>
<p>“Third, where rewards are well deserved,
punishment accurately apportioned, and
operations undertaken only when the time
is fitting.</p>
<p>“Fourth, where merit is recognised and
given rank, wise men appointed, and ability
employed.</p>
<p>“Fifth, where the troops are many and
their weapons excellent.</p>
<p>“Sixth, when help is at hand on every
side, or from a powerful ally.</p>
<p>“For, if the enemy excel in the foregoing,
he must be avoided without hesitation. As
it is written, if it be judged good, advance;
if it be known to be difficult, retreat.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“I desire to know how the interior of
the enemy can be known from his outer
appearance; the form of his camp by
observing his advance, and how victory
may be determined?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>“If the coming of the enemy be reckless
like roaring waters, his banners and pennons
disordered, and horses and men frequently
looking behind, then ten can be struck with
one. Panic will certainly seize them.</p>
<p>“Before the various princes have
assembled, before harmony has been
established between lord and lieges, before
ditches have been dug, or regulations
established, and the army is alarmed;
wishing to advance, but unable; wishing
to retreat, but unable: then the force can
strike twice their numbers, and in a
hundred fights there is no fear of retreat.”</p>
<p>Lord Wen asked:—</p>
<p>“How can the enemy be certainly
defeated?”</p>
<p>Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“Make certain of the enemy’s real condition
and quickly strike his weak point;
strike an enemy who has just arrived from
afar, before his ranks are arranged; or one
who has eaten and has not completed his
dispositions; or an enemy who is hurrying
about, or is busily occupied; or has not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
made favourable use of the ground, or has
let pass the opportunity; or one who has
come a long distance, and those in rear are
late and have not rested.</p>
<p>“Strike an enemy who is half across
waters; or who is on a difficult or narrow
road; or whose flags and banners are in
confusion; or who is frequently changing
position; or whose general is not in accord
with the soldiers; or who is fearful.</p>
<p>“All such should be assaulted by the
picked men; and the remainder of the
army should be divided, and follow after
them. They may be attacked at once
without hesitation.”</p>

CONTROL OF THE ARMY</h2>
<p>Lord Wen said:—</p>
<p>“What is of first importance in operations
of war?”</p>
<p>Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“Lightness, of which there are four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
natures, Weight, of which there are two
natures, and Confidence must be clearly
comprehended.”</p>
<p>And Wen said:—</p>
<p>“What are these?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered:—</p>
<p>“If the way be easy, the horses are light
of foot; if the horses be light of foot, the
chariots travel freely; if the chariots travel
easily, men can ride in them without
difficulty; if the men be free to move,
the fight prospers. If the difficult and easy
ways be known, the horses are lightened;
if the horses be fed at proper intervals, the
chariots are swift; if there be plenty of oil
on the axles of the chariots, the riders are
quickly conveyed; if the spears be sharp
and the armour strong, the men make the
fight easy.</p>
<p>“Large rewards in advance, heavy
punishment in retreat, and impartiality
in their bestowal are required.</p>
<p>“He who well understands these things
is the master of victory.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>“By what means can the army gain the
victory?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered:—</p>
<p>“The foundation of victory is good
government.”</p>
<p>Again, Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“Is it not determined by numbers?”</p>
<p>And Wu replied:—</p>
<p>“If laws and orders be not clear; if
rewards and punishments be not just; if
the bell be sounded and they halt not, or
drum be beaten and men do not advance;
even if there be a hundred thousand men
at arms, they are of no avail.</p>
<p>“Where there is order, then there is
propriety at rest, and dignity in motion;
none can withstand the attack, and retreat
forbids pursuit; motion is regulated, and
movements to right and left are made in
answer to the signal; if the ranks be
cut asunder, formation is preserved; if
scattered, they are maintained; in fortune
or in danger, there is unity; if a number
be collected, they cannot be separated;
they may be used but not wearied; in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
whatever situation they are placed, nothing
under heaven can withstand them. The
army may be called a father and his
children.”</p>
<p>And Wu said:—</p>
<p>“In marching, movements and halts must
be properly adjusted, suitable occasions for
rationing not missed; the strength of men
and horses not exhausted. If these three
things be observed, the commands of the
superior can be carried out; if the commands
of the superior be carried out, order is maintained.
If advances and halts be without
method, victualling unsuitable, horses and
men tired and weary—neither unsaddled or
housed—it is because the orders cannot
be obeyed; if the orders be set aside,
there is disorder in the camp, and in
battle—defeat.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“On that depository of corpses, the battlefield,
if there be certain expectation of
death, there is life; if there be happy
expectation of life, there is death. The
good general is like unto one sitting in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a leaking ship, or lying under a burning
roof; the wisest man cannot contrive
against him; the strongest man cannot
destroy his composure; and the enemy’s
onslaught can be withstood. For procrastination
is the greatest enemy of the
general; disasters to the army are born of
indecision.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“Men meet their death from lack of
ability or unskilfulness. Wherefore training
is the first requirement of war. One man
with a knowledge of war can teach ten; ten
men skilled in war can teach one hundred;
one hundred can teach one thousand; one
thousand can teach ten thousand; and ten
thousand men can train an army.</p>
<p>“An enemy from a distance should be
awaited, and struck at short range; an
enemy that is tired should be met in good
order; hunger should be opposed by full
bellies; the battle formation should be
round or square, the men should kneel or
stand; go or remain; move to the right
or left; advance or retire; concentrate or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
disperse; close or extend when the signal
is given.</p>
<p>“All these changes must be learnt, and
the weapons distributed. This is the
business of the general.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“In the teaching of war, spears are given
to the short; bows and catapults to the tall;
banners and standards to the strong; the
bell and drum to the bold; fodder and
provisions to the feeble; the arrangement
of the plan to the wise. Men of the same
district should be united; and groups and
squads should help each other. At one
beat of the drum the ranks are put in
order; at two beats of the drum, formation
will be made; at three beats of the drum,
food will be issued; at four beats of the
drum, the men will prepare to march; at
five beats of the drum, ranks will be formed;
when the drums beat together, then the
standards will be raised.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“What is the way of marching and halting
an army?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>And Wu answered:—</p>
<p>“Natural ovens and dragons’ heads should
be avoided. Natural ovens are the mouths
of large valleys. Dragons’ heads are the
extremities of large mountains. The green
dragons (banners) should be placed on the
left, and the white tigers on the right; the
red sparrows in front; the snakes and
tortoises behind; the pole star (standard)
above; and the soldiers will look to the
standard.</p>
<p>“When going forth to battle, the direction
of the wind must be studied; if blowing
in the direction of the enemy, the soldiers
will be assembled and follow the wind; if a
head wind, the position will be strengthened,
and a wait made for the wind to change.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“In what way should horses be treated?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“The places where they are kept should
be made comfortable; fodder should be
suitable and timely. In winter their stables
should be warmed, and in summer sheltered
from the heat; their coats clipped, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
feet carefully pared, their attention directed
so that they be not alarmed, their paces
regulated, and their going and halting
trained; horses and men should be in accord,
and then the horses can be used. The
harness, the saddle, bit, bridle, and reins
must be strong; if the horse be without
vice at the beginning, he can be used to
the end; if the horse be hungry it is good;
if his belly be full, his value decreases; if
the sun be falling and the way still long,
dismount frequently. For it is proper that
the men be worked, but the horses must be
used with discretion, so that they may be
prepared should the enemy suddenly attack
us.</p>
<p>“If these things be well known, then
there is free passage under heaven.”</p>

<h2><a id="wutzu_IV">IV</a><br>
QUALITIES OF THE GENERAL</h2>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“The leader of the army is one who is
master of both arms and letters. He who
is both brave and tender can be entrusted
with troops.</p>
<p>“In the popular estimation of generals,
courage alone is regarded; nevertheless,
courage is but one of the qualifications of
the leader. Courage is heedless in encounter;
and rash encounter, which is
ignorant of the consequences, cannot be
called good.</p>
<p>“There are five matters which leaders
must carefully consider.</p>
<p>“First, reason; second, preparation;
third, determination; fourth, vigilance;
fifth, simplicity.</p>
<p>“With reason, a multitude can be controlled
like a small number.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>“Preparedness sees an enemy outside the
gate.</p>
<p>“Determination before the enemy has no
thought of life.</p>
<p>“Even after a victory, vigilance behaves
as before the first encounter.</p>
<p>“Simplicity ensures few regulations, and
preserves order.</p>
<p>“When the leader receives his orders, he
forthwith departs. Not until the enemy
has been vanquished does he speak of
return. This is the duty of the general.</p>
<p>“Wherefore, from the day of departure
of the army, the general seeks glory in
death, and dreams not of return in dishonour.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“In war there are four important influences.</p>
<p>“First, spirit; second, ground; third,
opportunity; fourth, force.</p>
<p>“The military value of the nation’s forces—of
one hundred times ten thousand
fighting men—depends upon the personality
of one man alone; this is called the
influence of spirit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>“When the road is steep and narrow, when
there are famous mountains and fastnesses
where ten men can defend and one thousand
cannot pass them by; such is the influence
of ground.</p>
<p>“When spies have been skilfully sown, and
mounted men pass to and from the enemy’s
camp, so that his masses are divided, his
sovereign and ministers vexed with each
other, and superiors and inferiors mutually
censorious; this is the moment of opportunity.</p>
<p>“When the linch-pins are secure, the oars
and sweeps ready for use in the boats, the
armed men trained for war, and the horses
exercised, we have what is called the influence
of force.</p>
<p>“He who understands these four matters
has the qualifications of a general. Furthermore,
dignity, virtue, benevolence, courage,
are needed to lead the troops, to calm
the multitude, to put fear in the enemy,
to remove doubts. When orders are
issued, the subordinates do not defy them.
Wheresoever the army is, that place the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
enemy avoids. If these four virtues be
present, the country is strong; if they be
not present, the country is overthrown.</p>
<p>“Of such is the good general.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“The use of drums and bells is to attract
the ear; of flags, standards, and banners to
strike the eye; of laws and penalties to
put fear in the heart.</p>
<p>“To attract the ear the sound must be
clear; to strike the eye the colours must
be bright. The heart is awed by punishment,
therefore punishment must be strict.</p>
<p>“If these three matters be not ordered,
the state may, peradventure, be preserved,
but defeat by the enemy is certain. Therefore,
as it has been said (if these three
things be present), there is no departing
from the commands of the general; when
he orders, there is no going back from
death.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“The secret of war is, first, to know who
is the enemy’s general, and to judge his
ability. If our plans depend on his dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>positions,
then success will be achieved
without toil.</p>
<p>“If their general be stupid, and heedlessly
trustful, he may be enticed by fraud; if
he be avaricious and careless of his fame,
he may be bribed with gifts. If he make
unconsidered movements without plan, he
should be tired out and placed in difficulties.
If the superiors be wealthy and proud,
and the inferiors avaricious and resentful,
they should be set against each other. An
enemy that is undetermined, now advancing
and then retreating, whose soldiers have
nought wherein to put their trust, should
be alarmed, and put to flight.</p>
<p>“When an enemy thinks lightly of the
general, and desires to return home, the
easy roads should be blocked, and the
difficult and narrow roads opened; await
their coming and capture them.</p>
<p>“If their advance be easy and retreat difficult,
await their coming and then advance
against them.</p>
<p>“If their advance be difficult and retreat
easy, then press and strike them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>“An army that is camped in marshy
ground, where there are no water-courses,
and long and frequent rains, should be
inundated.</p>
<p>“An army that is camped in wild
marshes, covered with dark and overhanging
grass and brambles, and swept by
frequent high winds, should be overthrown
by fire.</p>
<p>“An army that has halted long without
moving; whose general and soldiers have
grown careless, and neglect precautions,
should be approached by stealth, and taken
by surprise.”</p>
<p>Lord Wen asked, saying:—</p>
<p>“If the two armies be facing each other,
and the name of the enemy’s general unknown,
in what manner can we discover
it?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“A brave man of low degree, lightly
but well equipped, should be employed.
He should think only of flight and naught
of advantage. Then, if he observe the
enemy’s pursuit, if there be first a halt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and then an advance, order is established.
If we retreat and the enemy pursue, but
pretend not to be able to overtake us,
see an advantage but pretend not to be
aware of it, then their general may be
called a wise general, and conflict with
him must be avoided. If their army be
full of uproar; their banners and standards
disordered, their soldiers going about or
remaining of their own accord, some in
line, others in column; if such an enemy
be eager to pursue, and see an advantage
which they are desperate to seize, then
their general is a fool: even if there be
a host, they may be taken.”</p>

<h2><a id="wutzu_V">V</a><br>
SUITING THE OCCASION</h2>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If strong chariots, good horses, strong
and valiant soldiers suddenly meet the
enemy, and are thrown into confusion, and
ranks broken, what should be done?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“In general, the method of fighting is
to effect order in daylight by means of
flags and banners, pennons and batons;
at night by gongs and drums, whistles
and flutes. If a signal be made to the
left, the troops move to the left; if to the
right, they move to the right. Advance
is made at the sound of the drum; halt
at the sound of the gong; one blast of
the whistle is for advance, two for the
rally. If those who disobey be cut down,
the forces are subject to authority. If
officers and soldiers carry out orders, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
superior enemy cannot exist; no position
is impregnable in the attack.”</p>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“What is to be done if the enemy be
many and we be few?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“Avoid such an enemy on open ground,
and meet him in the narrow way; for,
as it is written, if 1 is to stand against
1,000, there is naught better than a pass;
if 10 are to hold against 100, there is
nothing better than a steep place; if
1,000 are to strike 10,000, there is nothing
better than a difficult place. If a small
force, with beat of gong and drum, suddenly
arise in a narrow way, even a host will
be upset. Wherefore it is written: ‘He
who has a multitude seeks the plain, and
he who has few seeks the narrow way.’”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“A mighty host, strong and courageous,
which is on the defence with a mountain
behind, a precipice between, high ground
on the right, and a river on the left, with
deep moats, and high walls, and which has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
artillery; whose retreat is like the removal
of a mountain, advance like the hurricane,
and whose supplies are in abundance, is
an enemy against whom long defence is
difficult. In effect, what should be done
in such a case?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“This indeed is a great question, whose
issue depends, not upon the might of
chariot and horse, but upon the schemes
of a wise man.</p>
<p>“Let 1,000 chariots and 10,000 horse, well
equipped and with foot-men added to them,
be divided into five armies, and a road
allotted to each army.</p>
<p>“Then if there be five armies, and each
army take a different road, the enemy will
be puzzled, and know not in what quarter
to be prepared. If the enemy’s defence be
strong and united, send envoys quickly to
him to discover his intention. If he listen
to our advices, he will strike camp and
withdraw. But, if he listen not to our
advice, but strikes down the messenger, and
burns his papers, then divide and attack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
from five quarters. If victorious, do not
pursue; if defeated, flee to a distance. If
feigning retreat, proceed slowly, and, if the
enemy approach, strike swiftly.</p>
<p>“One army will hold the enemy in front,
with another cut his rear, two more with
gags in their mouths<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21">[21]</a> will attack his weak
point, whether on the right or on the
left. If five armies thus make alternate
onslaughts, success is certain.</p>
<p>“This is the way to strike strength.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If the enemy draw near and encompass
us, and we would retreat, but there is no
way, and in our multitude there is fear,
what should be done?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“In such a case, if we be many and they
be few, divide and fall upon them; if the
enemy be many and we be few, use
stratagem and act according to opportunity;
and if opportunities be untiringly seized,
even if the enemy be many, he will be
reduced to subjection.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If, in a narrow valley with steep places on
either side, the enemy be met, and they are
many and we are few, what should be done?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“If they be met among hills, woods, in
deep mountains, or wide fens, advance
quickly, retire swiftly, and hesitate not. If
the enemy be suddenly met among high
mountains or deep valleys, be the first to
strike the drum and fall upon them. Let
bow and cross bow advance; shoot and
capture; observe the state of their ranks;
and, if there be confusion, do not hesitate
to strike.”</p>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If the enemy be suddenly met in a
narrow place with high mountains on either
side, and advance and retreat are alike
impossible, what should be done in such a
case?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“This is called War in valleys where
numbers are of no avail. The ablest officers
should be collected, and set against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
enemy. Men light of foot and well armed
should be placed in front; the chariots
divided; the horsemen drawn up, and placed
in ambush on four sides, with many leagues
between, and without showing their weapons.
Then, the enemy will certainly make his
defence firm, and neither advance or retreat.
Whereupon, the standards will be raised,
and the ranks of banners shown, the
mountains left, and camp pitched in the
plain.</p>
<p>“The enemy will then be fearful, and
should be challenged by chariot and horse,
and allowed no rest.</p>
<p>“This is the method of fighting in valleys.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If the enemy be met in a marsh where
the water is out, so that the wheels of the
chariots sink in, and the shafts be covered,
and the chariots and horsemen overcome by
the waters, when there are no boats or oars,
and it is impossible either to advance or
retreat, what should be done in such a
case?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>“This is called water fighting. Chariots
and horsemen cannot be used, and they
must be put for a time on one side. Go up
to the top of a high place, and look out to
the four quarters. Then the state of the
waters will certainly be seen; their extent,
and the deep places and shallows fully
ascertained. Then, by stratagem, the enemy
may be defeated.</p>
<p>“If the enemy should cross the waters he
should be engaged when half over.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If there has been long continued rain
so that the horses sink, and the chariots
cannot move; if the enemy appear from
four quarters, and the forces are frightened,
what is the course in such a case?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“When wet and overcast, the chariots
should halt; when fine and dry, they should
arise. Seek height, and avoid low places;
drive the strong chariots, and choose well
the road on which to advance or halt. If
the enemy suddenly arise, immediately
pursue them.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If our fields and pastures be suddenly
pillaged, and our oxen and sheep taken,
what should be done?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“Lawless enemies that arise are to be
feared; defend well and do not reply.
When, at sunset, they seek to withdraw,
they will certainly be overladen and fearful.
Striving to return quickly to their homes,
connection will be lost. Then if they be pursued
and attacked, they can be overthrown.”</p>
<p>Wu the Master said:—</p>
<p>“The way of attacking the enemy and
investing his castle is as follows:—</p>
<p>“When the outlying buildings have been
taken, and the assaulting parties enter the
innermost sanctuary, make use of the
enemy’s officials, and take charge of their
weapons. Let the army on no account fell
trees or enter dwellings, cut the crops, slay
the six domestic animals, or burn the barns;
and show the people that there is no cruel
desire. Those who wish to surrender, should
be received and freed from anxiety.”</p>

<h2><a id="wutzu_VI">VI</a><br>
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE TROOPS</h2>
<p>And Lord Wen asked and said:—</p>
<p>“If punishment be just and reward impartial,
is victory thereby gained?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“I cannot speak of all the things that
concern justice and impartiality, but on
these alone dependence cannot be placed.</p>
<p>“If the people hear the word of command,
or listen to the order with rejoicing; if,
when the army be raised, and a multitude
assembled, they go forth gladly to the fight;
if, in the tumult of the fight, when blade
crosses blade, the soldiers gladly die; upon
these three things can the lord of the people
place his trust.”</p>
<p>And Lord Wen said:—</p>
<p>“How can this be brought about?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“Seek out merit, advance and reward it,
and encourage those without fame.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>Accordingly Lord Wen set seats in the
garden of the palace in three rows, and
made a feast unto his chief retainers. In
the first row were set those of chief
merit, and on the table were placed the
best meats and precious utensils. Those
of medium merit were set in the middle
row, and the utensils on the table were
fewer in number. Those without merit
were set in the last row, and utensils of
no value were put before them. And
when the feast was over, and they had all
departed, the parents, wives, and children
of those with merit were given presents
outside the gates of the palace according
to their degree.</p>
<p>Further, messengers were sent yearly
with gifts to condole with the parents of
those who had lost a son in the service of
the state, and to show that they were had
in remembrance.</p>
<p>And after this was carried out for three
years, the people of Chin gathered an army,
and came as far as the Western River.
And when the soldiers of Wei heard this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
without waiting for orders, they armed
themselves and fell upon them; and they
that went forth were 10,000 in number.</p>
<p>And Lord Wen called Wu and said:—</p>
<p>“The words that you spoke unto me,
have they not indeed been carried out?”</p>
<p>And Wu answered and said:—</p>
<p>“I have heard that there are men, great
and small; souls, grand and feeble.</p>
<p>“As a trial, let 50,000 men, without merit,
be collected, and placed under my command
against the country of Chin. If we fail, the
state will be the laughing-stock among the
princes, and its power under heaven will be
lost. If a desperate robber be hidden in
a wide plain, and 1,000 men be pursuing
him, their glances will be furtive like the
owl, looking backward like the wolf, for
they are in fear of harm from a sudden
onslaught.</p>
<p>“One desperate man can put fear in the
hearts of a thousand. Now, if this host
of 50,000 men become as a desperate thief,
and are led against Chin, there is nought
to fear.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>On hearing these words Lord Wen agreed,
and adding further 500 chariots and 3,000
horse, the hosts of Chin were overthrown,
all being due to the encouragement of the
troops.</p>
<p>On the day before the battle Wu gave
orders to the forces, saying:—</p>
<p>“The army will attack the enemy’s
chariots, horse and foot, in accordance
with our commands. If the chariots do
not capture the enemy’s chariots, or the
horse those of the enemy’s, or the foot the
enemy’s footmen, even if their army be
overthrown, no merit will be gained.”</p>
<p>Therefore on the day of the battle, the
orders were simple, and fear of Wei shook
the heavens.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work

Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
